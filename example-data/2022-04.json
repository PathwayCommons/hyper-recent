    "preprint_abstract": "Mammalian X-chromosome dosage balance is regulated by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and X-chromosome upregulation (XCU), but the dynamics of XCU as well as the interplay between the two mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we mapped XCU throughout early mouse embryonic development at cellular and allelic resolution, revealing sex- and lineage-specific dynamics along key events in X-chromosome regulation. Our data show that XCU is linearly proportional to the degree of XCI, indicating that dosage compensation ensues based on mRNA levels rather than number of active X chromosomes. In line with this, we reveal that the two active X chromosomes in female naive embryonic stem cells are not hyperactive as previously thought. In all lineages, XCU was underlain by increased transcriptional burst frequencies, providing a mechanistic basis in vivo. Together, our results demonstrate unappreciated flexibility of XCU in balancing X-chromosome expression, and we propose a general model for allelic dosage balance, applicable for wider mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Studying temporal gene expression shifts during disease progression provides important insights into the biological mechanisms that distinguish adaptive and maladaptive responses. Existing tools for the analysis of time course transcriptomic data are not designed to optimally identify distinct temporal patterns when analyzing dynamic differentially expressed genes (DDEGs). Moreover, there is a lack of methods to assess and visualize the temporal progression of biological pathways mapped from time course transcriptomic datasets. In this study, we developed an open-source R package TrendCatcher (https://github.com/jaleesr/TrendCatcher), which applies the smoothing spline ANOVA model and break point searching strategy to identify and visualize distinct dynamic transcriptional gene signatures and biological processes from longitudinal datasets. We used TrendCatcher to perform a systematic temporal analysis of COVID-19 peripheral blood transcriptomes, including bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq time course data. TrendCatcher uncovered the early and persistent activation of neutrophils and coagulation pathways as well as impaired type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in circulating cells as a hallmark of patients who progressed to severe COVID-19, whereas no such patterns were identified in individuals receiving SARS- CoV-2 vaccinations or patients with mild COVID-19. These results underscore the importance of systematic temporal analysis to identify early biomarkers and possible pathogenic therapeutic targets.",

    "preprint_abstract": "During decomposition of organic matter, microbial communities may follow different successional trajectories depending on the initial environment and colonizers. The timing and order of the assembly history can lead to divergent communities through priority effects. We explored how assembly history and resource quality affected fungal dead wood communities and decomposition, 1.5 and 4.5 years after tree felling. Additionally, we investigated the effect of invertebrate exclusion during the first two summers. For aspen (Populus tremula) logs, we measured initial resource quality of bark and wood, and surveyed the fungal communities by DNA metabarcoding at different time points during succession. We found that a gradient in fungal community composition was related to resource quality and discuss how this may reflect tolerance-dominance trade-offs in fungal life history strategies. As with previous studies, the initial amount of bark tannins was negatively correlated with wood decomposition rate over 4.5 years. The initial fungal community explained variation in community composition after 1.5, but not 4.5 years, of succession. Although the assembly history of initial colonizers may cause alternate trajectories in successional communities, our results indicate that the communities may easily converge with the arrival of secondary colonizers. We also identified a strong invertebrate-induced priority effect of fungal communities, even after 4.5 years of succession, thereby adding crucial knowledge to the importance of invertebrates in affecting fungal community development. By measuring and manipulating aspects of assembly history and resource quality that have rarely been studied, we expand our understanding of the complexity of fungal community dynamics.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The biopharmaceutical industry is transitioning towards adoption of continuous biomanufacturing practices that are often more flexible and efficient than traditional batch processes. Regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are further urging use of advanced PAT to analyze the design space to increase process knowledge and enable high quality biologics production. Post-translational modification of proteins, such as N-linked glycosylation are often critical quality attributes known to affect biologics safety and efficacy hence requiring close monitoring during manufacturing. Here, we developed an online sequential-injection based PAT system, called N-GLYcanyzer, that can rapidly monitor mAb glycosylation during upstream biomanufacturing. The key innovation includes design of an integrated mAb sampling and derivation system for antibody titer and glycoform analysis in under 2 hours. The N-GLYcanyzer process includes mAb capture, deglycosylation, fluorescent glycan labeling, and glycan enrichment for direct injection and analysis on an integrated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Different fluorescent tags and reductants were tested to maximize glycan labeling efficiency under aqueous conditions, while porous graphitized carbon (PGC) was studied for optimum glycan recovery and enrichment. We find that 2-AB labeling of glycans with 2-picoline borane as a reducing agent, using the N-GLYcanyzer workflow, gives higher glycan labeling efficiency under aqueous conditions leading to upwards of a 5-fold increase in fluorescent products intensity. Finally, we showcase how the N-GLYcanyzer platform can be implemented at/on-line to an upstream bioreactor for automated and near real-time glycosylation monitoring of a Trastuzumab biosimilar produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/468439v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fbb698org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@90da13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd45e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17fadd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG N-GLYcanyzer is an automated PAT toolkit for rapid sample processing for mAb N-linked glycans analysis to enable advanced biologics manufacturing\n\nC_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "Molecular studies of genome regulation often rely on the ability to map where specific proteins interact with genomic DNA. Existing techniques for mapping protein-DNA interactions genome-wide rely on DNA amplification methods followed by sequencing with short reads, which dissociates joint binding information at neighboring sites, removes endogenous DNA methylation information, and precludes the ability to reliably map interactions in repetitive regions of the genome. To address these limitations, we created a new protein-DNA mapping method, called Directed Methylation with Long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq), which methylates DNA near each target proteins DNA binding site in situ, then leverages the ability to distinguish methylated and unmethylated bases on long, native DNA molecules using long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the optimization and utility of this method by mapping the interaction sites of a variety of different proteins and histone modifications across the human genome, achieving a single-molecule binding site resolution of less than 200 bp. Furthermore, we mapped the positions of the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A in repetitive regions that are unmappable with short reads, while simultaneously analyzing endogenous CpG methylation and joint binding events on single molecules. DiMeLo-seq is a versatile method that can provide multimodal and truly genome-wide information for investigating protein-DNA interactions.",

Here, we present an extensive study of newly assembled peri/centromeric sequences representing 6.2% (189.9 Mb) of the first complete, telomere-to-telomere human genome assembly (T2T-CHM13). We discovered novel patterns of peri/centromeric repeat organization, variation, and evolution at both large and small length scales. We also found that inner kinetochore proteins tend to overlap the most recently duplicated subregions within centromeres. Finally, we compared chromosome X centromeres across a diverse panel of individuals and uncovered structural, epigenetic, and sequence variation at single-base resolution across these regions. In total, this work provides an unprecedented atlas of human centromeres to guide future studies of their complex and critical functions as well as their unique evolutionary dynamics.\n\nOne-sentence summaryDeep characterization of fully assembled human centromeres reveals their architecture and fine-scale organization, variation, and evolution.",

In both environments, the bacterium is subject to interbacterial competition. A molecular nanomachine that is often involved in such competitive behavior is the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Interestingly and in contrast to non-pandemic or environmental isolates, the T6SS of the O1 El Tor clade of V. cholerae, which is responsible for the ongoing 7th pandemic, is largely silent under standard conditions. Instead, these strains induce their full T6SS capacity only under specific conditions such as growth on chitinous surfaces (signaled through TfoX and QstR) or when the cells encounter low intracellular c-di-GMP levels (TfoY-driven). In this study, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within an intergenic region of the major T6SS gene cluster of V. cholerae that determines the T6SS status of the cell. We show that SNP conversion is sufficient to induce T6SS production in numerous pandemic strains, while the converse approach renders non-pandemic/environmental V. cholerae strains T6SS-silent. We further demonstrate that SNP-dependent T6SS production occurs independently of the known T6SS regulators TfoX, QstR, and TfoY. Finally, we identify a putative promoter region adjacent to the identified SNP that is required for all forms of T6SS regulation.",

In this study, mathematical models of normal and DSB-damaged yeast chromosomes were developed to simulate their structural dynamics. The effects of histone degradation in the whole nucleus and the change in the physical properties of damaged loci due to the binding of SUMOylated repair proteins were considered in the model of DSB-induced chromosomes based on recent experimental results. The simulation results reproduced DSB-induced changes to structural and dynamical features by which the combination of whole nuclear histone degradation and the rigid structure formation of repair protein accumulations on damaged loci were suggested to be primary contributors to the process by which damaged loci are relocated to the nuclear periphery.",

    "preprint_abstract": "ObjectivePersons with tetraplegia can use brain-machine interfaces to make visually guided reaches with robotic arms. Without somatosensory feedback, these movements will likely be slow and imprecise, like those of persons who retain movement but have lost proprioception. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) has promise for providing artificial somatosensory feedback. If ICMS can mimic naturally occurring neural activity, afferent interfaces may be more informative and easier to learn than interfaces that evoke unnaturalistic activity. To develop such biomimetic stimulation patterns, it is important to characterize the responses of neurons to ICMS.\n\nApproachUsing a Utah multi-electrode array, we recorded activity evoked by single pulses, and short (~0.2 s) and long (~4 s) trains of ICMS at a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies. As the electrical artifact caused by ICMS typically prevents recording for many milliseconds, we deployed a custom rapid-recovery amplifier with nonlinear gain to limit signal saturation on the stimulated electrode. Across all electrodes after stimulation, we removed the remaining slow return to baseline with acausal high-pass filtering of time-reversed recordings. With these techniques, we could record ~0.7 ms after stimulation offset even on the stimulated electrode.\n\nMain resultsWe recorded likely transsynaptically-evoked activity as early as ~0.7 ms after single pulses of stimulation that was immediately followed by suppressed neural activity lasting 10-150 ms. Instead of this long-lasting inhibition, neurons increased their firing rates for ~100 ms after trains. During long trains, the evoked response on the stimulated electrode decayed rapidly while the response was maintained on non-stimulated channels.\n\nSignificanceThe detailed description of the spatial and temporal response to ICMS can be used to better interpret results from experiments that probe circuit connectivity or function of cortical areas. These results can also contribute to the design of stimulation patterns to improve afferent interfaces for artificial sensory feedback.",

Inferring the dynamics of local CRE dissemination is currently limited by our inability to confidently trace the spread of resistance determinants to unrelated bacterial hosts. Whole genome sequence comparison is useful for identifying CRE clonal transmission and outbreaks, but high-frequency horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of carbapenem resistance genes and subsequent genome rearrangement complicate tracing the local persistence and mobilization of these genes across organisms.\n\nMethodsTo overcome this limitation, we developed a new approach to identify recent HGT of large, near-identical plasmid segments across species boundaries, which also allowed us to overcome technical challenges with genome assembly. We applied this to complete and near-complete genome assemblies to examine the local spread of CRE in a systematic, prospective collection of all CRE, as well as time- and species-matched carbapenem susceptible Enterobacterales, isolated from patients from four U.S. hospitals over nearly five years.\n\nResultsOur CRE collection comprised a diverse range of species, lineages and carbapenem resistance mechanisms, many of which were encoded on a variety of promiscuous plasmid types. We found and quantified rearrangement, persistence, and repeated transfer of plasmid segments, including those harboring carbapenemases, between organisms over multiple years. Some plasmid segments were found to be strongly associated with specific locales, thus representing geographic signatures that make it possible to trace recent and localized HGT events.\n\nFunctional analysis of these signatures revealed genes commonly found in plasmids of nosocomial pathogens, such as functions required for plasmid retention and spread, as well survival against a variety of antibiotic and antiseptics common to the hospital environment.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, the framework we developed provides a clearer, high resolution picture of the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance importation, spread, and persistence in patients and healthcare networks.",

In bone tissue engineering, the deposited mineralized matrix is one of the main outcome parameters, but using different brands of FBS can result in large variations. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is present in FBS. Not only is ALP used to judge the osteogenic differentiation of bone cells, it may affect deposition of mineralized matrix. The present study focused on the enzymatic activity of ALP in FBS of different suppliers and its contribution to mineralization in osteogenic differentiation cultures. It was hypothesized that culturing cells in a medium with high intrinsic ALP activity of FBS will lead to higher mineral deposition compared to media with lower ALP activity. The used FBS types were shown to have significant differences in enzymatic ALP activity. Our results indicate that the ALP activity of the medium not only affected the deposited mineralized matrix but also the osteogenic differentiation of cells as measured by a changed cellular ALP activity of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSC). In media with low inherent ALP activity, the cellular ALP activity was increased and played the major role in the mineralization process; while, in media with high intrinsic ALP activity contribution from the serum, less cellular ALP activity was measured and the ALP activity of the medium also contributed to mineral formation substantially. Our results highlight the diverse effects of ALP activity intrinsic to FBS on osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization and how FBS can determine the experimental outcomes, in particular for studies investigating matrix mineralization. Once again, the need to replace FBS with more controlled and known additives is highlighted.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=55 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/462693v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@902078org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@43b6fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a244fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ef819_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Murine MAIT cells were reprogrammed into iPSCs and redifferentiated towards MAIT-like cells (m-reMAIT cells). m-reMAIT cells were activated by an agonist and MR1-tetramer, a reagent to detect MAIT cells, in the presence and absence of antigen-presenting cells. This activation accompanied protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the production of T helper (Th)1-, Th2-, and Th17-cytokines and inflammatory chemokines. Upon adoptive transfer, m-reMAIT cells migrated to different organs with maturation in mice. Furthermore, m-reMAIT cells prolonged mouse survival upon tumor inoculation through the NK cell-mediated reinforcement of cytolytic activity. Collectively, the present results demonstrated the utility and role of m-reMAIT cells in tumor immunity, and will contribute to insights into the function of MAIT cells in immunity.",

Despite the growing body of literature on the physiological life-history and molecular genetic mechanism underlying the temperature-size rule, the overall genetic architecture orchestrating this complex phenotype is not yet fully understood. One approach to identify genetic regulators of complex phenotypes is Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping. Here, we explore the genetic architecture of body size phenotypes, and plasticity of body-size phenotypes in different temperatures using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model ectotherm. We used 40 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from N2 and CB4856, which were reared at four different temperatures (16{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C, 24{degrees}C, and 26{degrees}C) and measured at two developmental stages (L4 and adult). The animals were measured for body length, width at vulva, body volume, length/width ratio, and seven other body-size traits. The genetically diverse RILs varied in their body-size phenotypes with heritabilities ranging from 0.0 to 0.99. We detected 18 QTL underlying the body-size traits across all treatment combinations, with the majority clustering on Chromosome X. We hypothesize that the Chromosome X QTL could result from a known pleiotropic regulator - npr-1 - known to affect the body size of C. elegans through behavioral changes. We also found five plasticity QTL of body-size which three of them colocalized with some body-size QTL at certain temperature. In conclusion, our findings shed more light on multiple loci affecting body size plasticity and the possibility of co-regulation of traits and traits plasticity by the same loci under different environment.",

The neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 are among the most promising strategies to prevent and treat COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) profoundly reduced the efficacies of most of mAbs and vaccines approved for clinical use. Herein, we demonstrated mAb 35B5 efficiently neutralizes both wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs, including B.1.617.2 (delta) variant, in vitro and in vivo. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that 35B5 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by targeting a unique epitope that avoids the prevailing mutation sites on RBD identified in circulating VOCs, providing the molecular basis for its pan-neutralizing efficacy. The 35B5-binding epitope could also be exploited for the rational design of a universal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

However, 2D snapshots of a vascular bed capture only a small fraction of its complexity. Recent efforts to synaptically map neuronal circuitry using volume electron microscopy have also sampled the brain microvasculature in 3D. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of 6 data sets spanning different species and brain regions, including 2 data sets from the MICrONS consortium that have made efforts to segment vasculature in addition to all parenchymal cell types in mouse visual cortex. Exploration of these data have revealed rich information for detailed investigation of the cerebrovasculature. Neurovascular unit cell types (including, but not limited to, endothelial cells, mural cells, perivascular fibroblasts, microglia, and astrocytes) could be discerned across broad microvascular zones. Image contrast was sufficient to identify subcellular details, including endothelial junctions, caveolae, peg-and-socket interactions, mitochondria, Golgi cisternae, microvilli and other cellular protrusions of potential significance to vascular signaling. Additionally, noncellular structures including the basement membrane and perivascular spaces were visible and could be traced between arterio-venous zones along the vascular wall. These explorations revealed structural features that may be important for vascular functions, such as blood-brain barrier integrity, blood flow control, brain clearance, and bioenergetics. They also identified limitations where accuracy and consistency of segmentation could be further honed by future efforts. The purpose of this article is to introduce these valuable community resources within the framework of cerebrovascular research by providing an assessment of their vascular contents, identifying features of significance for further study, and discussing next step ideas for refining vascular segmentation and analysis.",

Bacteria often simultaneously deploy multiple public goods with complementary functions. This raises the question whether natural selection could favour division of labour where subpopulations or species specialise in the production of a single public good, whilst sharing the complementary goods at the group level. Here we use an experimental system, where we genetically enforce specialization in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with regard to the production of its two siderophores, pyochelin and pyoverdine, and explore the conditions under which specialization can lead to division of labour. When growing pyochelin and pyoverdine specialists at different mixing ratios in various iron limited environments, we found that specialists could only successfully complement each other in environments with moderate iron limitation and grow as good as the generalist wildtype but not better. Under more stringent iron limitation, the dynamics in specialist communities was characterized by mutual cheating and with higher proportions of pyochelin producers greatly compromising group productivity. Nonetheless, specialist communities remained stable through negative frequency-dependent selection. Our work shows that specialization in a bacterial community can be spurred by mutual cheating and does not necessarily result in beneficial division of labour. We propose that natural selection might favour fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms in generalists over division of labour because the former enables generalists to remain flexible and adequately adjust public good investments in fluctuating environments.",

Better knowledge on composition of these mixtures, and on mechanisms of how the individual CPs interact, could inspire development of laboratory CP formulations optimized for cryopreservation of cells and other biological material. Here we identify and quantify (using high resolution mass spectrometry) a range of putative CPs in larval tissues of a subarctic fly, Chymomyza costata that survives long-term cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. The CPs (proline, trehalose, glutamine, asparagine, glycine betaine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphocholine, and sarcosine) accumulate in hemolymph in a ratio of 313:108:55:26:6:4:3:0.5 mmol.L-1. Using calorimetry, we show that the artificial mixtures, mimicking the concentrations of major CPs in hemolymph of freeze-tolerant larvae, suppress the melting point of water and significantly reduce the ice fraction. We demonstrate in a bioassay that mixtures of CPs administered through the diet act synergistically rather than additively to enable cryopreservation of otherwise freeze-sensitive larvae. Using MALDI-MSI, we show that during slow extracellular freezing trehalose becomes concentrated in partially dehydrated hemolymph where it stimulates transition to the amorphous glass phase. In contrast, proline moves to the boundary between extracellular ice and dehydrated hemolymph and tissues where it likely forms a layer of dense viscoelastic liquid. We propose that amorphous glass and viscoelastic liquids may protect macromolecules and cells from thermomechanical shocks associated with freezing and transfer into and out of liquid nitrogen.\n\nSummary statementThe composition of natural cryoprotectant mixture of the extremely freeze-tolerant insect is revealed.

Museums around the world are currently imaging specimens, capturing specimen data, and making them freely available online.

Applying CV to digitised NHCs has the potential to greatly accelerate the use of NHCs for biotic response to global change research. In this paper, we apply CV to a very large, digitised collection to test hypotheses in an established area of biotic response to climate change research: temperature-size responses.\nC_LIO_LIWe develop a CV pipeline (Mothra) and apply it to the NHM iCollections of British butterflies (>180,000 specimens). Mothra automatically detects the specimen in the image, sets the scale, measures wing features (e.g., forewing length), determines the orientation of the specimen (pinned ventrally or dorsally), and identifies the sex. We pair these measurements and meta-data with temperature records to test how adult size varies with temperature during the immature stages of species and to assess patterns of sexual-size dimorphism across species and families.\nC_LIO_LIMothra accurately measures the forewing lengths of butterfly specimens and compared to manual baseline measurements, Mothra accurately determines sex and forewing lengths of butterfly specimens. Females are the larger sex in most species and an increase in adult body size with warm monthly temperatures during the late larval stages is the most common temperature size response. These results confirm suspected patterns and support hypotheses based on recent studies using a smaller dataset of manually measured specimens.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that CV can be a powerful tool to efficiently and accurately extract phenotypic data from a very large collection of digital NHCs. In the future, CV will become widely applied to digital NHC collections to advance ecological and evolutionary research and to accelerate the use of NHCs for biotic response to global change research.\nC_LI",

Decentralized models provide a way to build more accurate and generalizable prediction models, bypassing the traditional data-sharing methodology. In this work, we propose a decentralized method for brain age estimation and evaluate it on three different feature sets, including both volumetric and voxelwise structural MRI data as well as resting functional MRI data.

Here we first show that the decision boundary can be monitored using a novel, model-free behavioral method, termed Decision-Classification Boundary. This method allowed us to both provide direct support for evidence-integration contributions and to identify a novel integration-bias, whereby incoming evidence is modulated based on its consistency with evidence from preceding time-frames. This consistency bias was supported in three cross-domain experiments, involving decisions with perceptual and numerical evidence, which showed that choice-accuracy and decision confidence are modulated by stimulus consistency. Strikingly, despite its seeming sub-optimality, this bias fosters performance by enhancing robustness to integration noise. We argue this bias constitutes a new form of micro-level, within-trial, confirmation bias and discuss implications to broad aspects of decision making.",

Individual differences in the initial sensitivity to alcohol are controlled in part by genetic factors. Mice offer a powerful tool for elucidating the genetic basis of behavioral and physiological traits relevant to AUDs; but conventional experimental crosses have only been able to identify large chromosomal regions rather than specific genes. Genetically diverse, highly recombinant mouse populations allow for the opportunity to observe a wider range of phenotypic variation, offer greater mapping precision, and thus increase the potential for efficient gene identification.\n\nMethodsWe have taken advantage of the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and precisely map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with ethanol sensitivity. We phenotyped 798 male J:DO mice for three measures of ethanol sensitivity: ataxia, hypothermia, and loss of the righting response. We used high density MEGAMuga and GIGAMuga arrays to obtain genotypes ranging from 77,808 - 143,259 SNPs. In addition, we performed RNA sequencing in striatum to map expression QTLs and to identify gene expression-trait correlations.\n\nResultsWe then applied a systems genetic strategy to identify narrow QTLs and construct the network of correlations that exist between DNA sequence, gene expression values and ethanol-related phenotypes to prioritize our list of positional candidate genes.\n\nConclusionsOur results can be used to identify alleles that contribute to AUDs in humans, elucidate causative biological mechanisms, or assist in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.",

Currently, only a few deep learning approaches that involve peptide fragmentation spectra, which represent partial sequence information of proteins, exist. Commonly, these approaches lack the ability to characterize less studied or even unknown patterns in spectra because of their use of explicit domain knowledge. To elevate unrestricted learning from spectra, we introduce AHLF, a deep learning model that is end-to-end trained on 19.2 million spectra from multiple phosphoproteomic data sets. AHLF is interpretable and we show that peak-level feature importances and pairwise interactions between peaks are in line with corresponding peptide fragments. We demonstrate our approach by detecting post-translational modifications, specifically protein phosphorylation based on only the fragmentation spectrum without a database search. AHLF increases the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) by an average of 9.4% on recent phosphoproteomic data compared to the current-state-of-the-art on this task. To show the broad applicability of AHLF we use transfer learning to also detect cross-linked peptides, as used in protein structure analysis, with an AUC of up to 94%. We expect our approach to directly apply to cell signaling and structural biology which use phosphoproteomic and cross-linking data, but in principal any mass spectrometry based study can benefit from an interpretable, end-to-end trained model like AHLF.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/ahlf\n\nContactbernhard.renard@hpi.de",

A theoretical analysis leads us to conclude that sensory decoding circuits for pursuit include multiple parallel pathways and multiple sources of variation. Behavioral and neural responses with biomimetic statistics emerge from a biologically-motivated circuit model with noise in the pathway that is dedicated to flexibly adjusting the strength of visual-motor transmission. Flexible adjustment of transmission strength applies much more broadly to issues in sensory-motor control such as Bayesian integration and control strategies to optimize motor behavior.",

While TDP-43 has been studied extensively in neuronal tissues, TDP-43 inclusions have also been described in the muscle of inclusion body myositis patients, highlighting the need to understand the role of TDP-43 beyond the central nervous system. Using RNA-seq we performed the first direct comparison of TDP-43-mediated transcription and alternative splicing in muscle (C2C12) and neuronal (NSC34) mouse cells. Our results clearly show that TDP-43 displays a tissue-characteristic behaviour targeting unique transcripts in each cell type. This is not due to variable transcript abundance but rather due to cell-specific expression of RNA-binding proteins, which influences TDP-43 performance. Among splicing events commonly dysregulated in both cell lines, we identified some that are TDP-43-dependent also in human cells and show that inclusion levels of these alternative exons appear to be differentially altered in affected tissues of FTLD and IBM patients. We therefore propose that TDP-43 dysfunction, reflected in aberrant splicing, contributes to disease development but it does so in a tissue- and disease-specific manner.",

In addition to driving oxidative phosphorylation, bacterial respiration has a variety of ancillary functions that obscure its contribution to pathogenesis. We find here that the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes encodes two respiratory pathways which are partially functionally redundant and indispensable for pathogenesis. Loss of respiration decreased NAD+ regeneration, but this could be specifically reversed by heterologous expression of a water-forming NADH oxidase (NOX). NOX expression fully rescued intracellular growth defects and increased L. monocytogenes loads >1,000-fold in a mouse infection model. Consistent with NAD+ regeneration maintaining L. monocytogenes viability and enabling immune evasion, a respiration-deficient strain exhibited elevated bacteriolysis within the host cytosol and NOX rescued this phenotype. These studies show that NAD+ regeneration, rather than oxidative phosphorylation, represents the primary role of L. monocytogenes respiration and highlight the nuanced relationship between bacterial metabolism, physiology, and pathogenesis.",

Sea lamprey larvae (ammocoetes) can spend several years in freshwater burrowed within soft sediments, inhibiting their detection and assessment. Here we present an environmental DNA (eDNA) assay to detect ammocoetes burrowed in the sediment. We performed a battery of tests that ensured both species-specificity of the assay as well as the capacity to detect ammocoetes when abundances are low. Experiments on burrowing activity suggested that most of the DNA released into the sediment occurs during burrowing.

It analyses synteny and multiple structural patterns of the pangenome, giving insights into the biological diversity and evolution of the studied taxon. Panakeia hence provides both broad and detailed information on the structure of a pangenome, for diverse and highly clonal populations of bacteria. Development of new pan-genome analysis tools is important, as the pangenome of a microbial species has become an important method to define the diversity of a selected taxon, most commonly a species, in the last years. This enables comparison of strains from different ecological niches and can be used to define the functional potential in a bacterial population. It gives us a much better view of microbial genomics than can be gained from singular genomes which after all are just single representatives of a much more varied population.\n\nPreviously published pangenome tools often reduce the information to a presence/absence matrix of unconnected genes or generate massive hard to interpret output graphs. However, Panakeia includes synteny and structural information and presents it in a way that can readily be used for further analysis.

Theoretical and empirical studies have made conflicting arguments on whether adaptive evolution may enhance or oppose the plastic response. Gene regulatory traits offer excellent potential to study the relationship between plasticity and adaptation, and they can now be studied at the transcriptomic level. Here we take advantage of three closely-related pairs of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from contrasting thermal environments that reflect three separate instances of cold tolerance evolution. We measure the transcriptome-wide plasticity in gene expression levels and alternative splicing (intron usage) between warm and cold laboratory environments. We find that suspected adaptive changes in both gene expression and alternative splicing tend to neutralize the ancestral plastic response. Further, we investigate the hypothesis that adaptive evolution can lead to decanalization of selected gene regulatory traits. We find strong evidence that suspected adaptive gene expression (but not splicing) changes in cold-adapted populations are more vulnerable to the genetic perturbation of inbreeding than putatively neutral changes. We find some evidence that these patterns may reflect a loss of genetic canalization accompanying adaptation, although other processes including hitchhiking recessive deleterious variants may contribute as well. Our findings augment our understanding of genetic and environmental effects on gene regulation in the context of adaptive evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is unclear whether adaptive evolution is concordant or discordant with regulatory plasticity, especially for splicing plasticity which is rarely studied. Here we analyzed RNA-seq data from three pairs of natural fly populations that represent separate adaptive evolution to cold climate. We found that adaptive evolution is generally discordant with the ancestral plasticity between cold and warm temperatures for gene expression abundance and splicing. We also investigate the hypothesis that adaptation leads to decanalization of the selected traits. By comparing the expression variance between inbred and outbred samples, we found evidence that adaptation may lead to genetic decanalization for expression abundance but not for splicing. Our study reveals the relationship between adaptation, plasticity and canalization in three instances in nature.",

Generating null species occurrences with similar spatial structure to observed data can help overcome these problems, but existing methods focus on single or pairs of species and do not incorporate between-species spatial structure that may occlude comparative biogeographic analyses. Here, we describe an algorithm for generating randomised species occurrence points that mimic the within- and between-species spatial structure of real datasets and implement it in a new R package - fauxcurrence. The algorithm can be implemented on any geographic domain for any number of species, limited only by computing power. To demonstrate its utility, we apply the algorithm to two common analysis-types: testing the fit of species distribution models (SDMs) and evaluating niche-overlap. The method works well on all tested datasets within reasonable timescales. We found that many SDMs, despite a good fit to the data, were not significantly better than null expectations and identified only two cases (out of a possible 32) of significantly higher niche divergence than expected by chance. The package is user-friendly, flexible and has many potential applications beyond those tested here, such as joint SDM evaluation and species co-occurrence analysis, spanning the areas of ecology, evolutionary biology and biogeography.",

The ensemble nature of proteins, for example, challenges the structural prediction methods because the models should represent a set of conformers instead of single structures. The evolutionary and structural features captured by effective deep learning techniques may unveil the information to generate several diverse conformations from a single sequence. Here we address the performance of AlphaFold2 predictions under this ensemble paradigm. Using a curated collection of apo-holo conformations, we found that AlphaFold2 predicts the holo form of a protein in 70% of the cases, being unable to reproduce the observed conformational diversity with an equivalent error than in the estimation of a single conformation. More importantly, we found that AlphaFold2s performance worsens with the increasing conformational diversity of the studied protein. This impairment is related to the heterogeneity in the degree of conformational diversity found between different members of the homologous family of the protein under study. Finally, we found that main-chain flexibility associated with apo-holo pairs of conformers negatively correlates with the predicted local model quality score plDDT, indicating that plDDT values in a single 3D model could be used to infer local conformational changes linked to ligand binding transitions.",

In in vitro slice preparations containing the preBotC, extracellular potassium must be elevated above physiological levels (to 7 - 9 mM) to observe regular rhythmic respiratory motor output in the hypoglossal nerve to which the preBotC projects. Reexamination of how extracellular K+ affects preBotC neuronal activity has revealed that low amplitude oscillations persist at physiological levels. These oscillatory events are sub-threshold from the standpoint of transmission to motor output and are dubbed burstlets. Burstlets arise from synchronized neural activity in a rhythmogenic neuronal subpopulation within the preBotC that in some instances may fail to recruit the larger network events, or bursts, required to generate motor output. The fraction of subthreshold preBotC oscillatory events (burstlet fraction) decreases sigmoidally with increasing extracellular potassium. These observations underlie the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Experimental and computational studies have suggested that recruitment of the non-rhythmogenic component of the preBotC population requires intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and activation of a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current. In this computational study, we show how intracellular calcium dynamics driven by synaptically triggered Ca2+ influx as well as Ca2+ release/uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum in conjunction with a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current can explain all of the key observations underlying the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Thus, we provide a mechanistic basis to unify the experimental findings on rhythm generation and motor output recruitment in the preBotC.",

However, existing methodologies to measure this rate are labor intensive, indirect, and confounded by karyotype selection reducing observable diversity.

Despite its importance in natural and engineered microbial systems, our understanding of how cross-feeding arises is incomplete, with existing theories limited to specific scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel theory for the evolution of cross-feeding, which we term noise-averaging cooperation (NAC). NAC is based on the idea that, due to their small size, bacteria are prone to noisy regulation of metabolism which limits their growth rate. To compensate, related bacteria can share metabolites with each other to \"average out\" noise and improve their collective growth. This metabolite sharing among kin then allows for the evolution of metabolic interdependencies via gene deletions (this can be viewed as a generalization of the Black Queen Hypothesis). We first characterize NAC in a simple model of cell metabolism, showing that metabolite leakage can in principle substantially increase growth rate in a community context. Next, we develop a generalized framework for estimating the potential benefits of NAC among real bacteria. Using single-cell protein abundance data, we predict that bacteria suffer from substantial noise-driven growth inefficiencies, and may therefore benefit from NAC. Finally, we review existing evidence for NAC and outline potential experimental approaches to detect NAC in microbial communities.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Peripheral sensory neurons located in dorsal root ganglia relay sensory information from the peripheral tissue to the brain. Satellite glial cells (SGC) are unique glial cells that form an envelope completely surrounding each sensory neuron soma. This organization allows for close bi-directional communication between the neuron and it surrounding glial coat. Morphological and molecular changes in SGC have been observed in multiple pathological conditions such as inflammation, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, viral infection and nerve injuries. There is evidence that changes in SGC contribute to chronic pain by augmenting neuronal activity in various rodent pain models. SGC also play a critical role in axon regeneration. Whether findings made in rodent model systems are relevant to human physiology have not been investigated. Here we present a detailed characterization of the transcriptional profile of SGC in mouse, rat and human at the single cell level. Our findings suggest that key features of SGC in rodent models are conserved in human. Our study provides the potential to leverage rodent SGC properties and identify potential targets in humans for the treatment of nerve injuries and alleviation of painful conditions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "To generate haploid gametes, cohesin is removed in a step-wise manner from chromosome arms in meiosis I and the centromere region in meiosis II, to segregate chromosomes and sister chromatids, respectively. Meiotic cohesin removal requires cleavage of the meiosis-specific kleisin subunit Rec8 by the protease Separase[1, 2]. In yeast, Rec8 is kept in a non-phosphorylated state by the action of PP2A-B56, which is localised to the centromere region, thereby preventing cohesin removal from this region in meiosis I[3-5]. However, it is unknown whether Rec8 has to be equally phosphorylated for cleavage, and whether centromeric cohesin protection is indeed brought about by dephosphorylation of Rec8 preventing cleavage, in mammalian meiosis. The identity of one or several potential Rec8-specific kinase(s) is also unknown. This is due to technical challenges, as Rec8 is poorly conserved preventing a direct translation of the knowledge gained from model systems such as yeast and C. elegans to mammals, and additionally, there is no turn-over of Rec8 after cohesion establishment, preventing phosphomutant analysis of functional Rec8. To address how Rec8 cleavage is brought about in mammals, we adapted a biosensor for Separase to study Rec8 cleavage in single mouse oocytes by live imaging, and identified phosphorylation sites promoting cleavage. We found that Rec8 cleavage by Separase depends on Aurora B/C kinase activity, and identified a residue promoting cleavage and being phosphorylated in an Aurora B/C kinase-dependent manner. Accordingly, inhibition of Aurora B/C kinase during meiotic maturation impairs endogenous Rec8 phosphorylation and chromosome segregation.",

The population activity within each module is tightly coordinated and preserved across environments and behavioral states. Little is known, however, about the coordination of activity patterns across modules. We analyzed the joint activity patterns of hundreds of grid cells simultaneously recorded in animals that were foraging either in the light, when sensory cues could stabilize the representation, or in darkness, when such stabilization was disrupted. We found that the states of different grid modules are tightly coordinated, even in darkness, when the internal representation of position within the MEC deviates substantially from the true position of the animal. These findings suggest that internal brain mechanisms dynamically coordinate the representation of position in different modules, to ensure that grid cells jointly encode a coherent and smooth trajectory of the animal.",

    "preprint_abstract": "How does the human brain manage multiple bits of information to guide goal-directed behaviour? Successful working memory (WM) functioning has consistently been linked to oscillatory power in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) over fronto-medial cortex (fronto-medial theta, FMT). Specifically, FMT is thought to reflect the mechanism of an executive sub-system that coordinates maintenance of memory contents in posterior regions. However, direct evidence for the role of FMT in controlling specific WM content is lacking. Here we collected high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) data whilst participants engaged in load-varying WM tasks and then used multivariate decoding methods to examine WM content during the maintenance period. Higher WM load elicited a focal increase in FMT. Importantly, decoding of WM content was driven by posterior/parietal sites, which in turn showed load-induced functional theta coupling with fronto-medial cortex. Finally, we observed a significant slowing of FMT frequency with increasing WM load, consistent with the hypothesised broadening of a theta  duty cycle to accommodate additional WM items. Together these findings demonstrate that frontal theta orchestrates posterior maintenance of WM content. Moreover, the observed frequency slowing elucidates the function of FMT oscillations by specifically supporting phase-coding accounts of WM.\n\nSignificance StatementHow does the brain juggle the maintenance of multiple items in working memory (WM)? Here we show that increased WM demands increase theta power (4-8 Hz) in fronto-medial cortex. Interestingly, using a machine learning approach, we found that the content held in WM could be read out not from frontal, but from posterior areas. These areas were in turn functionally coupled with fronto-medial cortex, consistent with the idea that frontal cortex orchestrates WM representations in posterior regions. Finally, we observed that holding an additional item in WM leads to significant slowing of the frontal theta rhythm, supporting computational models that postulate longer  duty cycles to accommodate additional WM demands.",

We wondered whether differentiated cell types might result from intrinsic differences in hiPS cells prior to the onset of differentiation. By associating individual differentiated cells that share a common hiPS cell precursor, we were able to test whether expression variability in differentiated cells was pre-determined from the hiPS cell state. Although within a single experiment, differentiated cells that share an hiPS cell progenitor were more transcriptionally similar to each other than to other cells in the differentiated population, when the same hiPS cells were differentiated in parallel, we did not observe high transcriptional similarity across differentiations. Additionally, we found that substantial cell death occurred during differentiation in a manner that suggested that all cells were equally likely to survive or die, suggesting that there was no intrinsic selection bias for cells descended from particular hiPS cell progenitors. These results led us to wonder about how cells grow out spatially during the directed differentiation process. Labeling cells by their expression of a few canonical cell type marker genes, we showed that cells expressing the same marker tended to occur in patches observable by visual inspection, suggesting that cell type determination across multiple cell types, once initiated, is maintained in a cell-autonomous manner for multiple divisions. Altogether, our results show that while there is substantial heterogeneity in the initial hiPS cell population, that heterogeneity is not responsible for heterogeneous outcomes, and that the window during which cell type specification occurs is likely to begin shortly after the seeding of hiPS cells for differentiation.",

On the other hand, contact-dependent cell-cell signalling is responsible for generating a large variety of intricate, self-organized, spatial patterns of the signalling molecules. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that the combined mechanochemical patterns of cell shape/size and signalling molecules in the tissues, for example, in cancerous and sensory epithelium, are governed by mechanochemical coupling between chemical signalling and cell mechanics. However, a clear quantitative picture of how these two aspects of tissue dynamics, i.e., signalling and mechanics, lead to pattern and form is still emerging. Although, a number of recent experiments demonstrate that cell mechanics, cell motility, and cell-cell signalling are tightly coupled in many morphogenetic processes, relatively few modeling efforts have focused on an integrated approach. We extend the vertex model of an epithelial monolayer to account for contact-dependent signalling between adjacent cells and between non-adjacent neighbors through long protrusional contacts with a feedback mechanism wherein the adhesive strength between adjacent cells is controlled by the expression of the signalling molecules in those cells. Local changes in cell-cell adhesion lead to changes in cell shape and size, which in turn drives changes in the levels of signalling molecules. Our simulations show that even this elementary two-way coupling of chemical signalling and cell mechanics is capable of giving rise to a rich variety of mechanochemical patterns in epithelial tissues. In particular, under certain parametric conditions, bimodal distributions in cell size and shape are obtained, which resemble experimental observations in cancerous and sensory tissues.",

Here, we investigate how the addition of various metal salts to the environment can impact plant-circadian rhythms, via the promoter:luciferase system. The consequences of these environmental changes were found to be varied and complex. Therefore, in addition to Fourier-based analyses, we apply novel wavelet-based spectral hypothesis testing and clustering methodologies to organize and understand the data. We are able to classify broad sets of responses to environmental contaminants, including pollutants which increase, or decrease, the period, or which induce a lack of precision or disrupt any meaningful periodicity.

BesC belongs to the emerging family of O2-activating non-heme-diiron enzymes with the \"heme-oxygenase-like\" protein fold (HDOs). Here we show that binding of L-Lys or an analog triggers capture of O2 by the proteins diiron(II) cofactor to form a blue {micro}-peroxodiiron(III) intermediate analogous to those previously characterized in two other HDOs, the olefin-installing fatty acid decarboxylase, UndA, and the guanidino-N-oxygenase domain of SznF. The [~] 5- and [~] 30-fold faster decay of the intermediate in reactions with 4-thia-L-Lys and (4RS)-chloro-DL-lysine than in the reaction with L-Lys itself, and the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (D-KIEs) on decay of the intermediate and production of L-allylglycine in the reaction with 4,4,5,5-[2H]-L-Lys, imply that the peroxide intermediate or a successor complex with which it reversibly interconverts initiates the oxidative fragmentation by abstracting hydrogen from C4. Surprisingly, the sluggish substrate L-Lys can dissociate after triggering the intermediate to form, thereby allowing one of the better substrates to bind and react. Observed linkage between Fe(II) and substrate binding suggests that the triggering event involves a previously documented (in SznF) ordering of the dynamic HDO architecture that contributes one of the iron sites, a hypothesis consistent with the observation that the diiron(III) product cluster produced upon decay of the intermediate spontaneously degrades, as it has been shown to do in all other HDOs studied to date.",

However, how bacteria dynamically modulate their vast repertoire of adhesins to achieve surface colonization is not yet well-understood. We used experimental evolution and positive selection for improved adhesion to investigate how an initially poorly adherent Escherichia coli strain increased its adhesion capacities to abiotic surfaces. We showed that all identified evolved clones acquired mutations located almost exclusively in the lectin domain of fimH, the gene coding for the -D-mannose-specific tip adhesin of type 1 fimbriae. While most of these fimH mutants showed reduced mannose- binding ability, they all displayed enhanced binding to abiotic surfaces, indicating a trade-off between FimH-mediated specific and non-specific adhesion properties. Several of the identified mutations were already reported in FimH lectin domain of pathogenic and environmental E. coli, suggesting that, beyond patho-adaptation, FimH microevolution favoring non-specific surface adhesion could constitute a selective advantage for natural E. coli isolates. Consistently, although E. coli deleted for the fim operon still evolves an increased adhesion capacity, mutants selected in the {Delta}fim background are outcompeted by fimH mutants revealing clonal interference for adhesion. Our study therefore provides insights into the plasticity of E. coli adhesion potential and shows that evolution of type 1 fimbriae is a major driver of the adaptation of natural E. coli to colonization.",

Development time was extended under polyandry relative to monogamy in both sexes, potentially due to higher investment in traits linked to sexual selection and sexual conflict. Individuals (especially males) evolving under polyandry had higher metabolic rates and locomotor activity than those evolving under monogamy. Polyandry individuals also invested more in metabolites associated with increased endurance capacity and efficient energy metabolism and regulation, namely lipid and glycogen. Finally, polyandry males were less desiccation- and starvation-resistant than monogamy males, suggesting trade-offs between resistance and sexually selected traits.

These patterns showed daily fluctuations even within the same individual spending a usual life. Similar diversities were also observed for the T cell receptor and B cell receptor repertoires. Detailed immune cell profiles at healthy statuses should give an essential background information to understand their immune responses, when the individual is exposed to various environmental conditions. To demonstrate this idea, we conducted the similar analysis for the same individuals on the vaccination of Influenza and SARS-CoV-2, since the date and the dose of the antigens are well-defined in these cases.

Importantly, their increase in fluorescence upon localization enables no-wash live-cell imaging, which greatly facilitates their use in biological assays. Applications as fluorescent indicators in rat hippocampal neurons include the detection of single action potentials and of calcium fluxes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Applications as bioluminescent indicators include the recording of the pharmacological modulation of nuclear calcium in high-throughput-compatible assays. The versatility and remarkable ease of use of these indicators make them powerful tools for bioimaging and bioassays.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/468356v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7aa92org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7141org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@447f30org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa34c2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we describe methods for whole mount visualization of meningeal and choroid plexus fibroblasts, and optical tissue clearing methods for visualization of parenchymal vessel-associated fibroblasts. Importantly, these techniques can be combined with immunohistochemistry methods for labeling different cell types in the meninges and blood vasculature as well as EdU-based cell proliferation assays.

Behavioral inflexibility can prevent adaptive strategies such as mindfulness or other relapse-prevention behaviors. In a mouse model we investigated whether individual variability in behavioral flexibility (using attentional set-shifting task; ASST) predicts future alcohol intake. Adult male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to ASST using a bowl digging paradigm where mice identify a baited bowl based on compound odor and textural cues. This was completed prior to any alcohol exposure. Individual performance across mice varied within the group. We integrated several metrics, specifically ASST stage completed, trials to completion and errors performed to produce an individual performance index measure of behavioral flexibility. After, ASST mice were trained to drink ethanol (15%, v/v, 1hr/day) for 3-4 weeks until intake stabilized. Using this prospective approach, we identified an inverse relationship between behavioral flexibility and drinking - less flexible mice had a propensity to consume more alcohol. Similar relationships have been identified previously in non-human primates and rats. Our results show that the relationship between alcohol and cognitive flexibility is a robust trait that is conserved across species and can be used in mice to study neural substrates underlying these behaviors.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- ASST can be used to examine individual differences in cognitive function in mice\n- Behavioral inflexibility is related to future higher alcohol consumption\n- Executive function can be used as a predictive risk factor for alcohol intake\n- This relationship in mice supports previous findings across species",

In contrast to previous work that suggests the potential for obligate interaction networks to evolve is limited, we find the opposite pattern: natural selection in the form of ecological disturbance favors both specific network topologies and cooperative cross-feeding among community members.

    "preprint_abstract": "A key hypothesis for the occurrence of senescence is a decrease in the selection strength because of low late-life fitness - the so-called selection shadow. However, in social insects, aging is considered a plastic trait and senescence seems to be absent. By life-long tracking of 102 ant colonies, we find that queens increase the production of sexuals in late life regardless of their absolute lifespan or worker investment. This indicates a genetically accommodated adaptive shift towards increasingly queen-biased caste ratios over the course of a queens life. Furthermore, mortality decreased with age, supporting the hypothesis that aging is adaptive. We argue that selection for late life reproduction diminishes the selection shadow of old age and leads to the apparent absence of senescence in ants, in contrast to most iteroparous species.\n\nSignificance StatementSocial insects are extraordinary with regard to the absolute age of queens of some species as well as the age differences between queens and short-lived workers. Yet, ultimate causes explaining these aging patterns remain poorly understood. By manipulating the investment ratio into queens and workers we studied the effect on lifespan and temporal reproductive investment of queens. We show that queens shift to the production of sexuals late in life, independent of social context (colony size) or individual quality (reproductive output and lifespan). Such late fitness gains result in maintenance in the selection strength with age, and thus explains the absence of senescence in queens.",

However, multispecies surveys are prone to various types of observation error, including false positive/negative detection, and misclassification, where a species is encountered but its species identity is not correctly identified. Previous methods assume an imperfect classifier produces species-level classifications, but in practice, particularly with human observers, we may end up with extraspecific classifications including \"unknown\", morphospecies designations, and taxonomic identifications coarser than species. Disregarding these types of species misclassification in biodiversity monitoring datasets can bias estimates of ecologically important quantities such as demographic rates, occurrence, and species richness.\nC_LIO_LIHere we develop an occupancy model that accounts for species non-detection and misclassification. Our framework accommodates extinction and colonization dynamics, allows for additional uncertain  morphospecies designations in the imperfect species classifications, and makes use of individual specimen with known species identities in a semi-supervised setting. We compare the performance of our joint classification-occupancy model to a reduced classification model that discards information about occupancy and encounter rate on a withheld test set. We illustrate our model with an empirical case study of the carabid beetle (Carabidae) community at the National Ecological Observatory Network Niwot Ridge Mountain Research Station, west of Boulder, CO, USA, and quantify taxonomist identification error by accounting for classification probabilities.\nC_LIO_LISpecies occupancy varied through time and across sites and species. The model yielded high probabilities (30 to 92% medians) of classification where the imperfect classifier matched the true species. The classification model informed by occupancy and encounter rates outperformed the classification that was not, and these differences were most pronounced for abundant species.\nC_LIO_LIOur probabilistic framework can be applied to datasets with imperfect species detection and classification. This model can identify commonly misclassified species, helping biodiversity monitoring organizations systematically prioritize which samples need validation by an expert. Our Bayesian approach propagates classification uncertainty to offer an alternative to making conservation decisions based on point estimates\nC_LI",

Here we implemented RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) combined with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-reads to measure differential host gene expression, transcript polyadenylation and isoform usage within various epithelial cell lines permissive and non-permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-infected Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells), Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells), Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cells) and A549 (human lung carcinoma epithelial cells) were analysed over time (0, 2, 24, 48 hours). Differential polyadenylation was found to occur in both infected Calu-3 and Vero cells during a late time point (48 hpi), with Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as viral transcription and translation shown to be significantly enriched in Calu-3 data. Poly(A) tails showed increased lengths in the majority of the differentially polyadenylated transcripts in Calu-3 and Vero cell lines (up to ~136 nt in mean poly(A) length, padj = 0.029). Of these genes, ribosomal protein genes such as RPS4X and RPS6 also showed downregulation in expression levels, suggesting the importance of ribosomal protein genes during infection. Furthermore, differential transcript usage was identified in Caco-2, Calu-3 and Vero cells, including transcripts of genes such as GSDMB and KPNA2, which have previously been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Overall, these results highlight the potential role of differential polyadenylation and transcript usage in host immune response or viral manipulation of host mechanisms during infection, and therefore, showcase the value of long-read sequencing in identifying less-explored host responses to disease.",

For instance, molecular mechanisms and population-level dynamics such as competition and cell-cell variability have been described as playing a key role in the emergence and evolution of cell resistances. Multi-scale models are a useful tool to study biology at a very different time and spatial scales, as they can integrate different processes that take place at the molecular, cellular and intercellular levels. In the present work, we use an extended hybrid multi-scale model of 3T3 fibroblast spheroid to perform a deep exploration of the parameter space of effective treatment strategies based on TNF pulses. To explore the parameter space of effective treatments in different scenarios and conditions, we have developed an HPC-optimized model exploration workflow based on EMEWS. We first studied the effect of the cells spatial distribution in the values of the treatment parameters by optimizing the supply strategies in 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids of different sizes. We later study the robustness of the effective treatments when heterogeneous populations of cells are considered. We found that our model exploration workflow can find effective treatments in all the studied conditions. Our results show that cells spatial geometry, as well as, population variability should be considered when optimizing treatment strategies in order to find robust parameter sets.",

Proximity promotes cooperation when individuals preferentially help nearby partners, and conversely, cooperation drives proximity when individuals move towards more cooperative partners. However, these two causal directions are difficult to distinguish with observational data. Here, we experimentally test if forcing randomly selected pairs of equally familiar female common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) into close spatial proximity promotes the formation of enduring cooperative relationships. Over 114 days, we sampled 682 hours of interactions among 21 females captured from three distant sites to track daily allogrooming rates over time. We compared these rates before, during, and after a one-week period, during which we caged random triads of previously unfamiliar and unrelated vampire bats in close proximity. After the week of close proximity when all bats could again freely associate, the allogrooming rates of pairs forced into proximity increased more than those of the 126 control pairs. This work is the first to experimentally demonstrate the causal effect of repeated interactions on cooperative investments in vampire bats. Future work should determine the relative importance of mere association versus interactions (e.g. reciprocal allogrooming) in shaping social preferences.",

The recent development of real-time fluorescent cell cycle imaging allows us to identify the position and cell cycle status of individual cells within the growing population, giving rise to the notion of a four-dimensional (4D) tumour spheroid. In this work we develop the first stochastic individual-based model (IBM) of a 4D tumour spheroid and show that IBM simulation data qualitatively and quantitatively compare very well with experimental data from a suite of 4D tumour spheroid experiments performed with a primary human melanoma cell line. The IBM provides quantitative information about nutrient availability within the spheroid, which is important because it is very difficult to measure these data in standard tumour spheroid experiments.

There have been many studies conducted across multiple different species regarding coordinating abilities.

However, it is impossible to make firm conclusions about the evolutionary origins of coordinating abilities without a thorough comparative analysis of the existing data.

This study aimed to rectify this by using meta-analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and systematic review to analyse the data already obtained across multiple studies, and to assess the reliability of this data. We found that many studies did not provide the information necessary for meta analysis, or were not comparable enough to other studies to be included in analyses, meaning meta analyses were underpowered or could not be conducted due to low samples of both studies and different species.

Understanding the host range and dissemination trajectories of plasmids is critical for surveillance and prevention of antimicrobial resistance. Identification of plasmid host ranges could be improved using automated pattern detection methods, compared to homology-based methods due to the diversity and genetic plasticity of plasmids. In this study, we developed a method for predicting the host range of plasmids based on the random forest machine learning method. We trained the models with 8,519 plasmids from 359 different bacterial species per taxonomic level, where the models achieved 0.662 and 0.867 Matthews correlation coefficients at the species and order levels, respectively. Our results suggest that despite the diverse nature and genetic plasticity of plasmids, our random forest model can accurately distinguish between plasmid hosts.

Plasmids confer extra genetic capabilities to the host organisms through accessory genes, which can encode antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors. In addition to lateral inheritance, plasmids can be transferred horizontally between bacterial taxa. Therefore, detecting the host range of plasmids is crucial for understanding and predicting the dissemination trajectories of extrachromosomal genes and bacterial evolution, as well as for taking effective counter measures against antimicrobial resistance.",

The issue of trade-offs among traits is of special interest. We used six parthenogenetic rotifer clones previously exposed to different thermal laboratory conditions. Interclonal differences in female body size were examined in common garden conditions. We estimated the population growth rate and strength of the size-to-temperature response across four thermal regimes. We tested hypotheses on the existence of the relationships between (i) thermal acclimation and species body size, (ii) thermal specialization and fitness and (iii) thermal specialization and strength of the temperature-size rule. Positive verification of (i) would make it justifiable to refer the other investigated traits to thermal preference and, further, to thermal specialization. Addressing the issues (ii) and (iii) is our pioneering contribution to the question on the strength of size-to-temperature response as differing across life strategies. We hypothesized that this plastic response may be affected by the level of thermal specialization and that this pattern may be traded off with the temperature-dependent potential for population growth rate. Additionally, we investigated the differences in reproductive strategy (number of eggs laid by a female and female lifetime duration) in one temperature assumed optimal, which acts as an important supplement to the general clonal life strategy. We confirmed that the thermal acclimation of a clone is related to body size, with clones acclimated to higher temperatures being smaller. We also found that warm-acclimated clones have a narrower thermal range (= are more specialized), and that the temperature-size rule is stronger in rotifers acclimated to intermediate thermal conditions than in specialists. Our results contribute into the issue of trade-offs between generalist and specialist strategies, in the context of plastic body size respone to different temperatures.",

However, challenges remain in conventional cryo-FIB/SEM workflows, including milling thick specimens that do not vitrify well, specimens with preferred orientation, low-throughput when milling small and/or low concentration specimens, and cellular specimens that distribute poorly across grid squares. Here we present a general approach we call the  Waffle Method which leverages high-pressure freezing to address these challenges. We illustrate the mitigation of these challenges by applying the Waffle Method and cryo-ET to reveal the macrostructure of the polar tube in microsporidian spores in multiple complementary orientations, which was previously not possible due to preferred orientation of the spores on the grid. We demonstrate the broadness of the Waffle Method by applying it to three additional cellular samples and a single particle sample using a variety of cryo-FIB-milling hardware, with both manual and automated approaches. We also present a unique and critical stress-relief gap designed specifically for waffled lamellae. Additionally, we describe applications of the Waffle Method which are currently being explored. We propose the Waffle Method as a way to achieve many of the advantages of cryo-liftout on the specimen grid while avoiding the long, challenging, and technically-demanding process required for cryo-liftout.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The mammalian epigenome contains thousands of heterochromatin nanodomains (HNDs) marked by di- and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, which have a typical size of 3-10 nucleosomes. However, the (epi)genetic determinants of their location and boundaries are only partly understood. Here, we compare four HND types in mouse embryonic stem cells, that are defined by histone methylases SUV39H1/2 or GLP, transcription factor ADNP or chromatin remodeller ATRX. Based on a novel chromatin hierarchical lattice framework termed ChromHL, we are able to predict HND maps with singe-nucleotide resolution. We find that HND nucleation can be rationalized by DNA sequence specific protein binding to PAX3/9, ADNP and LINE1 repeats. Depending on type of microdomains, boundaries are determined either by CTCF binding sites or by nucleosome-nucleosome and nucleosome-HP1 interactions. Our new framework allows predicting how patterns of H3K9me2/3 and other chromatin nanodomains are established and changed in processes such as cell differentiation.",

PoxtA/OptrA are often encoded on mobile genetic elements, facilitating their rapid spread amongst Gram-positive bacteria. These target protection proteins are thought to confer resistance by binding to the ribosome and dislodging the antibiotics from their binding sites. However, a structural basis for their mechanism of action has been lacking. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of PoxtA in complex with the Enterococcus faecalis 70S ribosome at 2.9-3.1 [A], as well as the complete E. faecalis 70S ribosome at 2.2-2.5 [A]. The structures reveal that PoxtA binds within the ribosomal E-site with its antibiotic resistance domain (ARD) extending towards the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) on the large ribosomal subunit. At its closest point, the ARD of PoxtA is still located >15 [A] from the linezolid and chloramphenicol binding sites, suggesting that drug release is elicited indirectly. Instead, we observe that the ARD of PoxtA perturbs the CCA-end of the P-site tRNA causing it to shift by [~]4 [A] out of the PTC, which correlates with a register shift of one amino acid for the attached nascent polypeptide chain. Given that linezolid and chloramphenicol are context-specific translation elongation inhibitors, we postulate that PoxtA/OptrA confer resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols indirectly by perturbing the P-site tRNA and thereby altering the conformation of the attached nascent chain to disrupt the drug binding site.",

Previously, a number of PTMs have been identified as autoimmune biomarkers in the initiation and progression of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Herein, we have identified the citrullination of glucokinase (GK) as a result of inflammation, triggering autoimmunity and affecting its biological functions. Glucokinase is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes to regulate glycogen synthesis, and in pancreatic beta cells, where it acts as a glucose sensor to initiate glycolysis and insulin signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that glucokinase is citrullinated in inflamed non-obese diabetic (NOD) islets as well as in human GK. Autoantibodies against both native and citrullinated GK arise in both spontaneous human T1D and murine models. Likewise, autoreactive CD4+ T cells to both native and citrullinated glucokinase epitopes are present in the circulation of T1D patients. Finally, citrullination alters GK biologic activity and suppresses glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our studies define glucokinase as a T1D biomarker, providing new insights into altering glucose metabolism, creating neoautoantigens, and better define the broad impact of PTMs on the tissue pathology of T1D.",

Here we report that cells exploit a sphingomyelin-based lysosomal repair pathway that operates independently of ESCRT to reverse potentially lethal membrane damage. Various conditions perturbing organelle integrity trigger a rapid calcium-activated scrambling and cytosolic exposure of sphingomyelin. Subsequent metabolic conversion of sphingomyelin by neutral sphingomyelinases on the cytosolic surface of injured lysosomes promotes their repair, also when ESCRT function is compromised. Conversely, blocking turnover of cytosolic sphingomyelin renders cells more sensitive to lysosome-damaging drugs. Our data indicate that calcium-activated scramblases, sphingomyelin, and neutral sphingomyelinases are core components of a previously unrecognized membrane restoration pathway by which cells preserve the functional integrity of lysosomes.",

In this study, we have elucidated the mechanism of phosphoinositide-driven PDK1 auto-activation. We show that PDK1 trans- autophosphorylation is mediated by a PIP3-mediated face-to-face dimer. We report regulatory motifs in the kinase-PH interdomain linker that allosterically activate PDK1 autophosphorylation via a linker-swapped dimer mechanism. Finally, we show that PDK1 is autoinhibited by its PH domain and that positive cooperativity of PIP3 binding drives switch- like activation of PDK1. Our work implies that the PDK1-mediated activation of effector kinases, including Akt, PKC, Sgk, S6K and RSK, many of whom are not directly regulated by phosphoinositides, is also likely to be dependent on PIP3 or PI(3, 4)P2.",

We find that more than 90% of both bacterial ribosomal subunits are engaged in elongation at any particular time, and that neither of the subunits, in general, continues translation from one open reading frame to the next on a poly-cistronic mRNA. Furthermore, we find that a variety of previously published orthogonal ribosomes, with altered anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences, show significant binding to endogenous mRNAs, with the rate of translation initiation only modestly affected.

    "preprint_abstract": "Whole-genome duplications (WGDs), in which the number of nuclear genome copies is elevated as a result of autopolyploidy or allopolyploidy, are a prominent process of diversification in eukaryotes. The genetic and evolutionary forces that WGD imposes upon cytoplasmic genomes are not well understood, despite the central role that cytonuclear interactions play in eukaryotic function and fitness. Cellular respiration and photosynthesis depend upon successful interaction between the 3000+ nuclear-encoded proteins destined for the mitochondria or plastids and the gene products of cytoplasmic genomes in multi-subunit complexes such as OXPHOS, organellar ribosomes, Photosystems I and II, and Rubisco. Allopolyploids are thus faced with the critical task of coordinating interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes that were inherited from different species. Because cytoplasmic genomes share a more recent history of common descent with the maternal nuclear subgenome than the paternal subgenome, evolutionary \"mismatches\" between the paternal subgenome and the cytoplasmic genomes in allopolyploids might lead to accelerated rates of evolution in the paternal homoeologs of allopolyploids, either through relaxed purifying selection or strong directional selection to rectify these mismatches. We tested this hypothesis in maternal vs. paternal copies of organelle-targeted genes in six allotetraploids: Brachypodium hybridum, Chenopodium quinoa, Coffea arabica, Gossypium hirsutum, Nicotiana tabacum, and Triticum dicoccoides. We report evidence that allopolyploid subgenomes exhibit unequal rates of protein-sequence evolution, but we did not observe global effects of cytonuclear incompatibilities on paternal homoeologs of organelle-targeted genes. Analyses of gene content revealed mixed evidence for whether organelle-targeted genes re-diploidize more rapidly than non-organelle-targeted genes. Together, these global analyses provide insights into the complex evolutionary dynamics of allopolyploids, showing that allopolyploid subgenomes have separate evolutionary trajectories despite sharing the same nucleus, generation time, and ecological context.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARY\n\nWhole genome duplication, in which the size and content of the nuclear genome is instantly doubled, represents one of the most profound forms of mutational change. The consequences of duplication events are equally monumental, especially considering that almost all eukaryotes have undergone whole genome duplications during their evolutionary history. While myriad genetic, cellular, organismal, and ecological effects of whole genome duplications have been extensively documented, relatively little attention has been paid to the diminutive but essential \"other\" genomes present inside the cell, those of chloroplasts and mitochondria. In this study, we compared the evolutionary patterns of >340,000 genes from 23 species to test whether whole genome duplications are associated with genetic mismatches between the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes. We discovered tremendous differences between duplicated copies of nuclear genomes; however, mitochondria-nuclear and chloroplast-nuclear mismatches do not appear to be common following whole genome duplications. Together these genomic data represent the most extensive analysis yet performed on how polyploids maintain the delicate and finely tuned balance between the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes.",

While the human genome encodes more than 800 GPCR genes, only four G-proteins (Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11, and G12/13) are known to couple with GPCRs. It remains unclear how such divergent GPCR information is translated into the downstream G-protein signaling dynamics. To answer this question, we report a live-cell fluorescence imaging system for monitoring GPCR downstream signaling dynamics at the single-cell level. Genetically encoded biosensors for cAMP, Ca2+, RhoA, and ERK were selected as markers for GPCR downstream signaling, and were stably expressed in HeLa cells. GPCR was further transiently overexpressed in the cells. As a proof-of-concept, we visualized GPCR signaling dynamics of 5 dopamine receptors and 12 serotonin receptors, and found heterogeneity between GPCRs and between cells. Even when the same G proteins were known to be coupled, the patterns of dynamics in GPCR downstream signaling, including the signal strength and duration, were substantially distinct among GPCRs. These results suggest the importance of dynamical encoding in GPCR signaling.",

In this study, we showed that mitochondrial activity and distribution play a key role in bestowing cellular functions on both alveolar epithelial cells and mesenchymal myofibroblasts for generating secondary septa to form alveoli. These results suggest that mitochondrial function is tightly regulated to empower cellular machineries in a spatially specific manner. Indeed, such regulation via mitochondria is required for secretion of platelet-derived growth factor from alveolar epithelial cells to influence myofibroblast proliferation and migration. Moreover, mitochondrial function enables myofibroblast migration during alveolar formation. Together, these findings yield novel mechanistic insights into how mitochondria regulate pivotal steps of alveologenesis.

Acetogens are the most efficient known microbes for fixing carbon oxides CO2 and CO. Understanding proteome allocation is important for metabolic engineering as it dictates metabolic fitness. Here, we use absolute proteomics to quantify intracellular concentrations for >1,000 proteins in the model-acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum grown on three gas mixtures. We detect prioritisation of proteome allocation for C1 fixation and significant expression of proteins involved in the production of acetate and ethanol as well as proteins with unclear functions. The data also revealed which isoenzymes are important. Integration of proteomic and metabolic flux data demonstrated that enzymes catalyse high fluxes with high concentrations and high in vivo catalytic rates. We show that flux adjustments were dominantly accompanied with changing enzyme catalytic rates rather than concentrations. Our work serves as a reference dataset and advances systems-level understanding and engineering of acetogens.",

Here we diagnosed two additional cases of fatal RusV-associated meningoencephalitis in a South American coati (Nasua nasua) and a Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) that were detected in a zoological garden with history of prior RusV infections. Both animals showed abnormal movement or unusual behaviour and their brains tested positive for RusV using specific RT-qPCR and RNA in situ hybridization. As previous sequencing of RusV proved to be very challenging, we employed a sophisticated target-specific capture enrichment with specifically designed RNA baits to generate complete RusV genome sequences from both detected encephalitic animals and apparently healthy wild yellow-necked field mice (Apodemus flavicollis). Furthermore, the technique was used to revise three previously published RusV genomes from two encephalitic animals and a wild yellow-necked field mouse. Virus-to-host sequence ratio and thereby sequence coverage improved markedly using the enrichment method as compared to standard procedures. When comparing the newly generated RusV sequences to the previously published RusV genomes, we identified a previously undetected stretch of 309 nucleotides predicted to represent the intergenic region and the sequence encoding the N-terminus of the capsid protein. This indicated that the original RusV sequence was likely incomplete due to misassembly of the genome at a region with an exceptionally high G+C content of >80 mol%, which could not be resolved even by enormous sequencing efforts with standard methods. The updated capsid protein amino acid sequence now resembles those of RuV and ruhugu virus in size and harbours a predicted RNA binding domain that was not encoded in the original RusV genome version. The new sequence data indicate that RusV has the largest overall genome (9,631 nucleotides), intergenic region (290 nucleotides) and capsid protein-encoding sequence (331 codons) within the genus Rubivirus.",

We studied mouse experimental visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani in BALB/c mice using dual RNA-seq to investigate the transcriptional response of host and parasite in liver and spleen. We identified only 4 species-specific parasite expressed genes (SSPEGs; log2FC >1, FDR <0.05) in the infected spleen, and none in the infected liver. For the host transcriptome, we found 789 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2FC >1, FDR <0.05) in the spleen that were common to both infections, with IFN{gamma} signaling and complement and coagulation cascade pathways highly enriched, and an additional 286 and 186 DEGs that were selective to L. donovani and L. infantum infection respectively. Among those, there were network interactions between genes of amino acid metabolism and PPAR signaling in L. donovani infection and increased IL1{beta} and positive regulation of fatty acid transport in L. infantum infection, although no pathway enrichment was observed. In the liver, there were 1939 DEGs in mice infected with either L. infantum or L. donovani in comparison to uninfected mice, and the most enriched pathways were IFN{gamma} signaling, neutrophil mediated immunity, complement and coagulation, cytokine-chemokine responses and hemostasis. Additionally, 221 DEGs were selective in L. donovani and 429 DEGs in L. infantum infections. These data show that the host response for these two visceral leishmaniasis infection models is broadly similar, and [~]10% of host DEGs vary in infections with either parasite species.\n\nImportanceVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by two species of Leishmania parasites, L. donovani in the Old World and L. infantum in the New World and countries bordering the Mediterranean. Although cardinal features such as hepato-splenomegaly and alterations in blood and immune function are evident, clinical presentation may vary by geography, with for example severe bleeding often associated with VL in Brazil. Although animal models of both L. donovani and L. infantum have been widely used to study disease pathogenesis, a direct side-by-side comparison of how these parasites species impact the infected host and/or how they might respond to the stresses of mammalian infection has not been previously reported. Identifying common and distinct pathways to pathogenesis will be important to ensure that new therapeutic or prophylactic approaches will be applicable across all forms of VL.",

Here, we set up an fMRI paradigm in virtual reality (VR) to study whether and how threatening (artificial) body parts affects their self-attribution. Participants (N=30) saw a spider (aversive stimulus) or a toy-car (neutral stimulus) moving along a 3D-rendered virtual forearm positioned like their real forearm, while tactile stimulation was applied on the real arm in the same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) direction. We found that the PPC was more activated during congruent stimulation; higher visual areas and the anterior insula (aIns) showed increased activation during aversive stimulus presentation; and the amygdala was more strongly activated for aversive stimuli when there was stronger multisensory integration of body-related information (interaction of aversiveness and congruency). Together, these findings suggest an enhanced processing of aversive stimuli within the amygdala when they represent a bodily threat.",

Computational repositioning methods, particularly non-black-box methods that can account for and predict a drugs mechanism, may provide great benefit for directing future development. By tuning both data and algorithm to utilize relationships important to drug mechanisms, a computational repositioning algorithm can be trained to both predict and explain mechanistically novel indications.\n\nResultsIn this work, we examined the 123 curated drug mechanism paths found in the drug mechanism database (DrugMechDB) and after identifying the most important relationships, we integrated 18 data sources to produce a heterogeneous knowledge graph, MechRepoNet, capable of capturing the information in these paths. We applied the Rephetio repurposing algorithm to MechRepoNet using only a subset of relationships known to be mechanistic in nature and found adequate predictive ability on an evaluation set with AUROC value of 0.83. The resulting repurposing model allowed us to prioritize paths in our knowledge graph to produce a predicted treatment mechanism. We found that DrugMechDB paths, when present in the network were rated highly among predicted mechanisms. We then demonstrated MechRepoNets ability to use mechanistic insight to identify a drugs mechanistic target, with a mean reciprocal rank of .525 on a test set of known drug-target interactions. Finally, we walked through a repurposing example of the anti-cancer drug imantinib for use in the treatment of asthma, to demonstrate this methods utility in providing mechanistic insight into repurposing predictions it provides.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe Python code to reproduce the entirety of this analysis is available at: https://github.com/SuLab/MechRepoNet\n\nContactasu@scripps.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplemental information is available at Bioinformatics online.",

For a protein sequence, there are many methods to generate a SA.

In this work, we describe a method to predict the quality of a proteins SA.\n\nMethodsWe created our own dataset by generating a variety of SAs for a set of 1,351 representative proteins and investigated various deep learning architectures to predict the local distance difference test (lDDT) scores of distance maps predicted with SAs as the input. These lDDT scores serve as indicators of the quality of the SAs.\n\nResultsUsing two independent test datasets consisting of CASP13 and CASP14 targets, we show that our method is effective for scoring and ranking SAs when a pool of SAs is available for a protein sequence. With an example, we further discuss that SA selection using our method can lead to improved structure prediction.",

Measuring AI in bulk data lacking time or spatial resolution has the limitation that cell-type-specific (CTS), spatial-, or time-dependent AI signals may be dampened or not detected.\n\nResultsWe introduce a statistical method airpart for identifying differential CTS AI from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, or other spatially- or time-resolved datasets. airpart outputs discrete partitions of data, pointing to groups of genes and cells under common mechanisms of cis-genetic regulation. In order to account for low counts in single-cell data, our method uses a Generalized Fused Lasso with Binomial likelihood for partitioning groups of cells by AI signal, and a hierarchical Bayesian model for AI statistical inference. In simulation, airpart accurately detected partitions of cell types by their AI and had lower RMSE of allelic ratio estimates than existing methods. In real data, airpart identified differential AI patterns across cell states and could be used to define trends of AI signal over spatial or time axes.\n\nAvailabilityThe airpart package is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/airpart.",

Cross species conservation is often used to identify such regions but has limited resolution to detect selection on short evolutionary timescales such as that occurring in only one species. In contrast, intolerance looks for depletion of variation relative to expectation within a species, allowing species specific features to be identified. When estimating the intolerance of noncoding sequence methods strongly leverage variant frequency distributions. As the expected distributions depend on demography, if not properly controlled for, ancestral population source may obfuscate signals of selection. We demonstrate that properly incorporating demography in intolerance estimation greatly improved variant classification (13% increase in AUC relative to comparison constraint test, CDTS; and 9% relative to conservation). We provide a genome-wide intolerance map that is conditional on demographic history that is likely to be particularly valuable for variant prioritization.",

The resulting nutrient limitation or restricted access to nutrients pose a major challenge for every organism. While many animals, such as hibernating animals, evolved strategies to overcome periods of nutrient scarcity, the cellular mechanisms of these strategies are poorly understood. Cave environments represent an extreme example of nutrient deprived environments since the lack of sunlight and therefore primary energy production drastically diminishes the nutrient availability. Here, we used Astyanax mexicanus, which includes river-dwelling surface fish and cave adapted cavefish populations to study the genetic adaptation to nutrient limitations. We show that cavefish populations store large amounts of fat in different body regions when fed ad libitum in the lab. We found higher expression of lipogenesis genes in cavefish livers when fed the same amount of food as surface fish, suggesting an improved ability of cavefish to use lipogenesis to convert available energy into triglycerides for storage into adipose tissue. Moreover, the lipid metabolism regulator, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} (Ppar{gamma}), is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in cavefish livers. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) showed that Ppar{gamma} binds cavefish promoter regions of genes to a higher extent than surface fish. Finally, we identified two possible regulatory mechanisms of Ppar{gamma} in cavefish: higher amounts of ligands of the nuclear receptor, and nonsense mutations in per2, a known repressor of Ppar{gamma}. Taken together, our study reveals that upregulated Ppar{gamma} promotes higher levels of lipogenesis in the liver and contributes to higher body fat accumulation in cavefish populations, an important adaptation to nutrient limited environments.",

Autophagy has been implicated in the regulation or execution of regulated cell death processes in a wide range of eukaryotes. However, its function in developmentally controlled programmed cell death (dPCD) in plants remains little studied and controversial. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy in dPCD using the Arabidopsis root cap as an accessible and genetically tractable model system. We show that autophagic flux is induced prior to dPCD execution in both root cap tissues, the columella and the lateral root cap (LRC), and impaired in autophagy-deficient mutants. These mutants show a strongly delayed cell death and an absence of corpse clearance in the columella during and after their shedding into the rhizosphere. However, autophagy deficiency does not affect dPCD execution or corpse clearance in LRC cells at the distal end of the root cap. Our results demonstrate that autophagy promotes dPCD in a highly cell-type specific manner, and present the root cap as a powerful model system to study organ-specific autophagy in vivo.",

For the Drosophila testis we recently showed that pro niche cells, specified at disparate positions during early gonadogenesis, must assemble into one collective at the anterior of the gonad. We now find that Slit and FGF signals emanating from adjacent visceral mesoderm regulate assembly. In response to signaling, niche cells express islet, which we find is also required for niche assembly. Without signaling, niche cells specified furthest from the anterior are unable to migrate, remaining dispersed. Function of such niches is severely disrupted, with niche cells evading cell cycle quiescence, compromised in their ability to signal the incipient stem cell pool, and failing to orient stem cell divisions properly. Our work identifies both extrinsic signaling and intrinsic responses required for proper assembly and placement of the testis niche.",

However, recent studies testify that high TMB levels are only able to stratify ICI responders in a subset of cancer types, where the mechanisms underlying this observation have remained unknown. We hypothesized that the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) may modulate the stratification power of TMB (termed TMB power) in a cancer type, leading to this observation. To systematically study this hypothesis, we analyzed TCGA expression data to infer the levels of 31 immune-related factors characteristic of the TME of different cancer types. We integrated this information with TMB and response data of 2,277 patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 ICI to identify the key immune factors that can determine TMB power across 14 different cancer types. We find that high levels of M1 macrophages and low resting dendritic cells in the TME characterize cancer types with high TMB power. A model based on these two immune factors is strongly predictive of the TMB power in a given cancer type (Spearman Rho=0.76, P<3.6x10-04). Using this model, we provide predictions of the TMB power in nine additional cancer types, including rare cancers, for which TMB and ICI response data are not yet publicly available on a large scale. Our analysis indicates that TMB-High may be highly predictive of ICI response in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that such a study should be prioritized.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Comparative analysis of Clostridioides difficile whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data enables fine scaled investigation of transmission and is increasingly becoming part of routine surveillance. However, these analyses are constrained by the computational requirements of the large volumes of data involved. By decomposing WGS reads or assemblies into k-mers and using the dimensionality reduction technique MinHash, it is possible to rapidly approximate genomic distances without alignment. Here we assessed the performance of MinHash, as implemented by sourmash, in predicting single nucleotide differences between genomes (SNPs) and C. difficile ribotypes (RTs). For a set of 1,905 diverse C. difficile genomes (differing by 0-168,519 SNPs), using sourmash to screen for closely related genomes, at a sensitivity of 100% for pairs [&le;]10 SNPs, sourmash reduced the number of pairs from 1,813,560 overall to 161,934, i.e., by 91%, with a positive predictive value of 32% to correctly identify pairs [&le;]10 SNPs (maximum SNP distance 4,144). At a sensitivity of 95%, pairs were reduced by 94% to 108,266 and PPV increased to 45% (maximum SNP distance 1,009). Increasing the MinHash sketch size above 2000 produced minimal performance improvement. We also explored a MinHash similarity-based ribotype prediction method. Genomes with known ribotypes (n=3,937) were split into a training set (2,937) and test set (1,000) randomly. The training set was used to construct a sourmash index against which genomes from the test set were compared. If the closest 5 genomes in the index had the same ribotype this was taken to predict the searched genomes ribotype. Using our MinHash ribotype index, predicted ribotypes were correct in 780/1000 (78%) genomes, incorrect in 20 (2%), and indeterminant in 200 (20%). Relaxing the classifier to 4/5 closest matches with the same RT improved the correct predictions to 87%. Using MinHash it is possible to subsample C. difficile genome k-mer hashes and use them to approximate small genomic differences within minutes, significantly reducing the search space for further analysis.\n\nImpact statementThe genetic code, or DNA, of bacteria is increasingly used to track how infection spreads and to guide infection control interventions, as similar or identical DNA sequences are expected in samples from pair of individuals related by transmission. While obtaining the DNA sequence for bacteria is increasingly straightforward, comparing thousands or even millions of sequences requires substantial computing power and time using current approaches. Here we describe how a method for summarising sequencing data, MinHash, can be used to rapidly reduce the number of possible close sequence matches in Clostridioides difficile, an important healthcare-associated pathogen. It can also be used to approximate traditional schemes used to classify C. difficile into smaller subgroups in transmission analyses, such as ribotyping.\n\nData summaryThe authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.",

A key point to develop such a strategy is the availability of regulatory sequences controlling the expression of the gene of interest. With the aim of finding apple gene promoters either inducible by the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora (Ea) or moderately constitutive, we focused on polyphenoloxidase genes (PPO). These genes encode oxidative enzymes involved in many physiological processes and have been previously shown to be up-regulated during the Ea infection process. We found ten PPO and two PPO-like sequences in the apple genome and characterized the promoters of MdPPO16 (pPPO16) and MdKFDV02 PPO-like (pKFDV02) for their potential as Ea-inducible and low-constitutive regulatory sequences respectively. Expression levels of reporter genes fused to these promoters and transiently or stably expressed in apple were quantified after various treatments. Unlike pKFDV02 which displayed a variable activity, pPPO16 allowed a fast and strong expression of transgenes in apple following Ea infection in a Type 3 Secretion System dependent manner. Altogether our results indicate that pKFDV02 did not keep its promises as a constitutive and weak promoter whereas pPPO16, the first Ea-inducible promoter cloned from apple, can be a useful component of intragenic strategies to create fire blight resistant apple genotypes.\n\nKey messagepPPO16, the first Ea-inducible promoter cloned from apple, can be a useful component of intragenic strategies to create fire blight resistant apple genotypes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) processes at universities typically assess candidates along three dimensions: research, teaching, and service. In recent years, some have argued for the inclusion of a controversial fourth criterion: collegiality. While collegiality plays a role in the morale and effectiveness of academic departments, it is amorphic and difficult to assess, and could be misused to stifle dissent or enforce homogeneity. Despite this, some institutions have opted to include this additional element in their RPT documents and processes, but it is unknown the extent of this practice and how it varies across institution type and disciplinary units. This study is based on two sets of data: survey data collected as part of a project that explored the publishing decisions of faculty and how these related to perceived importance in RPT processes, and 864 RPT documents collected from 129 universities from the United States and Canada. We analysed these RPT documents to determine the degree to which collegiality and related terms are mentioned, if they are defined, and if and how they may be assessed during the RPT process. Results show that when collegiality and related terms appear in these documents they are most often just briefly mentioned. It is less common for collegiality and related terms to be defined or assessed in RPT documents. Although the terms are mentioned across all types of institutions, there is a statistically significant difference in how prevalent they are at each. Collegiality is more commonly mentioned in the documents of doctoral research-focused universities (60%), than of masters universities and colleges (31%) or baccalaureate colleges (15%). Results from the accompanying survey of faculty also support this finding: individuals from R-Types were more likely to perceive collegiality to be a factor in their RPT processes. We conclude that collegiality likely plays an important role in RPT processes, whether it is explicitly acknowledged in policies and guidelines or not, and point to several strategies in how it might be best incorporated in the assessment of academic careers.",

For these initiatives to be successful, tree seedlings need to be able to survive flooding episodes, with or without shade. We investigated the survival rates and the formation of adventitious roots in the case of four tree species exposed to combinations of different shading and water levels under controlled conditions in a nursery, with artificial rainwater and with peat soils as the medium. The research focused on the following questions (i) whether trees can grow on flooded peat soils; and (ii) which plant traits allow plants to cope with inundation, with or without shade. The four tree species compared (Shorea balangeran, Cratoxylum arborescens, Nephelium lappaceum and Durio zibethinus) include two natural pioneer and two farmer-preferred fruit trees. The experiment used a split-split plot design with 48 treatment combinations and at least 13 tree-level replicates. The study found that S. balangeran and C. arborescens had relatively high survival rates and tolerated saturated condition for 13 weeks, while N. lappaceum and D. zibethinus required non-saturated peat conditions. S. balangeran and C. arborescens developed adventitious roots to adapt to the inundated conditions. D. zibethinus, S. balangeran and N. lappaceum grew best under moderate (30%) shading levels, while C. arborescent grew best in full sunlight.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Epigenetic cell memory allows distinct gene expression patterns to persist in different cell types despite a common genotype. Although different patterns can be maintained by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs), it was proposed that long-term persistence hinges on chromatin state. Here, we study how the dynamics of chromatin state affect memory, and focus on a biologically motivated circuit motif, among histones and DNA modifications, that mediates the action of TFs on gene expression. Memory arises from time-scale separation among three circuits constituent processes: basal erasure, auto and cross-catalysis, and recruited erasure of modifications. When the two latter processes are sufficiently faster than the former, the circuit exhibits bistability and hysteresis, allowing active and repressed gene states to coexist and persist after TF stimulus removal. The duration of memory is stochastic with a mean value that increases as time-scale separation increases, but more so for the repressed state. This asymmetry stems from the cross-catalysis between repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation and is enhanced by the relatively slower decay rate of the latter. Nevertheless, TF-mediated positive autoregulation can rebalance this asymmetry and even confers robustness of active states to repressive stimuli. More generally, by wiring positively autoregulated chromatin modification circuits under time scale separation, long-term distinct gene expression patterns arise, which are also robust to failure in the regulatory links.",

We developed a biochemical-isotopic model of methanogenesis by CO2 reduction, which predicts carbon and hydrogen isotopic fractionations, and clumped isotopologue distributions, as functions of the cells environment. We mechanistically explain multiple-isotopic patterns in laboratory and natural settings and show that such patterns constrain the in-situ energetics of methanogenesis. Combining our model with environmental data, we infer that in almost all marine environments and gas deposits, energy-limited methanogenesis operates close to chemical and isotopic equilibrium.",

Utilizing transcriptomics, proteomics and genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays, we unravel distinct molecular trajectories which govern the two processes. Notably, iMPC reprogramming is characterized by gradual upregulation of stem and progenitor cell markers, unique signaling pathways, chromatin remodelers and cell cycle regulators which manifest via rewiring of the chromatin in core myogenic promoters. Furthermore, we determine that only iMPC reprogramming is mediated by Notch pathway activation, which is indispensable for iMPC formation and self-renewal. Collectively, this study charts divergent molecular blueprints for myogenic transdifferentiation or reprogramming and underpins the heightened capacity of iMPCs in capturing myogenesis ex vivo.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Coccidioides spp. are mammalian fungal pathogens endemic to the southwestern US and other desert regions of Mexico, central and South America, with the bulk of US infections occurring in California and Arizona. In the soil, Coccidioides grows in a hyphal form that differentiates into 3-5 micron asexual spores (arthroconidia). When arthroconidia are inhaled by mammals they undergo a unique developmental transition from polar hyphal growth to isotropic expansion with multiple rounds of nuclear division, prior to segmentation, forming large spherules filled with endospores. Very little is understood about the molecular basis of spherule formation. Here we characterize the role of the conserved transcription factor Ryp1 in Coccidioides development. We show that Coccidioides {Delta}ryp1 mutants have altered colony morphology under hypha-promoting conditions and are unable to form mature spherules under spherule-promoting conditions. We analyze the transcriptional profile of wild-type and {Delta}ryp1 mutant cells under hypha- and spherule-promoting conditions, thereby defining a set of hypha- or spherule-enriched transcripts (\"morphology-regulated\" genes) that are dependent on Ryp1 for their expression. Forty percent of morphology-regulated expression is Ryp1-dependent, indicating that Ryp1 plays a dual role in both hyphal and spherule development. Ryp1-dependent transcripts include key virulence factors such as SOWgp, which encodes the spherule outer wall glycoprotein. Concordant with its role in spherule development, we find that the {Delta}ryp1 mutant is completely avirulent in the mouse model of coccidioidomycosis, indicating that Ryp1-dependent pathways are essential for the ability of Coccidioides to cause disease. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with live {Delta}ryp1 spores does not provide any protection from lethal C. posadasii intranasal infection, consistent with our findings that the {Delta}ryp1 mutant fails to make mature spherules and likely does not express key antigens required for effective vaccination. Taken together, this work identifies the first transcription factor that drives mature spherulation and virulence in Coccidioides.\n\nAuthor SummaryCoccidioides species, C. immitis and C. posadasii, are dimorphic fungal pathogens that commonly infect humans in North, Central, and South America, causing the respiratory fungal disease known as Valley Fever. Coccidioides grows as hyphae in the soil and differentiates into unique structures called spherules in the mammalian host. Spherules expand and internally divide to form endospores, which are released to facilitate dissemination of the pathogen within the host. The mechanisms underlying spherule differentiation remain largely unknown. In this study, we generated knockout mutants ({Delta}ryp1) of the conserved transcription factor Ryp1 in C. posadasii and characterized its role in spherule formation and virulence. We found that Ryp1 is required for the formation of mature spherules and colonization of mouse lungs. Transcriptional profiling of the {Delta}ryp1 mutant and the wild-type strain shows that Ryp1 regulates the expression of a subset of the transcripts that are either upregulated in wild-type spherules or in wild-type hyphae. These findings suggest that Ryp1 has a dual role in regulating morphology and virulence under host conditions as well as regulating genes involved in hyphal growth in the environment.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Premelanosome protein (pmel) is a key gene for melanogenesis in vertebrates. Mutations in this gene are responsible for white plumage in chicken, but its role in pigmentation of fish remains to be demonstrated. In this study we found that most fishes have two pmel genes arising from the teleost-specific whole genome duplication. Both pmela and pmelb were expressed at high levels in the eyes and skin of Nile tilapia. We mutated both genes in tilapia using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Homozygous mutation of pmela resulted in yellowish body color with weak vertical bars and a hypo-pigmented retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to significantly reduced number and size of melanophores. In contrast, we observed an increased number and size of xanthophores in mutants compared to wild-type fish. Homozygous mutation of pmelb resulted in a similar, but milder phenotype than pmela-/- mutants, without effects on RPE pigmentation. Double mutation of pmela and pmelb resulted in loss of additional melanophores compared to the pmela-/- mutants, and also an increase in the number and size of xanthophores, producing a strong golden body color without bars in the trunk. The RPE pigmentation of pmela-/-;pmelb-/- was similar to pmela-/- mutants, with much less pigmentation than pmelb-/- mutants and wild-type fish. Taken together, our results indicate that, while both pmel genes are important for the formation of body color in tilapia, pmela plays a more important role than pmelb. To our knowledge, this is the first report on mutation of pmelb or both pmela;pmelb in fish. Studies on these mutants suggest new strategies for breeding golden tilapia, and also provide a new model for studies of pmel function in vertebrates.\n\nAuthor SummaryMelanophores, the most common pigment cell type, have been studied for nearly 150 years. Many genes are involved in melanoblast migration, melanophore differentiation, and melanin biosynthesis. Pmel is fundamental for melanosome development by directing melanin biosynthesis and melanosome phase transition. Specifically, PMEL can form a fibrillar structure within the melanosome upon which melanin is deposited. We identified two pmel genes in Nile tilapia arising from the teleost-specific whole genome duplication. Disruption of either pmela or pmelb in tilapia leads to significant hypo-pigmentation. PMEL disrupted fish showed not only a reduction in melanin and tiny melanophores, but also a significant increase in the number of xanthophores, and even guanine-filled melanophores, which led to a golden tilapia with hypo-pigmented RPE. Our study confirmed the role of pmel in melanin biosynthesis and maturation, and also highlighted its effects on melanophore number and size. These results provide new insights into pigment cell biology and will help us better understand the mechanisms of color patterning in teleosts. Knockout of both pmela and pmelb provide a new strategy for engineering a golden tilapia, which might provide a foundation for developing new strains in the tilapia industry.",

RB chemotherapy resistance has been studied in different cell culture models such as WERI RB1. In addition, chemotherapy resistant RB subclones like the etoposide resistant WERI ETOR cell line have been established to improve the understanding of chemotherapy resistance in RB. The objective of this study was to characterize cell line models of an etoposide sensitive WERI RB1 and its etoposide resistant subclone WERI ETOR by proteomic analysis. Subsequently, quantitative proteomic data served for correlation analysis with known drug perturbation profiles. Methodically, WERI RB1 and WERI ETOR were cultured and prepared for quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). This was carried out in a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode (Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical Mass Spectra, SWATH-MS). The raw SWATH files were processed using neural networks in a library free mode along with machine learning algorithms. Pathway enrichment was performed using the REACTOME pathway resource and correlated to the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collections for functional annotation. Furthermore, a drug connectivity analysis using the L1000 database was used to correlate the mechanism-of-action (MOA) for different anticancer reagents to WERI RB1/WERI ETOR signatures. A total of 4,756 proteins were identified across all samples, showing a distinct clustering between the groups. Of these proteins, 64 were significantly altered (q < 0.05 & log2FC |>2|, 22% higher in WERI ETOR). Pathway analysis revealed an enriched metabolic pathway for \"retinoid metabolism and transport\" in WERI ETOR and for \"sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis\" in WERI RB1. In addition, this study revealed similar protein signatures of topoisomerase inhibitors in WERI ETOR as well as ATPase inhibitors, acetylcholine receptor antagonists and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors in WERI RB1. In this study, WERI RB1 and WERI ETOR were analyzed as a cell line model for chemotherapy resistance in RB using data-independent MS. The global proteome identified activation of \"sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis\" in WERI RB1 and revealed future potential treatment options for etoposide resistance in RB.",

Here, we analyzed Mass Spectrometry HLA-II peptidomics data and identified 1,113 unique phosphorylated HLA-II ligands. This enabled us to precisely define phosphorylated binding motifs for more than 30 common HLA-II alleles and to explore various molecular properties of phosphorylated peptides.

    "preprint_abstract": "Mapping the human connectome using fiber-tracking permits the study of brain connectivity and yields new insights into neuroscience. However, reliable connectome reconstruction using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data acquired by widely available clinical protocols remains challenging, thus limiting the connectome / tractography clinical applications. Here we develop fiber orientation distribution (FOD) network (FOD-Net), a deep-learning-based framework for FOD angular super-resolution. Our method enhances the angular resolution of FOD images computed from common clinical-quality dMRI data, to obtain FODs with quality comparable to those produced from advanced research scanners. Super-resolved FOD images enable superior tractography and structural connectome reconstruction from clinical protocols. The method was trained and tested with high-quality data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and further validated with a local clinical 3.0T scanner. Using this method, we improve the angular resolution of FOD images acquired with typical single-shell low-angular-resolution dMRI data (e.g., 32 directions, b = 1000 s/mm2) to approximate the quality of FODs derived from time-consuming, multi-shell high-angular-resolution dMRI research protocols. We also demonstrate tractography improvement, removing spurious connections and bridging missing connections. We further demonstrate that connectomes reconstructed by super-resolved FODs achieve comparable results to those obtained with more advanced dMRI acquisition protocols, on both HCP and clinical 3.0T data. Advances in deep-learning approaches used in FOD-Net facilitate the generation of high quality tractography / connectome analysis from existing clinical MRI environments.

In this study, we used phototrophic oxic-anoxic micro-ecosystems to understand how the functioning and diversity of aerobic and anaerobic lake analog communities is affected by light deprivation. Continuous measurements were performed to describe oxygen dynamics (mean/min/max/amplitude) and time-series of full-length 16S rRNA sequencing were used to quantify changes in alpha- and beta-diversity. In the top oxic layer, oxygen concentration decreased significantly under light deprivation, but showed resilience in mean, minimum and maximum after light conditions were restored. Only the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations in oxygen concentrations did not recover fully, and instead tended to remain lower in treated ecosystems. Alpha-diversity of the top oxic layer communities showed a delayed increase after light conditions were restored, and was not resilient. In contrast, alpha-diversity of the anoxic bottom layer communities increased due to the stressor, but was resilient. Community composition changed significantly during light deprivation, showed resilience in the oxic layer and lack of resilience in the anoxic layer. Alpha-diversity and the amplitude of oxygen within and among treatments were strongly correlated, suggesting that higher diversity could lead to less variable oxygen concentrations, or vice versa. Our experiment showed that light deprivation induces multifaceted responses of community function and structure, hence focusing on a single stability component could potentially be misleading.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Symbiotic bacteria often navigate complex environments before colonizing privileged sites in their host organism. Chemical gradients are known to facilitate directional taxis of these bacteria, guiding them towards their eventual destination. However, less is known about the role of physical features in shaping the path the bacteria take and defining how they traverse a given space. The flagellated marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri,which forms a binary symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, must navigate tight physical confinement, squeezing through a bottleneck constricting to ~2 m in width on the way to its eventual home. Using microfluidic in vitro experiments, we discovered that V. fischeri cells alter their behavior upon entry into confined space, straightening their swimming paths and promoting escape from confinement. Using a computational model, we attributed this escape response to two factors: reduced directional fluctuation and a refractory period between reversals. Additional experiments in asymmetric capillary tubes confirmed that V. fischeri quickly escape from tapered ends, even when drawn into the ends by chemoattraction. This avoidance was apparent down to a limit of confinement approaching the diameter of the cell itself, resulting in a balance between chemoattraction and evasion of physical confinement. Our findings demonstrate that non-trivial distributions of swimming bacteria can emerge from simple physical gradients in the level of confinement. Tight spaces may serve as an additional, crucial cue for bacteria while they navigate complex environments to enter specific habitats.\n\nSignificance StatementSymbiotic bacteria that navigate to and through specific host tissues often face tight physical confinement. This work reveals that confinement-associated changes in swimming can dramatically alter taxis, shaping bacterial localization in conjuncture with other motility-directing cues. This work helps explain how bacteria can avoid getting stuck in confined areas while transiting to privileged spaces, adding confinement as an environmental cue that symbiotic bacteria use to shape their motility behavior.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In this study, we determined the effect(s) of shearing on Australian Merino ewes (Ovis aries). To test this research question, we used a suite of field and laboratory methods including GPS collars, wool cortisol and novel epigenetic markers identified using Illumina NovaSeq RRBS. Single shorn ewes (n =24) kept on their full fleece throughout the entire gestation period while twice shorn ewes (n =24) had their wool shorn early in gestation. We have discovered one locus (Chr20:50404014) which was significantly associated with different shearing treatments (twice or single shorn ewes), (FDR = 0.005). This locus is upstream of a protein coding gene (ENSOARG00000002778.1), which shows similarities to the forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) mRNA using BLAST searches. We discovered that 36 gene loci were significantly modulated either between different shearing treatments or late vs early pregnancy ewes. Similarly, in lambs we identified 16 annotated gene loci that were significant between late vs early pregnancy. Early shorn ewes grazed 10% higher and maintained stronger body condition. Wool cortisol levels were significantly lower in the early shorn ewes during mid- and late gestation. Lambs bred from twice shorn ewes had on average better visual wool quality parameters in terms of micron, spin finesses and curvature. Collectively, this research provides a new dataset combining physiological, molecular epigenetics and digital tracking indices that advances our understanding of how Merino ewes respond to shearing frequency and this information could guide further research on sheep breeding and welfare.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study provides novel data on the molecular epigenetic signatures in Merino sheep under exposure to natural environmental and management factors. We have discovered DNA methylation profiles from ewes and lambs that are directly associated with whole- animal physiology, development and growth. The baseline data can provide a useful resource for future research in many key areas such as animal welfare, diseases and climatic resilience that will benefit sheep and wool production.",

Little is known about the impact of pharmacologically induced weight loss on distinct gut microbiome species and their respective gene programs in obese individuals.\n\nResultsUsing shotgun metagenomics, the composition of the microbiome was obtained for two cohorts of obese female Wistar rats (n=10-12, total of 82) maintained on a high fat diet before and after a 42-day treatment with a panel of four investigatory or approved anti-obesity drugs (tacrolimus/FK506, bupropion, naltrexone and sibutramine), alone or in combination. We found that sibutramine treatment induced consistent weight loss through reducing food intake. Decreased weight loss in sibutramine-treated rats was associated with changes to the gut microbiome that included increased beta-diversity, increased Bacteroides/Firmicutes ratio and increased relative abundance of multiple Bacteroides species. In addition, the relative abundance of multiple genes was found to be differentially abundant, including significant reductions in components of flagellum and genes involved in flagellum assembly.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides a large resource comprising complete shotgun metagenomics datasets of the fecal microbiome coupled with weight change and food intake at day 3, day 15 and day 42 from 82 obese rats treated with a range of compounds used for weight loss, which are available to the community for detailed analysis. Furthermore, by conducting a detailed analysis of the microbiome associated with sibutramine-induced weight loss, we have identified multiple weight-loss associated microbial taxa and pathways. These include a reduction in components of flagellum and the flagellum assembly pathway that points to a potential role of sibutramine-induced weight-loss on regulating bacterially driven anti-inflammatory responses.",

For efficient upstream development parallel cultivation systems have proven to reduce costs and associated timelines successfully, while offering excellent process control. However, the degree of automation of such small scale systems is comparably low and necessary sample analysis requires manual steps. Although the subsequent analysis can be performed in a high-throughput manner, the integration of analytic devices remains challenging. Especially, when cultivation and analysis laboratories are spatially separated. Mobile robots offer a potential solution, but the implementation in research laboratories is not widely adopted. Our approach demonstrates the integration of a small scale cultivation system into a liquid handling station for an automated sample procedure. The samples are transferred via a mobile robotic lab assistant and subsequently analysed by a high-throughput analyzer. The process data is stored in a centralized database. The mobile robotic workflow guarantees a flexible solution for device integration and facilitates automation. Restrictions regarding spatial separation of devices are circumvented, enabling a modular platform throughout different laboratories. The presented cultivation platform is evaluated based on industrial relevant E. coli BW25113 high cell density fed-batch cultivation. Here its suitability for accelerating bioprocess development is proven. The necessary magnesium addition for reaching high cell densities in mineral salt medium is automated via a feedback operation loop. The feedback operation loop demonstrates the possibility for advanced control options. This study sets the foundation for a fully integrated facility with different cultivation scales sharing the same data infrastructure, where the mobile robotic lab assistant physically connects the devices.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Muscular co-contraction of antagonistic muscle pairs is often observed in human movement, but it is considered inefficient and it can currently not be predicted in simulations where muscular effort or metabolic energy is minimized. Here, we investigated the relationship between minimizing effort and muscular co-contraction in systems with random uncertainty to see if muscular co-contraction can minimize effort in such system. We also investigated the effect of time delay in the muscle, by varying the time delay in the neural control as well as the activation time constant. We solved optimal control problems for a one-degree-of-freedom pendulum actuated by two identical antagonistic muscles, using forward shooting, to find controller parameters that minimized muscular effort while the pendulum remained upright in the presence of noise added to the moment at the base of the pendulum. We compared a controller with and without feedforward control. Task precision was defined by bounding the root mean square deviation from the upright position, while different perturbation levels defined task difficulty. We found that effort was minimized when the feedforward control was nonzero, even when feedforward control was not necessary to perform the task, which indicates that co-contraction can minimize effort in systems with uncertainty. We also found that the optimal level of co-contraction increased with time delay, both when the activation time constant was increased and when neural time delay was added. Furthermore, we found that for controllers with a neural time delay, a different trajectory was optimal for a controller with feedforward control than for one without, which indicates that simulation trajectories are dependent on the controller architecture. Future movement predictions should therefore account for uncertainty in dynamics and control, and carefully choose the controller architecture. The ability of models to predict co-contraction from effort or energy minimization has important clinical and sports applications. If co-contraction is undesirable, one should aim to remove the cause of co-contraction rather than the co-contraction itself.",

A two-shell diffusion MRI scan of the five phantoms in water was performed at 9.4T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), the ball and stick model, neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI), and Bingham-NODDI were all fit to the resulting diffusion MRI data. A fiducial in each phantom was used to register a ground truth map of that phantoms crossing angles and/or arc radius to the diffusion-weighted images. Metrics from each model and representation were compared to the ground-truth maps, and a quadratic regression model was fit to each combination of output metric and ground-truth metric.\n\nResultsThe mean diffusivity (MD) metric defined by DTI was insensitive to crossing angle, but increased with fibre curvature. Axial diffusivity (AD) decreased sharply with increasing crossing angle. DKIs diffusivity metrics replicated the trends seen in DTI, and its mean kurtosis (MK) metric, decreased with fibre curvature, except in regions with high crossing angles. The estimated stick volume fraction in the ball and stick model decreased with increasing fibre curvature and crossing angle. NODDIs intra-neurite volume fraction was insensitive to crossing angle, and its orientation dispersion index (ODI) was strongly correlated to crossing angle. Bingham-NODDIs intra-neurite volume fraction was also insensitive to crossing angle, while its primary ODI (ODIP) was also strongly correlated to crossing angle and its secondary ODI (ODIS) was insensitive to crossing angle. For both NODDI models, the volume fractions of the extra-neurite and CSF compartments had low reliability with no clear relationship to crossing angle.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that inexpensive 3D-printed axon-mimetic phantoms can be used to investigate the effect of fibre curvature and crossings on diffusion MRI representations and models of diffusion signal. As a proof of concept, the dependence of several representations and models on fibre dispersion/crossing were investigated. As expected, Bingham-NODDI was best able to characterize planar fibre dispersion in the phantoms.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Reproductive proteins mediating fertilization commonly exhibit rapid sequence diversification driven by positive selection. This pattern has been observed among nearly all taxonomic groups, including mammals, invertebrates, and plants, and is remarkable given the essential nature of the molecular interactions mediating fertilization. Gene duplication is another iimportant mechanism that facilitates the generation of molecular novelty. Following duplication, paralogs may parse ancestral gene function (subfunctionalization) or acquire new roles (neofunctionalization). However, the contributions of duplication followed by sequence diversification to the molecular diversity of gamete recognition genes has been understudied in many models of fertilization. The marine gastropod mollusk abalone is a classic model for fertilization. Its two acrosomal proteins (lysin and sp18) are ancient gene duplicates with unique gamete recognition functions. Through detailed genomic and bioinformatic analyses we show how duplication events followed by sequence diversification has played an ongoing role in the evolution of abalone acrosomal proteins. The common ancestor of abalone had four members of its acrosomal protein family in a tandem gene array that repeatedly experienced positive selection. We find that both sp18 paralogs contain positively selected sites located in different regions of the paralogs, consistent with a subfunctionalization model where selection acted upon distinct binding interfaces in each paralog. Further, a more recent species-specific duplication of both lysin and sp18 in the European abalone H. tuberculata is described. Despite clade-specific acrosomal protein paralogs, there are no concomitant duplications of egg coat proteins in H. tuberculata, indicating that duplication of egg proteins per se is not responsible for retention of duplicated acrosomal proteins. We hypothesize that, in a manner analogous to host/pathogen evolution, sperm proteins are selected for increased diversity through extensive sequence divergence and recurrent duplication driven by conflict mechanisms.",

Several songbird species have been shown to breed poorly in traffic noise exposed habitats. However, identifying whether noise is causal in this requires experimental approaches. We tested whether experimental exposure to chronic traffic noise affected parental behaviour and reproductive success in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). In a counterbalanced repeated-measures design, breeding pairs were exposed to continuous playback of one of two types of highway noise previously shown to be either neutral (control) or aversive. Parental nest attendance positively correlated with feeding effort and was higher for the aversive than the control sound and this effect was more pronounced for parents attending larger broods. However, neither noise condition affected offspring number, growth or body mass. The absence of an effect held when we combined our data with data from two other comparable studies into a meta-analysis. We discuss whether the increased nest attendance could be a compensatory strategy that alleviated detrimental noise effects on the chicks, and whether it could be caused by impaired parent-offspring or within-pair communication. Future work should test these hypotheses and investigate potential long-term costs of increased parental engagement.",

We find activation of NFkB and dynamic expression of NFkB-associated genes in MG after damage, however NFkB activity is inhibited by microglia ablation. Knockout of NFkB in MG suppressed the accumulation of immune cells after damage. Inhibition of NFkB following NMDA-damage significantly enhanced the reprogramming of Ascl1-overexpressing MG into neuron-like cells. scRNA-seq of retinal glia following inhibition of NFkB reveals coordination with signaling via TGF{beta}2 and suppression of NFI and Id transcription factors. Inhibition of Smad3 or Id transcription factors increased numbers of neuron-like cells produced by Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that NFkB is a key signaling hub that is activated in MG after damage, mediates the accumulation of immune cells, and suppresses the neurogenic potential of MG.",

Specimens introduced into SPECTRA-tube are dried in glass fiber membranes, which are critical for efficient liquid-state sample recovery by rehydration and centrifugation. Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm)-spiked mock sputum dried in native Standard 17 glass fiber was stable for molecular testing after 10-day storage at 45{degrees}C, and for culture testing after 10- and 5-day storage at 37{degrees}C and 45{degrees}C, respectively. Compatibility with human sputum storage was demonstrated by dry storing Mycobacterium bovis-spiked pooled human sputum in SPECTRA-tube for 5 days at room temperature followed by successful qPCR detection. By significantly increasing the volume of samples that can be transported in the dry state and enabling recovery of the entire sample in liquid state, SPECTRA-tube presents a potential universal solution for the preservation and transportation of liquid specimens.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Electrophysiological power spectra typically consist of two components: An aperiodic part usually following an 1/f power law P{propto}1/f{beta}and periodic components appearing as spectral peaks. While the investigation of the periodic parts, commonly referred to as neural oscillations, has received considerable attention, the study of the aperiodic part has only recently gained more interest. The periodic part is usually quantified by center frequencies, powers, and bandwidths, while the aperiodic part is parameterized by the y-intercept and the 1/f exponent {beta}. For investigation of either part, however, it is essential to separate the two components.\n\nIn this article, we scrutinize two frequently used methods, FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations & One-Over-F) and IRASA (Irregular Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis), that are commonly used to separate the periodic from the aperiodic component. We evaluate these methods using diverse spectra obtained with electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and local field potential (LFP) recordings relating to three independent research datasets. Each method and each dataset poses distinct challenges for the extraction of both spectral parts. The specific spectral features hindering the periodic and aperiodic separation are highlighted by simulations of power spectra emphasizing these features. Through comparison with the simulation parameters defined a priori, the parameterization error of each method is quantified. Based on the real and simulated power spectra, we evaluate the advantages of both methods, discuss common challenges, note which spectral features impede the separation, assess the computational costs, and propose recommendations on how to use them.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) occurs due to inability of the body to produce sufficient amount of insulin to regulate blood glucose level (BGL) at normoglycemic range between 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L. Thus, T1DM patients require to do self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) via finger pricks and depend on exogenous insulin injection to maintain their BGL which is very painful and exasperating. Ongoing works on artificial pancreas device nowadays focus primarily on a computer algorithm which is programmed into the controller device. This study aims to simulate so-called improved equations from the Hovorka model using actual patients data through in-silico works and compare its findings with the clinical works.\n\nMethodsThe study mainly focuses on computer simulation in MATLAB using improved Hovorka equations in order to control the BGL in T1DM. The improved equations can be found in three subsystems namely; glucose, insulin and insulin action subsystems. CHO intakes were varied during breakfast, lunch and dinner times for three consecutive days. Simulated data are compared with the actual patients data from the clinical works.\n\nResultsResult revealed that when the patient took 36.0g CHO during breakfast and lunch, the insulin administered was 0.1U/min in order to maintain the blood glucose level (BGL) in the safe range after meal; while during dinner time, 0.083U/min to 0.1 U/min of insulins were administered in order to regulate 45.0g CHO taken during meal. The basal insulin was also injected at 0.066U/min upon waking up time in the early morning. The BGL was able to remain at normal range after each meal during in-silico works compared to clinical works.\n\nConclusionsThis study proved that the improved Hovorka equations via in-silico works can be employed to model the effect of meal disruptions on T1DM patients, as it demonstrated better control as compared to the clinical works.",

Valence, an affective response to images, has not yet been tested in non-priming response time (RT) or temporal order judgement (TOJ) tasks. This study aims to investigate both semantic congruency and valence of non-speech audiovisual stimuli on multisensory integration via RT and TOJ tasks (assessing processing speed (RT), point of subjective simultaneity (PSS), and time-window when multisensory stimuli are likely to be perceived as simultaneous (Temporal Binding Window; TBW)). Forty participants (mean age: 26.25; females=17) were recruited from Prolific Academic resulting in 37 complete datasets. Both congruence and valence have a significant main effect on RT (congruent and high valence decrease RT) as well as an interaction effect (congruent/high valence condition being significantly faster than all others). For TOJ, images high in valence require visual stimuli to be presented significantly earlier than auditory stimuli in order for the audio and visual stimuli to be perceived as simultaneous. Further, a significant interaction effect of congruence and valence on the PSS revealed that the congruent/high valence condition was significantly earlier than all other conditions. A subsequent analysis shows there is a positive correlation between the TBW width (b-values) and RT (as the TBW widens, the RT increases) for the categories that differed most from 0 in their PSS (Congruent/High and Incongruent/Low). This study provides new evidence that supports previous research on semantic congruency and presents a novel incorporation of valence into behavioural responses.",

We designed and developed the AutoClass model, integrating two deep neural network components, an autoencoder and a classifier, as to maximize both noise removal and signal retention. AutoClass is free of distribution assumptions, hence can effectively clean a wide range of noises and artifacts. AutoClass outperforms the state-of-art methods in multiple types of scRNA-Seq data analyses, including data recovery, differential expression analysis, clustering analysis and batch effect removal. Importantly, AutoClass is robust on key hyperparameter settings including bottleneck layer size, pre-clustering number and classifier weight.

Microbial communities are responsible for these processes, but our knowledge of their diversity and function is still poor, partly due to the lack of good reference databases and comprehensive global studies. Here, we sequenced more than 5 million high-quality, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences from 740 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across the world and used the sequences to construct MiDAS 4, a full-length amplicon sequence variant resolved 16S rRNA gene reference database with a comprehensive taxonomy from the domain to species-level for all references. Using a study-independent amplicon dataset from the Global Water Microbiome Consortium project (269 WWTPs), we showed that the MiDAS 4 database provides much better coverage for bacteria in WWTPs worldwide compared to commonly applied universal references databases, and greatly improved the rate of genus and species-level classification. Hence, MiDAS 4 provides a unifying taxonomy for the majority of prokaryotic diversity in WWTPs globally, which can be used for linking microbial identities with their functions across studies. Taking advantage of MiDAS 4, we carried out an amplicon-based, global-scale microbial community profiling of activated sludge plants using two common sets of primers targeting the V1-V3 and V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that the V1-V3 primers were generally best suited for this ecosystem, and revealed how environmental conditions and biogeography shape the activated sludge microbiota. We also identified process-critical taxa (core and conditionally rare or abundant taxa), encompassing 966 genera and 1530 species. These represented approximately 80% and 50% of the accumulated read abundance, respectively, and represent targets for further investigations. Finally, we showed that for well-studied functional guilds, such as nitrifiers or polyphosphate accumulating organisms, the same genera were prevalent worldwide, with only a few abundant species in each genus.",

Many theories hinge on the integration of self-motion signals and the existence of continuous attractor networks (CAN). CAN models hypothesise that neurons coding for navigational correlates - such as position and direction - receive inputs from cells conjunctively coding for position, direction and self-motion. As yet, such conjunctive coding had not been found in the hippocampal region. Here, we report neurons coding for angular and linear velocity, distributed across the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and the parasubiculum. These self-motion neurons often conjunctively encoded position and/or direction, yet lacked a structured organisation, calling for the revision of current CAN models. These results offer insights as to how linear/angular speed - derivative in time of position/direction - may allow the updating of spatial representations, possibly uncovering a generalised algorithm to update any representation.",

Following structure determination of the monomeric LH1-RC including its previously unrecognized component designated protein-U (Nat. Commun. 12, 6300, 2021), here we present cryo-EM structures of the dimeric LH1-RC from native Rba. sphaeroides IL106 at 2.75 [A] resolution and from an LH1-RC monomer lacking protein-U ({Delta}U) at 2.64 [A] resolution. The native dimeric core complex reveals many asymmetric features in the arrangement of its two monomeric components including the structural integrity of protein-U, the overall LH1 organization, and the rigidities of the proteins and pigments that form the complex. PufX polypeptides play a critical role in connecting two monomers, with one PufX interacting at its N-terminus with another PufX and an LH1 {beta}-polypeptide in another monomer, in good agreement with biochemical analyses. One of the proteins-U was only partially identified in the dimeric structure, signaling significantly different degrees of disorder in the two monomers. The {Delta}U LH1-RC monomer revealed a half-moon-shaped structure containing 11 - and 10 {beta}-polypeptides (compared with 14 of each in the wild type), indicating a critical role for protein-U in controlling the number of {beta}-subunits required for correct assembly and stabilization of the LH1-RC dimer. The structural features are discussed in relation to the unusual topology of intracytoplasmic photosynthetic membranes and an assembly model proposed for the native Rba. sphaeroides dimeric LH1-RC complex in membranes of wild-type cells.",

Here we asked if such extreme physiology might have an immune component. The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ and plays an essential role in response to immunological insults and may participate in combating cancer and slowing ageing. We investigated the anatomy, molecular composition and function of the NM-R spleen using RNA-sequencing and histological analysis in healthy animals. We found that spleen size in healthy NM-Rs varies considerably. We therefore classified NM-Rs according to spleen size as NM-Rs with small spleens or enlarged spleens. Animals with enlarged spleens showed potentially better anti-microbial profiles and were much more likely to have a high rank within the colony. Splenomegaly was associated with infection in sick NM-Rs, but not in NM-Rs with enlarged spleens. In all healthy NM-Rs splenic erythropoiesis, megakaryopoiesis and myelopoiesis were increased, but B lymphopoiesis was reduced and splenic marginal zone showed markedly altered morphology when compared to other rodents. However, in NM-Rs lymphocytes were found in secondary sites such as lymph nodes, gut lymphoid nodules and thymus. Thus, the NM-R spleen is a major site of adult hematopoiesis under normal physiological conditions. Overall, the NM-R immune system seems to rely mainly on innate immune responses with a more restricted adaptive immune response. We propose that the anatomical plasticity of the spleen might be regulated by social interaction and gives immunological advantage to increase the life-span of higher ranked animals.",

Frequently, therapeutic glycoproteins exhibit a heterogeneous array of glycans that are intended to mimic human glycopatterns. While immunogenic responses to biologic drugs are uncommon, enabling exquisite control of glycosylation with minimized microheterogeneity would improve their safety, efficacy and bioavailability. Therefore, close attention has been drawn to the development of glycoengineering strategies to control the glycan structures. With the accumulation of knowledge about the glycan biosynthesis enzymes, enzymatic glycan remodeling provides a potential strategy to construct highly ordered glycans with improved efficiency and biocompatibility. In this study, we quantitatively evaluate more than 30 enzymes for glycoengineering immobilized immunoglobulin G, an impactful glycoprotein class in the pharmaceutical field. We demonstrate successive glycan remodeling in a solid-phase platform, which enabled IgG glycan harmonization into a series of complex-type N-glycoforms with high yield and efficiency while retaining native IgG binding affinity.\n\nSignificanceGlycosylation plays critical functional and structural roles in protein biology. However, our understanding of how discrete glycan structures affect protein behaviors remains extremely limited due to the naturally occurring microheterogeneity. Through the use of characterized glycoengineering enzyme combination, we report a solid-phase glycan remodeling (SPGR) platform that enables efficient IgG glycan harmonization into several glycoforms of interest with high biocompatibility to the substrates. It provides an efficient strategy to screen the biological behavior of distinct glycoforms, building a fundamental understanding of glycosylation.",

PF-07321332 developed by Pfizer is the first orally administered inhibitor targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which also has shown potency against other coronaviruses.

To test this possibility, we characterized the growth kinetics and transcriptome of S. aureus in supernatants of the abundant CRS anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum. While growth was initially delayed, S. aureus ultimately grew to similar levels as in the control medium. The transcriptome was significantly affected by F. nucleatum metabolites, with the agr quorum sensing system notably repressed. Conversely, expression of fadX, encoding a putative propionate coA-transferase, was significantly increased, leading to our hypothesis that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by F. nucleatum could mediate S. aureus growth behavior and gene expression. Supplementation with propionate and butyrate, but not acetate, recapitulated delayed growth phenotypes observed in F. nucleatum supernatants. A fadX mutant was found to be more sensitive than wild type to propionate, suggesting a role for FadX in the S. aureus SCFA stress response. Interestingly, spontaneous resistance to butyrate, but not propionate, was frequently observed. Whole genome sequencing and targeted mutagenesis identified codY mutants as resistant to butyrate inhibition. Together, these data show that S. aureus physiology is dependent on its co-colonizing microbiota and metabolites they exchange, and indicate that propionate and butyrate may act on different targets in S. aureus to suppress its growth.\n\nImportanceS. aureus is an important CRS pathogen, yet is found in the upper airways of 30-50% of people without complications. The presence of strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria in CRS sinuses has recently spurred research into bacterial interactions and how they influence S. aureus physiology and pathogenesis. We show here that propionate and butyrate produced by one such CRS anaerobe, F. nucleatum, alter the growth and gene expression of S. aureus. We show that fadX is important for S. aureus to resist propionate stress, and that the CodY regulon mediates growth in inhibitory concentrations of butyrate. This work highlights the possible complexity of S. aureus-anaerobe interactions, and implicates membrane stress as a possible mechanism influencing S. aureus behavior in CRS sinuses.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is reemerging as a valuable tool to combat multidrug resistant bacteria. A major hurdle in developing efficacious bacteriophage therapies is that bacteria acquire resistance to phage killing. In this context, it is noteworthy that quorum sensing (QS), the bacterial cell-to-cell communication mechanism that promotes collective undertaking of group behaviors including anti-phage defenses, enhances bacterial survival in the face of phage attack. QS relies on the production, release, accumulation, and detection of signal molecules called autoinducers. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the LasI/R QS system induces the RhlI/R QS system, and these two systems control, in opposing manners, the PQS QS system that relies on the autoinducer called PQS. A {Delta}lasI mutant is impaired in PQS synthesis, leading to accumulation of the precursor molecule HHQ. HHQ suppresses growth of the P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI strain. We uncover a phage infection-induced mechanism that restores expression of the pqsH gene in the P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI QS mutant. PqsH converts HHQ into PQS, preventing HHQ-mediated growth inhibition. Thus, phage-infected P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI cells exhibit superior growth compared to uninfected cells. Phage infection also restores expression of virulence factors and the CRISPR-cas anti-phage defense system in the P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI strain. This study highlights a challenge for phage therapy, namely that phage infection may make particular bacterial strains faster growing, more virulent, and resistant to phage killing.\n\nImportanceThe emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria necessitates development of new antimicrobial therapies. Phage therapy relies on exploiting phages, natural enemies of bacteria, in the fight against pathogenic bacteria. For successful phage therapy development, potent phages that exhibit low propensity for acquisition of bacterial resistance are desired. Here, we show that phage infection restores QS, a cell-to-cell communication mechanism in a P. aeruginosa QS mutant, which increases its virulence and resistance to phage killing. Importantly, clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa frequently harbor mutations in particular QS genes. Thus, phage therapies against such P. aeruginosa strains may inadvertently increase bacterial virulence. Our study underscores the importance of characterizing phage-host interactions in the context of bacterial mutants that are relevant in clinical settings prior to selecting phages for therapy.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Retroviruses are widely distributed in all vertebrates, as are their endogenous form, endogenous retrovirus (ERV), which serves as \"fossil\" evidence to trace the ancient origins and history of virus-host interactions over millions of years. The retroviral envelope (Env) plays a significant role in host range determination, but major information on genetic diversification in anamniotes is lacking. Here, by incorporating multiple-round in silico similarity search and phylogenomic analysis, 25498 ERVs with gamma-type Env (GTE), covalently associated Env, were discovered by searching against all 974 available fish and 19 amphibian genomes, but no beta-type Env (BTE), noncovalently associated Env, were found. Furthermore, a nine-type classification system of anamniote GTE was proposed by combining phylogenetic and domain/motif analyses. The elastic genomic organization and overall phylogenetic incongruence between anamniotic Env and its neighboring polymerase (Pol) implied that early retroviral diversification in anamniotic vertebrates was facilitated by frequent recombination. At last, host opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) gene capturing by anamniotic ERVs with GTE was reported for the first time. Overall, our findings overturn traditional Pol genotyping and reveal a complex evolutionary history of anamniotic retroviruses inferred by Env evolution.\n\nAuthor summaryAlthough the retroviral envelope (Env) protein in amniotes has been well studied, its evolutionary history in anamniotic vertebrates is ambiguous. By analyzing more than 25000 ERVs with gamma-type Env (GTE) in anamniotes, several important evolutionary features were identified. First, GTE were found to be widely distributed among different amphibians and fish. Second, nine types of GTE were discovered, revealing the great genetic diversity. Third, GTE-containing ERVs have rampantly proliferated in certain amphibians such as Ambystoma mexicanum, and the copy number was found to be markedly higher than 10000. Fourth, the incongruence between the Env and Pol phylogenies suggested that frequent recombination shaped the early evolution of anamniote retroviruses. Fifth, an ancient horizontal gene transfer event was discovered from anamniotes to ERVs with GTE. These findings reveal a complex evolution pattern for retroviral Env in anamniotes.",

When targeted to an integrated prophage, the crRNA-guided (Csy) complex and a majority of Cas3 molecules in the cell are recruited to a single focus. When lacking a target in the cell, however, the Csy complex is broadly nucleoid bound, while Cas3 is diffuse in the cytoplasm. Nucleoid association for the Csy proteins is crRNA-dependent, and inhibited by expression of anti-CRISPR AcrIF2, which blocks PAM binding. The Cas9 nuclease is also nucleoid localized, only when gRNA-bound, which is abolished by PAM mimic, AcrIIA4.

The study of O157:H7 is difficult due to the high specificity of the bacteria for the human intestine, along with our lack of sufficiently complex human cell culture models. The recent development of human intestinal enteroids derived from intestinal crypt multipotent stem cells has allowed us to construct 2-dimensional differentiated epithelial monolayers grown in transwells that mimic the human intestine. Unlike previous studies, saline was added to the apical surface, while maintaining culture media in the basolateral well. The monolayers continued to grow and differentiate with apical saline. Apical infection with O157:H7 or commensal E. coli resulted in robust bacterial growth from 105 to over 108 over 24 hours. Despite this robust bacterial growth, commensal E. coli neither adhered to nor damaged the epithelial barrier over 30 hours. However, O157:H7 was almost fully adhered (>90%) by 18 hours with epithelial damage observed by 30 hours. O157:H7 contains the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island responsible for attachment and damage to the intestinal epithelium. Previous studies report the ability of nutrients such as biotin, D-serine, and L-fucose to downregulate LEE gene expression. O157:H7 treated with biotin or L-fucose, but not D-serine displayed both decreased attachment and reduced epithelial damage over 36 hours.

    "preprint_abstract": "In rapidly evolving populations, numerous beneficial and deleterious mutations can arise and segregate within a population at the same time. In this regime, evolutionary dynamics cannot be analyzed using traditional population genetic approaches that assume that sites evolve independently. Instead, the dynamics of many loci must be analyzed simultaneously. Recent work has made progress by first analyzing the fitness variation within a population, and then studying how individual lineages interact with this traveling fitness wave. However, these \"traveling wave\" models have previously been restricted to extreme cases where selection on individual mutations is either much faster or much slower than the typical coalescent timescale Tc. In this work, we show how the traveling wave framework can be extended to intermediate regimes in which the scaled fitness effects of mutations (Tcs) are neither large nor small compared to one. This enables us to describe the dynamics of populations subject to a wide range of fitness effects, and in particular, in cases where it is not immediately clear which mutations are most important in shaping the dynamics and statistics of genetic diversity. We use this approach to derive new expressions for the fixation probabilities and site frequency spectra of mutations as a function of their scaled fitness effects, along with related results for the coalescent timescale Tc and the rate of adaptation or Mullers ratchet. We find that competition between linked mutations can have a dramatic impact on the proportions of neutral and selected polymorphisms, which is not simply summarized by the scaled selection coefficient Tcs. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for population genetic inferences.",

The development of high-throughput functional assays leads to the discovery of experimental validated noncoding functional variants. However, these validated variants are rare due to technical difficulty and financial cost. The small sample size of validated variants makes it less reliable to develop a supervised machine learning model for achieving a whole genome-wide prediction of noncoding causal variants.\n\nResultsWe will exploit a deep transfer learning model, which is based on convolutional neural network, to improve the prediction for functional noncoding variants. To address the challenge of small sample size, the transfer learning model leverages both large-scale generic functional noncoding variants to improve the learning of low-level features and context-specific functional noncoding variants to learn high-level features toward the contextspecific prediction task. By evaluating the deep transfer learning model on three MPRA datasets and 16 GWAS datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms deep learning models without pretraining or retraining.

KCNQ2 related-DEE is characterized by pharmaco-resistant neonatal seizures associated with a developmental delay. While seizures usually resolve some weeks or months after birth, cognitive/behavioral deficits persist. To better understand the cellular mechanisms underlying KCNQ2-associated network dysfunction and their progression over time, we investigated in vivo, using local field potential recordings of freely moving animals, and ex-vivo in layers II/III and V of motor cortical slices, using patch-clamp recordings, the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal cells from a heterozygous knock-in (KI) mouse model carrying the p.T274M pathogenic variant during neonatal, post-weaning and juvenile developmental stages. We found that KI mice displayed spontaneous seizures preferentially at post-weaning rather than at juvenile stages. At the cellular level, the variant led to a reduction in M current density/chord conductance and to an increase in neuronal excitability. These alterations were observed already during the neonatal period in pyramidal cells of layers II / III and during post-weaning stage in pyramidal cells of layer V. Moreover there was an increase in the frequency of spontaneous network driven events mediated by GABA receptors in the layers II/III suggesting that the excitability of some interneurons was also increased. However, all these alterations were time limited and no more observed in layers II/III and V of juvenile mice. At this stage, M-current density and neuronal excitability were not different from the measurements made in juvenile wild-type mice. Thus our data indicate that the action of the variant on neuronal activity is developmentally regulated and that some cellular mechanisms leading to the recovery of Kv7/M channels function took place during brain maturation of KI mice. These results raise the possibility that the age related seizure remission observed in KCNQ2-related DEE patient results also from a time limited alteration of Kv7 channels activity and neuronal excitability.",

Csk also binds phosphatases, including PTPN12 (PTP-PEST) and immune-cell PTPN22 (LYP/Pep), which dephosphorylate the SFK activation loop to promote autoinhibition. Csk-binding proteins (e.g., CBP/PAG1) oligomerize within membrane microdomains, and high local concentration promotes Csk function. Purified Csk homodimerizes in solution through an interface that overlaps the phosphatase binding footprint. Here we demonstrate that Csk can homodimerize in Jurkat T cells, in competition with PTPN22 binding. We designed SH3-domain mutations in Csk that selectively impair homodimerization (H21I) or PTPN22 binding (K43D) and verified their kinase activity in solution. Disruption of either interaction, however, decreased the negative-regulatory function of Csk in cells. Csk W47A, a substitution previously reported to block PTPN22 binding, also impairs homodimerization. Csk H21I and K43D will be useful tools for dissecting the protein-specific drivers of autoimmunity mediated by the human polymorphism PTPN22 R620W, which impairs interaction with Csk and with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3.

Dopamine has a powerful effect on prefrontal circuits via the D1-type dopamine receptor (D1DR). It has been proposed that prefrontal dopamine has \"inverted U-shaped\" dynamics, with optimal dopamine and D1DR signaling required for optimal cognitive function. However, the quantitative relationship between prefrontal dopamine and cognitive function is not clear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of published manipulations of prefrontal dopamine and the effects on working memory, a high-level executive function in humans, primates, and rodents that involves maintaining and manipulating information over seconds to minutes. We reviewed 646 papers and found that 75 studies met criteria for inclusion. Our quantification of effect sizes for dopamine, D1DRs, and behavior revealed a negative quadratic slope. This is consistent with the proposed inverted U-shape of prefrontal dopamine and D1DRs and working memory performance, explaining 10% of the variance. Of note, the inverted quadratic fit was much stronger for prefrontal D1DRs alone, explaining 26% of the variance, compared to prefrontal dopamine alone, explaining 10% of the variance. Taken together, these data, derived from a variety of manipulations and systems, demonstrate that optimal prefrontal dopamine signalling is linked with higher cognitive function. Our results provide insight into the fundamental dynamics of prefrontal dopamine, which could be useful for pharmacological interventions targeting prefrontal dopaminergic circuits, and into the pathophysiology of human brain disease.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Learning and memory play a central role in emotional disorders, particularly in depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. We present a new, transdiagnostic theory of how memory and mood interact in emotional disorders. Drawing upon retrieved-context models of episodic memory, we propose that memories form associations with the contexts in which they are encoded, including emotional valence and arousal. Later, encountering contextual cues retrieves their associated memories, which in turn reactivate the context that was present during encoding. We first show how our retrieved-context model accounts for findings regarding the organization of emotional memories in list-learning experiments. We then show how this model predicts clinical phenomena, including persistent negative mood after chronic stressors, intrusive memories of painful events, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapies.",

Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is modified at more than 100 locations, particularly at highly conserved and functionally important nucleotides. During ribosome biogenesis, modifications are added at various stages of assembly. The existence of differently modified classes of ribosomes in normal cells is unknown because no method exists to simultaneously evaluate the modification status at all sites within a single rRNA molecule. Using a combination of yeast genetics and nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we developed a reliable method to track the modification status of single rRNA molecules at 37 sites in 18S rRNA and 73 sites in 25S rRNA. We use our method to characterize patterns of modification heterogeneity and identify concerted modification of nucleotides found near functional centers of the ribosome. Distinct, undermodified subpopulations of rRNAs accumulate upon loss of Dbp3 or Prp43 RNA helicases, suggesting overlapping roles in ribosome biogenesis. Modification profiles are surprisingly resistant to change in response to many genetic and acute environmental conditions that affect translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mRNA splicing.

Here, we profile highly conserved CpGs in 339 predominantly female mice belonging to the BXD family for which we have deep longevity and genomic data. We use a  pan-mammalian microarray that provides a common platform for assaying the methylome across mammalian clades. We computed epigenetic clocks and tested associations with DNAm entropy, diet, weight, metabolic traits, and genetic variation. We describe the multifactorial variance of methylation at these CpGs, and show that high fat diet augments the age-associated changes. Entropy increases with age. The progression to disorder, particularly at CpGs that gain methylation over time, was predictive of genotype-dependent life expectancy. The longer-lived BXD strains had comparatively lower entropy at a given age. We identified two genetic loci that modulate rates of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA): one on chromosome (Chr) 11 that encompasses the Erbb2/Her2 oncogenic region, and a second on Chr19 that contains a cytochrome P450 cluster. Both loci harbor genes associated with EAA in humans including STXBP4, NKX2-3, and CUTC. Transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed associations with oxidation-reduction, metabolic, and immune response pathways. Our results highlight concordant loci for EAA in humans and mice, and demonstrate a tight coupling between the metabolic state and epigenetic aging.",

Such task-related responses (\"TRRs\") covary with reward magnitude and physiological signatures of arousal. It is unknown, however, if TRRs change on a trial-to-trial basis according to behavioral performance and task difficulty. If so, this would suggest that TRRs reflect arousal on a trial-to-trial timescale and covary with critical task and behavioral variables. We measured fMRI-BOLD responses in the early visual cortex of human observers performing an orientation discrimination task consisting of separate easy and hard runs of trials. Stimuli were presented in a small portion of one hemifield, but the fMRI response was measured in the ipsilateral hemisphere, far from the stimulus representation and focus of spatial attention. TRRs scaled in amplitude with task difficulty, behavioral accuracy, reaction time, and lapses across trials. These modulations were not explained by the influence of respiration, cardiac activity, or head movement on the fMRI signal. Similar modulations with task difficulty and behavior were observed in pupil size. These results suggest that TRRs reflect arousal and behavior on the timescale of individual trials.",

However, soybean-growing areas across Europe have been rapidly increasing in response to a rising demand for locally-produced, non-GM soybean in recent years. This raises questions about the suitability of European agro-climatic conditions for soybean production. We used data-driven relationships between climate and soybean yield derived from machine-learning techniques to make yield projections under current and future climate with moderate (RCP 4.5) to intense (RCP 8.5) warming, up to the 2050s and 2090s time horizons. Results suggest that a self-sufficiency level of 50% (100%) would be achievable in Europe under historical and future climate if 4-5% (9-12%) of the current European cropland is dedicated to soybean production. The associated increase in soybean area in Europe would bring environmental benefits, with a potential decrease of nitrogen fertilizer use in Europe by 5-8% (13-18%) and a possible reduction of deforestation in biodiversity hotspots in South America. However, it would also lead to an important reduction in the production of other cultivated species in Europe (e.g. cereals) and a potential increase in the use of irrigation water.",

Brain temperature shows wide variations across brain states, and such changes may explain quantitative changes in network oscillations. Here we report on the coupling of various hippocampal sharp wave ripple features to brain temperature. Ripple frequency, occurrence rate and duration correlated with temperature dynamics. By focal manipulation of the brain temperature in the hippocampal CA1 region, we show that ripple frequency can be increased and decreased by local heating and cooling, respectively. Changes of other parameters, such as the rate of SPW-R and ripple duration were not consistently affected. Our findings suggest that brain temperature in the CA1 region plays a leading role in affecting the ripple frequency, whereas other parameters of SPW-Rs may be determined by mechanisms upstream from the CA1 region. These findings illustrate that physiological variations of brain temperature exert important effects on hippocampal circuit operations.",

One of the most prominent examples is the FDA-approved pharmacological chaperone lumacaftor (VX-809), which has transformed cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy. CF is a fatal disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). VX-809 corrects folding of F508del CFTR, the most common patient mutation, yet F508del exhibits only mild VX-809 response. In contrast, rarer mutations P67L and L206W are hyper-responsive to VX-809, while G85E is non-responsive. Despite the clinical success of VX-809, the mechanistic origin for the distinct susceptibility of mutants remains unclear. Here, we use interactomics to characterize the impact of VX-809 on proteostasis interactions of P67L and L206W and compare these to F508del and G85E. We determine hyper-responsive mutations P67L and L206W exhibit decreased interactions with proteasomal, and autophagy degradation machinery compared to F508del and G85E. We then show inhibiting the proteasome attenuates P67L and L206W VX-809 response, and inhibiting the lysosome attenuates F508del VX-809 response. Our data suggests a previously unidentified but required role for protein degradation in VX-809 correction. Furthermore, we present an approach for identifying proteostasis characteristics of mutant-specific therapeutic response to pharmacological chaperones.",

However, no reference standards currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics over time, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and weight1. Here, we built an interactive resource to benchmark brain morphology, www.brainchart.io, derived from any current or future sample of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans from 101,457 participants aged from 115 days post-conception through 100 postnatal years, across more than 100 primary research studies. Cerebrum tissue volumes and other global or regional MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories2 of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones3; showed high stability of individual centile scores over longitudinal assessments; and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared to non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardised measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In sum, brain charts are an essential first step towards robust quantification of individual deviations from normative trajectories in multiple, commonly-used neuroimaging phenotypes. Our collaborative study proves the principle that brain charts are achievable on a global scale over the entire lifespan, and applicable to analysis of diverse developmental and clinical effects on human brain structure. Furthermore, we provide open resources to support future advances towards adoption of brain charts as standards for quantitative benchmarking of typical or atypical brain MRI scans.",

However, a recent report argued that Ser68 phosphoregulation is dispensable for accurate CENP-A loading. Here, we report that the substitution of Ser68 of endogenous CENP-A with either Gln68 or Glu68 severely impairs CENP-A deposition and cell viability. We also find that mice harboring the corresponding mutations are lethal.

RecBCD is a nuclease complex that plays a major role in nuclease activity in E. coli, with the RecB subunit possessing the actual nuclease activity. We created a RecB knockout of an E. coli strain optimized for cell-free expression. We named this new strain Akaby. We demonstrated that Akaby TXTL successfully reduced linear DNA degradations, rescuing the protein expression efficiency from the linear DNA templates. The practicality of Akaby for TXTL is an efficient, simple alternative for linear template expression in cell-free reactions.

In rodents, three ascending somatosensory pathways process and relay orofacial mechanosensory input: the lemniscal, paralemniscal, and extralemniscal. Two of these pathways (the lemniscal and extralemniscal) exhibit highly structured topographic representations of the orofacial sensory surface, as exemplified by the one-to-one somatotopic mapping between vibrissae on the animals face and barrelettes in brainstem, barreloids in thalamus, and barrels in cortex. Here we use the Prrxl1 knockout mouse model to investigate ingestive behavior deficits associated with disruption of the lemniscal pathway. The Prrxl1 deletion disrupts somatotopic patterning and axonal projections throughout the lemniscal pathway but spares patterning in the extralemniscal nucleus. Our data reveal an imprecise and inefficient ingestive phenotype with deficits that span timescales from milliseconds to months, tightly linking trigeminal input with ingestion, from moment-to-moment consummatory to long term appetitive control. We suggest that ordered assembly of trigeminal sensory information along the lemniscal pathway is critical for the rapid and precise modulation of motor circuits driving eating and drinking action sequences.",

Understanding how to best conserve these single population threatened species (SPTS) is therefore a distinct and important task for threatened species conservation science. As a last resort, managers of SPTS may consider taking the entire population into captivity - ex situ, in toto conservation. In the past, this choice has been taken to the great benefit of the SPTS, but it has also lead to catastrophe. Here, we develop a decision-support tool for planning when to trigger this difficult action. Our method considers the uncertain and ongoing decline of the SPTS, the possibility that drastic ex situ action will fail, and the opportunities offered by delaying the decision. Specifically, these benefits are additional time for ongoing in situ actions to succeed, and opportunities for the managers to learn about the system. To illustrate its utility, we apply the decision tool to four retrospective case-studies of declining SPTS. As well as offering support to this particular decision, our tool illustrates why trigger points for difficult conservation decisions should be formulated in advance, but must also be adaptive. A trigger-point for the ex situ, in toto conservation of a SPTS, for example, will not take the form of a simple threshold abundance.",

The rationale behind our biobanking are explorations of post-zygotic pathogenic gene variants, especially in non-tumoral tissue, which might predispose to cancers. The targeted diagnoses are carcinomas of the breast (via mastectomy or breast conserving surgery), colon and rectum, prostate, and urinary bladder (via cystectomy or transurethral resection), exocrine pancreatic carcinoma as well as metastases of colorectal cancer to the liver. The choice was based on the high incidence of these cancers and/or frequent fatal outcome. We also collect age-matched normal controls. Our still ongoing collection originates from five clinical centers and after nearly 2-year cooperation reached 1711 patients and controls, yielding a total of 23226 independent samples, with an average of 74 donors and 1010 samples collected per month. The predominant diagnosis is breast carcinoma, with 933 donors, followed by colorectal carcinoma (383 donors), prostate carcinoma (221 donors), bladder carcinoma (81 donors), exocrine pancreatic carcinoma (15 donors) and metachronous colorectal cancer metastases to liver (14 donors). Forty percent of the total sample count originates from macroscopically healthy cancer-neighboring tissue, while contribution from tumors is 12%, which adds to the uniqueness of our collection for cancer predisposition studies. Moreover, we developed two program packages, enabling registration of patients, clinical data and samples at the participating hospitals as well as the central system of sample/data management at coordinating center.

This prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines (CHARM) study enabled assessment of T cell responses in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected participants.\n\nAt enrollment all participants were negative by qPCR; follow-up occurred biweekly and then bimonthly for the next 6 weeks. Study participants who tested positive by qPCR SARS-CoV-2 test were asked to enroll in an immune response sub-study. FluoroSpot interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and IL2 responses following qPCR-confirmed infection at enrollment (day 0), day 7 and 14 and more than 28 days later were measured using pools of 17mer peptides covering S, N, and M proteins, or CD4+CD8 peptide pools containing predicted epitopes from multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens.\n\nAmong 124 asymptomatic and 105 symptomatic participants, SARS-CoV-2 infection generated IFN-{gamma} responses to the S, N and M proteins that persisted longer in asymptomatic cases. IFN-{gamma} responses were significantly (p=0.001) more frequent to the N pool (51.4%) than the M pool (18.9%) among asymptomatic subjects; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.06) for symptomatic subjects (N pool: 44.4%; M pool: 25.9%). In asymptomatic participants IFN-{gamma} responders to the CD4+CD8 pool responded more frequently to the S pool (55.6%) and N pool (57.1%), than the M pool (7.1%), but symptomatic participants, IFN-{gamma} responses were more frequent to the S pool (75.0%) than N pool (33.3%) and M pool (33.3%). The frequencies of IFN-{gamma} responses to the S and N+M pools peaked 7 days after the positive qPCR test among asymptomatic (S pool: 22.2%; N+M pool: 28.7%) and symptomatic (S pool: 15.3%; N+M pool 21.9%) participants and dropped by >28 days. Magnitudes of post-infection IFN-{gamma} and IL2 responses to the N+M pool were significantly correlated with IFN-{gamma} and IL2 responses to the N and M pools.\n\nThese data further support the central role of Th1-biased cell mediated immunity IFN-{gamma} and IL2 responses, particularly to the N protein, in controlling COVID-19 symptoms, and justify T cell-based COVID-19 vaccines that include the N and S proteins.",

The mouth microbiota and its associated enzymes are the first to encounter food and therefore likely to be the most affected.\n\nEight saliva samples from ten individuals were exposed to two sulfite preservatives, sodium sulfite and sodium bisulfite. One sample set was evaluated for bacteria composition utilizing 16s rRNA sequencing, and the number of viable cells in all sample sets was determined utilizing ATP assays at 10 and 40-minute exposure times. All untreated samples were analyzed for baseline lysozyme activity, and possible correlations between the number of viable cells and lysozyme activity.\n\nSequencing results indicated significant increases in alpha diversity with sodium bisulfite exposure and changes in relative abundance of 3 amplicon sequence variants (ASV). Sodium sulfite treated samples showed a significant decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, a marginally significant change in alpha diversity, and a significant change in the relative abundance for Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and for 6 ASVs. Beta diversity didnt show any separation between groups, however, all but one sample set was observed to be moving in the same direction under sodium sulfite treatment in a principal component analysis.\n\nATP assays indicated a significant and consistent average decrease in activity ranging from 24 - 46% at both exposure times with both sulfites.\n\nAverage initial rates of lysozyme activity between all individuals ranged from +/- 76% compared to individual variations of +/- 10 - 34%. No consistent, significant correlation was found between ATP and lysozyme activity in any sample sets.\n\nConclusionsSulfite preservatives, at concentrations regarded as safe by the FDA, alter the relative abundance and richness of the microbiota found in saliva, and decrease the number of viable cells, within 10 minutes of exposure.",

Here, we incubated aged and unaged eastern white pine wood biochar produced at 350 and 550 {degrees}C with a Streptomyces isolate, a putative biochar-decomposing microbe. Ageing was simulated via exposure to (a) alternating freeze-thaw and wet-dry cycles (physical ageing), (b) concentrated hydrogen peroxide (chemical ageing) and (c) nutrients and microorganisms (biological ageing). Elemental composition and surface chemistry (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) of biochar samples were compared before and after ageing. Ageing significantly increased biochar C mineralization in the case of physically aged 350 {degrees}C biochar (p < 0.001). Among 350 {degrees}C biochars, biochar C mineralization was positively correlated with an increase in O/C ratio (R2 = 0.78) and O-containing functional groups (R2 = 0.73) post-ageing, suggesting that surface oxidation during ageing enhanced biochar degradation by the isolate. However, in the case of 550 {degrees}C biochar, ageing did not result in a significant change in biochar C mineralization (p > 0.05), likely due to lower surface oxidation and high condensed aromatic C content. These results have implications for the use of biochar for long term C storage in soils.\n\nSynopsisThis study highlights the impact of ageing on the microbial mineralization of biochar, which can affect its long-term C storage capacity.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/430652v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f3d6dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149ebe3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d8df9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5404a7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Activation of BKCa channels present in mitochondria of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes is implicated in cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. However, the BKCa channels activity has never been detected in the plasma membrane of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes. In this study, we report the presence of the BKCa channel in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of neonatal murine and rodent cardiomyocytes which protects the heart on inhibition but not activation. Furthermore, K+ currents measured in neonatal cardiomyocyte (NCM) was sensitive to iberiotoxin (IbTx), suggesting the presence of BKCa channels in the plasma membrane. Neonatal hearts subjected to IR when post-conditioned with NS1619 during reoxygenation increased the myocardial infarction whereas IbTx reduced the infarct size. In agreement, isolated NCM also presented increased apoptosis on treatment with NS1619 during hypoxia and reoxygenation, whereas IbTx reduced TUNEL positive cells. In NCMs, activation of BKCa channels increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species post HR injury. Electrophysiological characterization of NCMs indicated that NS1619 increased the beat period, field, and action potential duration, and decreased the conduction velocity and spike amplitude. In contrast, IbTx had no impact on the electrophysiological properties of NCMs. Taken together, our data established that inhibition of plasma membrane BKCa channels in the NCM protects neonatal heart/cardiomyocytes from IR injury. Furthermore, the functional disparity observed towards the cardioprotective activity of BKCa channels in adults compared to neonatal heart could be attributed to their differential localization.",

The SARS-CoV-2 spike, a surface-anchored trimeric class-I fusion-glycoprotein essential for viral entry, represents a key target for developing vaccines and therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-variants that facilitate virus spread and may affect vaccine efficacy highlights the need to identify novel antiviral strategies for COVID-19 therapy. Here we demonstrate that nitazoxanide, an antiprotozoal agent with recognized broad-spectrum antiviral activity, interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis, hampering its maturation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage. Engineering multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant-pseudoviruses and utilizing quantitative cell-cell fusion assays, we show that nitazoxanide-induced spike modifications hinder progeny virion infectivity as well as spike-driven pulmonary cell-cell fusion, a critical feature of COVID-19 pathology. Nitazoxanide, being equally effective against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-spike and different emerging variants, including the Delta variant of concern, may represent a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19 infections.",

The two groups evolved from at least one common hybridisation event but have subsequently diverged with Group I strains losing many S. cerevisiae chromosomes while the Group II strains retain both sub-genomes. The complex genomes, containing orthologous alleles from the parental chromosomes, pose interesting questions regarding gene regulation and its impact on the fermentation properties of the strains. Superimposed on the presence of orthologous alleles are complexities of gene dosage due to the aneuploid nature of the genomes. We examined the contribution of the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus alleles to the gene expression patterns of Group I and II strains during fermentation. We show that the relative expression of S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus orthologues is positively correlated with gene copy number. Despite the reduced S. cerevisiae content in the Group I strain, S. cerevisiae orthologues contribute to biochemical pathways upregulated during fermentation which may explain the retention of specific chromosomes in the strain. Conversely, S. eubayanus genes are significantly overrepresented in the upregulated gene pool in the Group II strain. Comparison of the transcription profiles of Group I and II strains during fermentation identified both common and unique gene expression patterns, with gene copy number being a dominant contributory factor. Thus, the aneuploid genomes create complex patterns of gene expression during fermentation with gene dosage playing a crucial role both within and between strains.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Humans and other animals are able to adjust their speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) at will depending on the urge to act, favoring either cautious or hasty decision policies in different contexts. An emerging view is that SAT regulation relies on influences exerting broad changes on the motor system, tuning its activity up globally when hastiness is at premium. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis. Fifty subjects performed a task involving choices between left and right index fingers, in which incorrect choices led either to a high or to a low penalty in two contexts, inciting them to emphasize either cautious or hasty policies. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation on multiple motor representations, eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEP) in nine finger and leg muscles. MEP amplitudes allowed us to probe activity changes in the corresponding finger and leg representations, while subjects were deliberating about which index to choose. Our data indicate that hastiness entails a broad amplification of motor activity, though this amplification was limited to the chosen side. On top of this effect, we identified a local suppression of motor activity, surrounding the chosen index representation. Hence, a decision policy favoring speed over accuracy appears to rely on overlapping processes producing a broad (but not global) amplification and a surround suppression of motor activity. The latter effect may help to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the chosen representation, as supported by single-trial correlation analyses indicating a stronger differentiation of activity changes in finger representations in the hasty context.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Phytohormone gibberellin (GA) is an important plant signaling molecule that regulates plant growth and defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. To date, the molecular mechanism of the plant responses to viral infection mediated by GA is still undetermined. DELLA is a repressor of GA signaling and is recognized by the F-box protein, a component of the SCFSLY1/GID2 complex. The recognized DELLA is degraded by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome, leading to the activation of the GA signaling. Here, we report that ageratum leaf curl Sichuan virus (ALCScV)-infected N. benthamiana plants showed dwarfing symptom and abnormal flower development. The infection of ALCScV alters the expressions of GA pathway-related genes and decreases the content of endogenous GA significantly in N. benthamiana. Further, ALCScV-encoded C4 protein interacts with the DELLA protein NbGAI, and interferes with the interaction between NbGAI and NbGID2 to prevent the degradation of NbGAI, leading to the inhibition of the GA signaling pathway. Silencing of NbGAI or exogenous GA3 treatment significantly reduces viral accumulation and disease symptoms in N. benthamiana plants. The same results were proved by the experiments with C4 protein encoded by tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV). Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism of geminivirus C4 proteins controling virus infection and disease symptom development through interfering GA signaling pathway.\n\nAuthor SummaryGibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that are essential for many developmental processes in plants. It has indicated that plant virus infection can induce abnormal flower development and influence GA pathway resulting the plant dwarfing symptom, but the underlying mechanisms is still not well described. Here, we demonstrate that geminivirus - encoded C4 protein regulates the GA signaling pathway to promote viral accumulation and disease symptom development. Through directly interacting with NbGAI, the C4 protein interferes with the interaction between NbGAI and NbGID2, which inhibits the degradation of NbGAI. As a result, the GA signaling pathway is blocked, and the infected plants display symptoms of typical dwarfing and delayed flowering. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which geminivirus C4 proteins influence viral pathogenicity via interfering the GA signaling pathway, and provide new insights into the interaction between virus and host.",

The development of effective adulticides is hampered by a poor understanding of the processes and tissues driving parasite survival in the host. The adult filariae head region contains essential tissues that control parasite feeding, sensory, secretory, and reproductive behaviors, which express promising molecular substrates for the development of antifilarial drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. We have adapted spatial transcriptomic approaches to map gene expression patterns across these prioritized but historically intractable head tissues.

    "preprint_abstract": "Many pathogenic missense mutations are found in protein positions that are neither well-conserved nor belong to any known functional domains. Consequently, we lack any mechanistic underpinning of dysfunction caused by such mutations. We explored the disruption of allosteric dynamic coupling between these positions and the known functional sites as a possible mechanism for such mutations. In this study, we present an analysis of 144 human enzymes containing 591 pathogenic missense variants, in which allosteric dynamic coupling of mutated positions with known active sites provides insights into a primary biophysical mechanism and evidence of their functional importance. We illustrate this mechanism in a case study of {beta}-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which contains 94 Gaucher disease-associated missense variants located some distance away from the active site. An analysis of the conformational dynamics of GCase suggests that mutations on these distal sites cause changes in the flexibility of active site residues despite their distance, indicating a dynamic communication network throughout the protein. The disruption of the long-distance dynamic coupling due to the presence of missense mutations may provide a plausible general mechanistic explanation for biological dysfunction and disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenetic diseases occur when mutations to a particular gene cause a gain/loss in function of the related protein. Although several methods based on conservation and protein biochemistry exist to predict which genetic mutations may impact function, many disease causing changes remain unexplained by these metrics. In this study, we propose an explanation for these genetic changes may cause disease. In order to function, important regions of a protein must be able to exhibit collective motion. Through computer simulations, we observed that changing even a single amino acid within a protein can change the protein motion. Notably, disease causing genetic changes tend to alter the motion of regions which are critically important to protein function, even the mutations are far from these critical regions. In addition, we examined the degree that two amino acids within a protein may \"couple\" to one another, meaning the degree to which motion in one amino acid will affect the other. We found that amino acids which are highly coupled to the active site of a protein are more likely to result in disease if mutated, thereby offering a new tool for predicting genetic disease which incorporates internal protein dynamics.",

The ability to adapt to different salinity environments determines an organisms survival and ecological niches. Litoditis marina is a euryhaline marine nematode widely distributed in coastal ecosystems all over the world, although numerous genes involved in its salinity response have been reported, the adaptive mechanisms underlying its euryhalinity remain unexplored. Here, we utilized worms which have been acclimated to either low salinity or high salinity conditions and evaluated their basal gene expression at both transcriptomic and proteomic levels. We found that several conserved regulators, including osmolytes biosynthesis genes, transthyretin-like family genes, V-type H+-transporting ATPase and potassium channel genes, were involved in both short-term salinity stress response and long-term acclimation processes. In addition, we identified genes related to cell volume regulation, such as actin regulatory genes, Rho family small GTPases and diverse ion transporters, might contribute to hyposaline acclimation, while the glycerol biosynthesis genes gpdh-1 and gpdh-2 accompanied hypersaline acclimation in L. marina. Furthermore, gpdh-2 might play an essential role in transgenerational inheritance of osmotic stress protection in L. marina as in its relative nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Hereby, this study paves the way for further in-depth exploration on adaptive mechanisms underlying euryhalinity, and may also contribute to the studies of healthy ecosystems in the context of global climate change.",

We asked whether the machine learning (ML) approach could be used to infer and predict SSB properties of a regional flora based on easily available data.\n\nLocationEighteen calcareous grasslands located along an elevational gradient of almost 2000 m in the Bavarian Alps, Germany.\n\nMethodsWe compared a commonly used ML model (random forest) with a conventional model (linear regression model) as to their ability to predict SSB presence/absence and density using empirical data on SSB characteristics (environmental, seed traits and phylogenetic predictors). Further, we identified the most important determinants of seed persistence in soil for predicting qualitative and quantitative SSB characteristics using the ML approach.\n\nResultsWe demonstrated that the ML model predicts SSB characteristics significantly better than the linear regression model. A single set of predictors (either environment, or seed traits, or phylogenetic eigenvectors) was sufficient for the ML model to achieve high performance in predicting SSB characteristics. Importantly, we established that a few widely available SSB predictors can achieve high predictive power in the ML approach, suggesting a high flexibility of the developed approach for use in various study systems.\n\nConclusionsOur study provides a novel methodological approach that combines empirical knowledge on the determinants of SSB characteristics with a modern, flexible statistical approach based on ML. It clearly demonstrates that ML can be developed into a key tool to facilitate labor-intensive, costly and time-consuming functional trait research.",

Poly(ethylene glycol) and zwitterionic polymers are currently considered \"gold standard\" device coatings to reduce biofouling. To discover novel anti-biofouling materials, we created a combinatorial library of polyacrylamide-based copolymer hydrogels and screened their ability to prevent fouling from serum and platelet-rich plasma in a high-throughput parallel assay. We found certain non-intuitive copolymer compositions exhibit superior antibiofouling properties over current gold standard materials, and employed machine learning to identify key molecular features underpinning their performance. For validation, we coated the surfaces of electrochemical biosensors with our hydrogels and evaluated their anti-biofouling performance in vitro and in vivo in rodent models. Our copolymer hydrogels preserved device function and enabled continuous measurements of a small-molecule drug in vivo better than gold standard coatings. The novel methodology we describe enables the discovery of anti-biofouling materials that can extend the lifetime of real-time in vivo sensing devices.",

Here, we report that neurofibromin ablation dampens expression and activity of NADH dehydrogenase, the respiratory chain complex I, in an ERK-dependent fashion. This provides cells with resistance to pro-oxidants targeting complex I and decreases both respiration and intracellular NAD+. Expression of the alternative NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 raises NAD+/NADH ratio, enhances the activity of the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 and interferes with tumorigenicity in neurofibromin-deficient cells. This anti-neoplastic effect is mimicked both in vitro and in vivo by administration of NAD+ precursors or by rising expression of the NAD+ deacetylase SIRT3, and is synergistic with ablation of the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, which augments succinate dehydrogenase activity further contributing to block pro-neoplastic metabolic changes of these cells. These findings shed light on chemotherapeutic resistance and on bioenergetic adaptations of tumors lacking neurofibromin, linking complex I inhibition to mitochondrial NAD+/NADH unbalance and SIRT3 inhibition, as well as to down-regulation of succinate dehydrogenase. This metabolic rewiring could unveil attractive therapeutic targets for neoplasms related to neurofibromin loss.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Background and AimsHybridization is a common and important force in plant evolution. One of its outcomes is introgression - the transfer of small genomic regions from one taxon to another by hybridization and repeated backcrossing. This process is believed to be common in glacial refugia, where range expansions and contractions can lead to cycles of sympatry and isolation, creating conditions for extensive hybridization and introgression. Polyploidization is another genome-wide process with a major influence on plant evolution. Both hybridization and polyploidization can have complex effects on plant evolution. However, these effects are often difficult to understand in recently evolved species complexes.\n\nMethodsWe combined flow cytometry, transcriptomic and genomic analyses, and pollen-tube growth assays to investigate the consequences of polyploidization, hybridization, and introgression on the recent evolution of several Erysimum (Brassicaceae) species from the South of the Iberian Peninsula, a well-known glacial refugium. This species complex differentiated in the last 2Myr, and its evolution has been hypothesized to be determined mainly by polyploidization, interspecific hybridization, and introgression.\n\nKey ResultsOur results support a scenario of widespread hybridization involving both extant and \"ghost\" taxa. Several taxa studied here, most notably those with purple corollas, are polyploids, likely of allopolyploid origin. Moreover, hybridization in this group might be an ongoing phenomenon, as prezygotic barriers appeared weak in many cases.\n\nConclusionsThe evolution of Erysimum spp. has been determined by hybridization to a large extent. The adaptive value of such genomic exchanges remains unclear, but our results indicate the importance of hybridization for plant diversification across evolutionary scales.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Ageing is the gradual decline in organismal fitness that occurs over time leading to tissue dysfunction and disease. At the cellular level, ageing is associated with reduced function, altered gene expression and a perturbed epigenome. Somatic cell reprogramming, the process of converting somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), can reverse these age-associated changes. However, during iPSC reprogramming somatic cell identity is lost, and can be difficult to reacquire as re-differentiated iPSCs often resemble foetal rather than mature adult cells. Recent work has demonstrated that the epigenome is already rejuvenated by the maturation phase of reprogramming, which suggests full iPSC reprogramming is not required to reverse ageing of somatic cells. Here we have developed the first \"maturation phase transient reprogramming\" (MPTR) method, where reprogramming factors are expressed until this rejuvenation point followed by withdrawal of their induction. Using dermal fibroblasts from middle age donors, we found that cells reacquire their fibroblast identity following MPTR, possibly as a result of persisting epigenetic memory at enhancers. Excitingly, our method substantially rejuvenated multiple cellular attributes including the transcriptome, which was rejuvenated by around 30 years as measured by a novel transcriptome clock. The epigenome, including H3K9me3 histone methylation levels and the DNA methylation ageing clock, was rejuvenated to a similar extent. The magnitude of rejuvenation instigated by MTPR is substantially greater than that achieved in previous transient reprogramming protocols. MPTR fibroblasts produced youthful levels of collagen proteins, suggesting functional rejuvenation. Overall, our work demonstrates that it is possible to separate rejuvenation from pluripotency reprogramming, which should facilitate the discovery of novel anti-ageing genes and therapies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe developed a novel method by which human fibroblasts are reprogrammed until the maturation phase of iPSCs and are then returned to fibroblast identity\nC_LIO_LIDNA methylation memory in fibroblast enhancers may allow recovery of cell identity when fibroblast gene expression programmes are already extinct\nC_LIO_LIMolecular measures of ageing including transcriptome and DNA methylation clocks and H3K9me3 levels reveal robust and substantial rejuvenation\nC_LIO_LIFunctional rejuvenation of fibroblasts by MPTR is suggested by reacquisition of youthful levels of collagen proteins\nC_LI",

Due to the high noise incorporated in the abdominal ECG (aECG) signals, the extraction of fECG has been challenging. And it is even a lot more difficult for fECG extraction if only one channel of aECG is provided, i.e. in a compact patch device. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for non-invasive fECG extraction from a single-channel aECG signal. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, we used our own clinical data, obtained from a pilot study with 10 subjects each of 20 min recording, and data from the PhysioNet 2013 Challenge bank with labeled QRS complex annotations. The proposed methodology shows the average positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.59%, sensitivity (SE) of 96.91%, and F1-score of 97.25% from the PhysioNet 2013 Challenge bank. Our results also indicate that the proposed algorithm is reliable and effective, and it outperforms the recently proposed Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based algorithm.",

We have annotated the ten Hox genes of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, and determined that there is a split in its Hox cluster between the Deformed and Sex combs reduced genes. This is the first time a break at this position has been observed in an insect Hox cluster. We have also annotated the D. citri orthologs of the Hox cofactor genes homothorax, PKNOX and extradenticle. Interestingly, we found an additional copy of extradenticle in D. citri that appears to be a retrogene.

    "preprint_abstract": "The belowground compartment of terrestrial ecosystems drives nutrient cycling, the decomposition and stabilisation of organic matter, and supports aboveground life. Belowground consumers create complex food webs that regulate functioning, ensure stability and support biodiversity both below and above ground. However, existing soil food-web reconstructions do not match recently accumulated empirical evidence and there is no comprehensive reproducible approach that accounts for the complex resource, size and spatial structure of food webs in soil. Here I build on generic food-web organization principles and use multifunctional classification of soil protists, invertebrates and vertebrates, to reconstruct  multichannel food-web across size classes of soil-associated consumers. This reconstruction is based on overlying feeding preference, prey protection, size spectrum and spatial distribution matrices combined with biomasses of trophic guilds to infer weighted trophic interactions. I then use food-web reconstruction, together with assimilation efficiencies, to calculate energy fluxes assuming a steady-state energetic system. Based on energy fluxes, I describe a number of indicators, related to stability, biodiversity and multiple ecosystem-level functions such as herbivory, top-down control, translocation and transformation of organic matter. I illustrate the approach with an empirical example, comparing it with traditional resource-focused soil food-web reconstruction. The multichannel reconstruction can be used to assess trophic multifunctionality (analogous to ecosystem multifunctionality), i.e. simultaneous support of multiple trophic functions by the food-web, and compare it across communities and ecosystems spanning beyond the soil. With further validation and parametrization, my multichannel reconstruction approach provides an effective tool for understanding and analysing soil food webs. I believe that having this tool will inspire more people to comprehensively describe soil communities and belowground-aboveground interactions. Such studies will provide informative indicators for including consumers as active agents in biogeochemical models, not only locally but also on regional and global scales.",

A protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) and its analysis can provide insight into the behavior of cells and lead to advance the procedure of drug discovery. The identification of essential proteins is crucial to understand for cellular survival. There are many centrality measures to detect influential nodes in complex networks. Since SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs pose 553 common proteins. Analyzing influential proteins and comparing these networks together can be an effective step helping biologists in drug design.\n\nResultsWe used 21 centrality measures on SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs to identify essential proteins. PCA-based dimensionality reduction was applied on normalized centrality values. Some measures demonstrated a high level of contribution in comparison to others in both PPINs, like Barycenter, Decay, Diffusion degree, Closeness (Freeman), Closeness (Latora), Lin, Radiality, and Residual. Using validation measures, the appropriate clustering method was chosen for centrality measures. We also investigated some graph theory-based properties like the power law, exponential distribution, and robustness.\n\nConclusionsThrough analysis and comparison, both networks exhibited remarkable experimental results. The network diameters were equal and in terms of heterogeneity, SARS-CoV-2 PPIN tends to be more heterogeneous. Both networks under study display a typical power-law degree distribution. Dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning methods were so effective to reveal appropriate centrality measures.",

We also conducted codon-level analysis of our model for interpretability and biological validity of our unsupervised features.

However, effects of BEA on dendritic cells remain unknown so far. Here, we identified effects of BEA on murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-cultured bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. BEA potently activates BMDCs as signified by elevated IL-12 and CD86 expression. Multiplex immunoassays performed on myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor inducing interferon beta (TRIF) single or double deficient BMDCs indicate that BEA induces inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in a MyD88/TRIF dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that BEA was not able to induce IL-12 or IFN{beta} production in Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4)-deficient BMDCs, whereas induction of these cytokines was not compromised in Tlr3/7/9 deficient BMDCs. This suggests that TLR4 might be the functional target of BEA on BMDCs. Consistently, in luciferase reporter assays BEA stimulation significantly promotes NF-{kappa}B activation in mTLR4/CD14/MD2 overexpressing but not control HEK-293 cells. RNA-sequencing analyses further confirmed that BEA induces transcriptional changes associated with the TLR4 signaling pathway. Together, these results identify TLR4 as a cellular BEA sensor and define BEA as a potent activator of BMDCs, implying that this compound can be exploited as a promising candidate structure for vaccine adjuvants or cancer immunotherapies.",

Here, we examined antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of individuals sampled longitudinally for [~]9-10 months after the primary 2-dose mRNA vaccine series, as well as for [~]3 months after a 3rd mRNA vaccine dose. Notably, antibody decay slowed significantly between 6- and 9-months post-primary vaccination, essentially stabilizing at the time of the 3rd dose. Antibody quality also continued to improve for at least 9 months after primary 2-dose vaccination. Spike- and RBD-specific memory B cells were stable through 9 months post-vaccination with no evidence of decline over time, and [~]40-50% of RBD-specific memory B cells were capable of simultaneously recognizing the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants. Omicron-binding memory B cells induced by the first 2 doses of mRNA vaccine were boosted significantly by a 3rd dose and the magnitude of this boosting was similar to memory B cells specific for other variants. Pre-3rd dose memory B cell frequencies correlated with the increase in neutralizing antibody titers after the 3rd dose. In contrast, pre-3rd dose antibody titers inversely correlated with the fold-change of antibody boosting, suggesting that high levels of circulating antibodies may limit reactivation of immunological memory and constrain further antibody boosting by mRNA vaccines. These data provide a deeper understanding of how the quantity and quality of antibody and memory B cell responses change over time and number of antigen exposures. These data also provide insight into potential immune dynamics following recall responses to additional vaccine doses or post-vaccination infections.\n\nGraphical Summary\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481163v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@123d2d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7db82org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc73deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b21f9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "Despite their rarity in peripheral blood, basophils play important roles in allergic disorders and other diseases including sepsis and COVID-19. Existing basophil isolation methods require many manual steps and suffer from significant variability in purity and recovery. We report an integrated basophil isolation device (i-BID) in microfluidics for negative immunomagnetic selection of basophils directly from 100 L of whole blood within 10 minutes. We use a simulation-driven pipeline to design a magnetic separation module to apply an exponentially increasing magnetic force to capture magnetically tagged non-basophils flowing through a microtubing sandwiched between magnetic flux concentrators sweeping across a Halbach array. The exponential profile captures non-basophils effectively while preventing their excessive initial buildup causing clogging. The i-BID isolates basophils with a mean purity of 93.9%{+/-}3.6% and recovery of 95.6%{+/-}3.4% without causing basophil degradation or unintentional activation. Our i-BID has the potential to enable basophil-based point-of-care diagnostics such as rapid allergy assessment.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The amygdala and its connections with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) play central roles in the development of emotional processes. While several studies have suggested that this circuitry exhibits functional changes across the first two decades of life, findings have been mixed - perhaps resulting from differences in analytic choices across studies. Here we used multiverse analyses to examine the robustness of task-based amygdala-mPFC function findings to analytic choices within the context of an accelerated longitudinal design (4-22 years- old; N=98; 183 scans; 1-3 scans/participant). Participants, recruited from the greater Los Angeles area, completed an event-related emotional face (fear, neutral) task. Parallel analyses varying in preprocessing and modeling choices found that age-related change estimates for amygdala reactivity were more robust than task-evoked amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity to varied analytical choices. Specification curves indicated evidence for age-related decreases in amygdala reactivity to faces, though within-participant changes in amygdala reactivity could not be differentiated from between-participant differences. In contrast, amygdala--mPFC functional connectivity results varied across methods much more, and evidence for age-related change in amygdala-mPFC connectivity was not consistent. Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) measurements of connectivity were especially sensitive to whether a deconvolution step was applied. Our findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the robustness of findings to analysis choices, although the age-related changes in our current work cannot be overinterpreted given low test-retest reliability. Together, these findings highlight both the challenges in estimating developmental change in longitudinal cohorts and the value of multiverse approaches in developmental neuroimaging for assessing robustness of results.

Following the loss of the peptide and the light chain beta-2 microglobulin ({beta}2m), the resulting free heavy chains (FHCs) can associate into homotypic complexes in the plasma membrane. Here, we investigate the stoichiometry and dynamics of MHC-I FHCs assemblies by combining a micropattern assay with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and with single molecule co-tracking. We identify non-covalent MHC-I FHC dimers mediated by the 3 domain as the prevalent species at the plasma membrane, leading a moderate decrease in the diffusion coefficient. MHC-I FHC dimers show increased tendency to cluster into higher order oligomers as concluded from an increased immobile fraction with higher single molecule co-localization. In vitro studies with isolated proteins in conjunction with molecular docking and dynamics simulations suggest that in the complexes, the 3 domain of one FHC binds to another FHC in a manner similar to the {beta}2m light chain.\n\nSignificance StatementMHC class I molecules are cell surface transmembrane proteins with key functions in adaptive immunity against viral infections. The spatiotemporal organization of fully assembled MHC I at the cell surface and its function with respect to trans-interactions with T and NK cells has been studied in detail. By contrast, the consequences of peptide and {beta}2m dissociation yielding to formation of free heavy chains (FHC) have remained unclear. We have discovered that class I free heavy chains form distinct non-covalent dimers at the cell surface rather than non-specific clustering, and we have identified a dimerization interface mediated by the 3 domain. We propose that these non-covalent dimers are the basis of distinct signaling and endocytic sorting of MHC I FHC. This is to be explored in further work.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Diapause arrest in animals such as Caenorhabditis elegans is tightly regulated so that animals make appropriate developmental decisions amidst environmental challenges. Fully understanding diapause requires mechanistic insight of both entry and exit from the arrested state. While a steroid hormone pathway regulates the entry decision into Caenorhabditis elegans dauer diapause, its role in the exit decision is less clear. A complication to understanding steroid hormonal regulation of dauer has been the peculiar fact that steroid hormone mutants such as daf-9 form partial dauers under normal growth conditions. Here, we corroborate previous findings that daf-9 mutants remain capable of forming full dauers under unfavorable growth conditions, and we establish that the daf-9 partial dauer state is likely a partially exited dauer that has initiated but cannot complete the dauer exit decision. We show that the steroid hormone pathway is both necessary for and promotes complete dauer exit, and that the spatiotemporal dynamics of steroid hormone regulation during dauer exit resembles that of dauer entry. Overall, dauer entry and dauer exit are distinct developmental decisions that are both controlled by steroid hormone signaling.\n\nSummary StatementIn animals such as Caenorhabditis elegans, a steroid hormone pathway controls both the entry and exit decisions into and out of the developmentally arrested dauer state in response to environmental signaling.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mechanical forces associated with breathing play a fundamental role in lung development and disease but the molecular pathways remain largely unknown. Here, we used a mechanically actuatable Human Lung Alveolus Chip that recapitulates human lung alveolar type I and type II cell differentiation, alveolar-capillary interface formation, and genome-wide gene expression profiles characteristic of the distal lung to investigate the role of physical forces associated with cyclic breathing motions in lung innate immune responses to viral infection. When the mechanically active Alveolus Chips are infected with the influenza H3N2 virus, a cascade of host responses is elicited on-chip, including increased production of cytokines and expression of inflammation-associated genes in pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells, resulting in enhanced recruitment of circulating immune cells as occurs during viral infection in vivo. Surprisingly, studies carried out in parallel with static chips revealed that physiological breathing motions suppress viral replication by activating protective innate immune responses in epithelial and endothelial cells. This is mediated at least in part through upregulation of S100 calcium-binding protein A7 (S100A7), which binds to the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE), an inflammatory mediator that is most highly expressed in the lung alveolus in vivo. This mechano-immunological control mechanism is further supported by the finding that existing RAGE inhibitor drugs can suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to influenza virus infection in this model. S100A7-RAGE interactions and modulation of mechanical ventilation parameters could therefore serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention in patients infected with influenza and other potential pandemic viruses that cause life-threatening lung inflammation.",

The 0.5 MDa large TET2 aminopeptidase, a prototypical protease important for cellular homeostasis, degrades peptides within a ca. 60 [A] wide tetrahedral chamber with four lateral openings. The mechanisms of substrate trafficking and processing remain debated. Here, we integrate magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR, mutagenesis, co-evolution analysis and molecular dynamics simulations and reveal that a loop in the catalytic chamber is a key element for enzymatic function. The loop is able to stabilize ligands in the active site and may additionally have a direct role in activating the catalytic water molecule whereby a conserved histidine plays a key role. Our data provide a strong case for the functional importance of highly dynamic - and often overlooked - parts of an enzyme, and the potential of MAS NMR to investigate their dynamics at atomic resolution.",

The use of reporter constructs, cell culture and computational modeling has made enormous contributions to understanding this fundamental question, but analysis of regulatory elements in their natural developmental context is an essential but rarely used complement. Here, we edited Notch-dependent cis-regulatory elements in the endogenous C. elegans sygl-1 gene, which encodes a key stem cell regulator. We then analyzed the in vivo consequences of those mutations - on both gene expression (nascent transcripts, mRNA, protein) and stem cell maintenance. Mutation of a single element in a three-element homotypic cluster reduced expression as well as stem cell pool size by about half, while mutation of two elements essentially abolished them. We find that LBS number and LBS neighborhood are both important to activity: elements on separate chromosomes function additively, while elements in the same cluster act synergistically. Our approach of precise CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing coupled with quantitation of both molecular and biological readouts establishes a powerful model for in vivo functional analyses of DNA cis-regulatory elements.\n\nSummary statementNotch-dependent DNA cis-regulatory elements work together in their developmental context to shape a transcriptional gradient, control stem cell pool size, and govern differentiation onset.",

The Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is characterized by agenesis of the uterus and upper part of the vagina in females with normal ovarian function. Although heavily studied, the cause of the disease is still enigmatic. Current research in the field of MRKH mainly focusses on DNA-sequencing efforts and, so far, failed to decipher the nature and heterogeneity of the disease, thereby holding back scientific and clinical progress. Here, we developed long-term expandable organoid cultures from endometrium found in uterine rudiment horns of MRKH patients. Phenotypically, they share great similarity with healthy control organoids and are surprisingly fully hormone responsive. Transcriptome analyses, however, identified an array of dysregulated genes that point at potentially disease-causing pathways altered during the development of the female reproductive tract. We consider the endometrial organoid cultures to be a powerful research tool that promise to enable an array of studies into the pathogenic origins of MRKH syndrome and possible treatment opportunities to improve patient quality of life.",

We characterize micropatterned hPSCs up to 96h for the first time and show that hPGCLC populations are stable and continue to mature. By perturbing signaling during hPGCLC differentiation, we identify a previously unappreciated role for NODAL signaling and find that the relative timing and duration of BMP and NODAL signaling are critical parameters controlling the number of hPGCLCs. We formulate a mathematical model for a network of cross-repressive fates driven by NODAL and BMP signaling which predicts the measured fate patterns after signaling perturbations. Finally, we show that hPSC colony size dictates the efficiency of hPGCLC specification, which led us to dramatically improve the efficiency of hPGCLC differentiation over current protocols.",

We recently demonstrated that inhalation of CWAAP-A, one type of CWAAP, causes pulmonary disorders in rats. It is important to investigate dose-response relationships and recoverability from exposure to CWAAPs for establishing occupational health guidelines, such as setting threshold limit value for CWAAPs in the workplace.\n\nMethodsMale and female F344 rats were exposed to 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/m3 CWAAP-A for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks using a whole-body inhalation exposure system. At 1 hour, 4 weeks, and 13 weeks after the last exposure the rats were euthanized and blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and all tissues including lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes were collected and subjected to biological and histopathological analyses. In a second experiment, male rats were pre-treated with clodronate liposome or polymorphonuclear leukocyte-neutralizing antibody to deplete macrophages or neutrophils, respectively, and exposed to CWAAP-A for 6 hours/day for 2 days.\n\nResultsCWAAP-A exposure damaged only the alveoli. The lowest observed adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) was 1 mg/m3 and the no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) was 0.3 mg/m3. Rats of both sexes were able to recover from the tissue damage caused by 13 weeks exposure to 1 mg/m3 CWAAP-A. In contrast, tissue damage caused by exposure to 3 and 10 mg/m3 was irreversible due to the development of interstitial lung lesions. There was a gender difference in the recovery from CWAAP-A induced pulmonary disorders, with females recovering less than males. Finally, acute lung effects caused by CWAAP-A were significantly reduced by depletion of alveolar macrophages.\n\nConclusionsPulmonary damage caused by inhalation exposure to CWAAP-A was dose-dependent, specific to the lung and lymph nodes, and acute lung damage was ameliorated by depleting macrophages in the lungs. CWAAP-A had both a LOAEC and a NOAEC, and tissue damage caused by exposure to 1 mg/m3 CWAAP-A was reversible: recovery in female rats was less than for males. These findings indicate that concentration limits for CWAAPs in the workplace can be determined.",

However, its clinical relevance and potential mechanisms have been elusive. Here, we performed the association analyses between FAM84BAmp and clinicopathological features using our dataset with 507 ESCC samples. The results indicated that, compared with the FAM84Bnon-Amp patients, the FAM84BAmp patients showed a more aggressive and a worse prognosis. Significant correlation was discovered between the expression level of FAM84B and FAM84BAmp in ESCC cohort. Furthermore, we found that the forced expression change of FAM84B can influence ESCC cell proliferation and cell cycle status, which is probably mediated by NPM1. A direct interaction between FAM84B and the C-terminal (189-294aa) of NPM1 was identified, which increased the NPM1 nuclear expression. Over-expression of NPM1 could inhibit the CDKN2A protein expression, which might affect the ESCC cell cycle. Our results indicate FAM84B CNA may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker in ESCC, meanwhile, reveal a novel mechanism of FAM84B that it promotes tumorigenesis via interacting with NPM1 and suppressing CDKN2A.",

Selecting the optimal number of PCs is a crucial step for downstream analyses. The elbow method is most commonly used for this task, but it requires one to visually inspect the elbow plot and manually choose the elbow point. To address this limitation, we developed six methods to automatically select the optimal number of PCs based on the elbow method. We evaluated the performance of these methods on real single-cell RNA-seq data from multiple human and mouse tissues. The perpendicular line method with 20 PCs has the best overall performance, and its results are highly consistent with the numbers of PCs identified manually. We implemented the six methods in an R package, findPC, that objectively selects the number of PCs and can be easily incorporated into any automatic analysis pipeline.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationfindPC R package is freely available at https://github.com/haotian-zhuang/findPC\n\nContactzhicheng.ji@duke.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

They could potentially be used to modify or suppress pest populations, such as mosquitoes that spread diseases. CRISPR/Cas9 homing drives, which copy themselves by homology-directed repair in drive/wild-type heterozygotes, are a powerful form of gene drive, but they are vulnerable to resistance alleles that preserve the function of their target gene. Such resistance alleles can prevent successful population suppression. Here, we constructed a homing suppression drive in Drosophila melanogaster that utilized multiplexed gRNAs to inhibit the formation of functional resistance alleles in its female fertility target gene. The selected gRNA target sites were close together, preventing reduction in drive conversion efficiency. The construct reached a moderate equilibrium frequency in cage populations without apparent formation of resistance alleles. However, a moderate fitness cost prevented elimination of the cage population, showing the importance of using highly efficient drives in a suppression strategy, even if resistance can be addressed. Nevertheless, our results experimentally demonstrate the viability of the multiplexed gRNAs strategy in homing suppression gene drives.",

    "preprint_abstract": "X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a progressive adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon in the TAF1 gene. The SVA retrotransposon contains a CCCTCT hexameric repeat tract of variable length, whose length is inversely correlated with age at onset. This places XDP in a broader class of repeat expansion diseases, characterized by the instability of their causative repeat mutations. Here, we observe similar inverse correlations between CCCTCT repeat length with age at onset and age at death and no obvious correlation with disease duration. To gain insight into repeat instability in XDP we performed comprehensive quantitative analyses of somatic instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat in blood and in seventeen brain regions from affected males. Our findings reveal repeat length-dependent and expansion-based instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat, with greater levels of expansion in brain than in blood. The brain exhibits regional-specific patterns of instability that are broadly similar across individuals, with cerebellum exhibiting low instability and cortical regions exhibiting relatively high instability. The spectrum of somatic instability in the brain includes a high proportion of moderate repeat length changes of up to 5 repeats, as well as expansions of [~]20->100 repeats and contractions of [~]20-40 repeats at lower frequencies. Comparison with HTT CAG repeat instability in postmortem Huntingtons disease brains reveals similar brain region-specific profiles, indicating common trans-acting factors that contribute to the instability of both repeats. Analyses in XDP brains of expansion of a different SVA-associated CCCTCT located in the LIPG gene, and not known to be disease-associated, reveals repeat length-dependent expansion at overall lower levels relative to the XDP CCCTCT repeat, suggesting that expansion propensity may be modified by local chromatin structure. Together, the data support a role for repeat length-dependent somatic expansion in the process(es) driving the onset of XDP and prompt further investigation into repeat dynamics and the relationship to disease.",

The previous characterization of a major QTL ETHQV8.1 sufficient to trigger climacteric ripening in a non-climacteric background allowed the identification within the QTL interval of a negative regulator of ripening CmCTR1-like (MELO3C024518), and a putative DNA demethylase CmROS1 (MELO3C024516), the orthologue of DML2, a DNA demethylase regulating fruit ripening in tomato. To understand the role of these genes in climacteric ripening, we generated homozygous CRISPR knockout mutants of CmCTR1-like and CmROS1 in a climacteric genetic background. The climacteric behavior was altered in both loss-of-function mutants in two summer seasons with an advanced ethylene production profile compared to the climacteric wild type, suggesting a role of both genes in climacteric ripening in melon. Single cytosine methylome analyses of the CmROS1 knockout mutant revealed DNA methylation changes in the promoter regions of key ripening genes as ACS1, ETR1 and ACO1, and ripening associated-transcription factors as NAC-NOR, RIN and CNR, suggesting the importance of CmROS1-mediated DNA demethylation for triggering fruit ripening in melon.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Production and emigration of neural crest cells is a transient process followed by the emergence of the definitive roof plate. The mechanisms regulating the end of neural crest ontogeny are poorly understood. Whereas early crest development is stimulated by mesoderm-derived retinoic acid, we report that the end of the neural crest period is regulated by retinoic acid synthesized in the dorsal neural tube. Inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the neural tube prevents the normal upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent roof plate and prolongs the period of BMP responsiveness which otherwise ceases close to roof plate establishment. Consequently, neural crest production and emigration are extended well into the roof plate stage. In turn, extending the activity of neural crest-specific genes inhibits the onset of retinoic acid synthesis in roof plate suggesting a mutual repressive interaction between neural crest and roof plate traits. Although several roof plate-specific genes are normally expressed in the absence of retinoic acid signaling, roof plate and crest markers are co-expressed in single cells and this domain also contains dorsal interneurons. Hence, the cellular and molecular architecture of the roof plate is compromised. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neural tube-derived retinoic acid, via inhibition of BMP signaling, is an essential factor responsible for the end of neural crest generation and the proper segregation of dorsal neural lineages.",

The assay is utilized to study CRY variants with residue substitutions in the flavin pocket and correlate their TIM affinities with CTT undocking, as measured by pulse-dipolar ESR spectroscopy and evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. CRY variants with the CTT removed or undocked bind TIM constitutively, whereas those incapable of photoreduction bind TIM weakly.

In this study, we report that the GSH depleted mutants, cad2-1 and pad2-1 displayed increased sensitivity to Fe deficiency with significant down-regulation of the vacuolar Fe exporters, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 and the chloroplast Fe importer, AtPIC1. Moreover, the pad2-1 mutant accumulated higher Fe content in vacuoles and lower in chloroplasts compared with Col-0 under Fe limited condition. Exogenous GSH treatment could enhance the chloroplast Fe content in Col-0 plants but failed to do so in the nramp3nramp4 double mutant demonstrating the role of GSH in modulating subcellular Fe homeostasis. Pharmacological experiments, mutant analysis and promoter assay revealed that this regulation involved transcriptional activation of the transporter genes by a GSH-GSNO module. The Fe responsive bHLH transcription factors (TFs), AtbHLH29, AtbHLH38 and AtbHLH101 were identified to interact with the promoters of these genes which were in turn activated via S-nitrosylation.

    "preprint_abstract": "Red blood cells can withstand the harsh mechanical conditions in the vasculature only because the bending rigidity of their plasma membrane is complemented by the shear elasticity of the underlying spectrin-actin network. During an infection by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite mines host actin from the junctional complexes and establishes a system of adhesive knobs, whose main structural component is the knob-associated histidine rich protein (KAHRP) secreted by the parasite. Here we aim at a mechanistic understanding of this dramatic transformation process. We have developed a particle-based computational model for the cytoskeleton of red blood cells and simulated it with Brownian dynamics to predict the mechanical changes resulting from actin mining and KAHRP-clustering. Our simulations include the three-dimensional conformations of the semi-flexible spectrin chains, the capping of the actin protofilaments and several established binding sites for KAHRP. For the healthy red blood cell, we find that incorporation of actin protofilaments leads to two regimes in the shear response. Actin mining decreases the shear modulus, but knob formation increases it. We show that dynamical changes in KAHRP binding affinities can explain the experimentally observed relocalization of KAHRP from ankyrin to actin complexes and demonstrate good qualitative agreement with experiments by measuring pair cross-correlations both in the computer simulations and in super-resolution imaging experiments.\n\nAuthor summaryMalaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases and its symptoms are related to the blood stage, when the parasite multiplies within red blood cells. In order to avoid clearance by the spleen, the parasite produces specific factors like the adhesion receptor PfEMP1 and the multifunctional protein KAHRP that lead to the formation of adhesive knobs on the surface of the red blood cells and thus increase residence time in the vasculature. We have developed a computational model for the parasite-induced remodelling of the actin-spectrin network to quantitatively predict the dynamical changes in the mechanical properties of the infected red blood cells and the spatial distribution of the different protein components of the membrane skeleton. Our simulations show that KAHRP can relocate to actin junctions due to dynamical changes in binding affinities, in good qualitative agreement with super-resolution imaging experiments. In the future, our simulation framework can be used to gain further mechanistic insight into the way malaria parasites attack the red blood cell cytoskeleton.",

Currently most methods for studying interactions on scRNA-seq level are based on curated databases of ligands and receptors. While those methods are useful, they are limited to our current biological knowledge. Recent advances in single cell protocols have allowed for physically interacting cells to be captured and as such we have the potential to study interactions in a complimentary way without relying on prior knowledge. We introduce a new method for detecting genes that change as a result of interaction based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We apply our method to synthetic datasets to demonstrate its ability to detect genes that change in an interacting population compared to a reference population. Next, we apply our approach to two datasets of physically interacting cells and identify genes that change as a result of interaction, examples include adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules which confirm physical interaction between cells. For each dataset we produce a ranking of genes that are changing in subpopulations of the interacting cells. In addition to genes, discussed in the original publications we highlight further candidates for interaction in the top 100 and 300 ranked genes. Lastly, we apply our method to a dataset generated by a standard droplet based protocol, not designed to capture interacting cells and discuss its suitability for analysing interactions. We present a method that streamlines the detection of interactions and does not require prior clustering and generation of synthetic reference profiles to detect changes in expression.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile scRNA-seq research is a dynamic area, progress is lacking when it comes to developing methods that allow analysis of interaction that is independent of curated resources of known interacting pairs. Recent advances of sequencing protocols have allowed for interacting cells to be captured. We propose a novel method based on LDA that captures changes in gene expression as a result of interaction. Our method does not require prior information in the form of clustering or generation of synthetic reference profiles.

We use mathematical and computational modeling approaches to investigate how cultural Ne and levels of diversity depend on (1) the way traits are learned, (2) population connectedness, and (3) social network structure. We show that one-to-many and frequency-dependent transmission can temporally or permanently lower effective population size compared to census numbers. We caution that migration and cultural exchange can have counter-intuitive effects on Ne. Network density in random networks leaves Ne unchanged, scale-free networks tend to decrease and small-world networks tend to increase Ne compared to census numbers. For one-to-many transmission and different network structures, effective size and cultural diversity are closely associated. For connectedness, however, even small amounts of migration and cultural exchange result in high diversity independently of Ne. Our results highlight the importance of carefully defining effective population size for cultural systems and show that inferring Ne requires detailed knowledge about underlying cultural and demographic processes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHuman populations show immense cultural diversity and researchers have regarded population size as an important driver of cultural variation and complexity. Our approach is based on cultural evolutionary theory which applies ideas about evolution to understand how cultural traits change over time. We employ insights from population genetics about the \"effective\" size of a population (i.e. the size that matters for important evolutionary outcomes) to understand how and when larger populations can be expected to be more culturally diverse. Specifically, we provide a formal derivation for cultural effective population size and use mathematical and computational models to study how effective size and cultural diversity depend on (1) the way culture is transmitted, (2) levels of migration and cultural exchange, as well as (3) social network structure. Our results highlight the importance of effective sizes for cultural evolution and provide heuristics for empirical researchers to decide when census numbers could be used as proxies for the theoretically relevant effective numbers and when they should not.",

    "preprint_abstract": "During aging, microglia produce inflammatory factors, show reduced tissue surveillance, altered interactions with synapses, and prolonged responses to insults, positioning these cells to have profound impact on the functional integrity of nearby neurons. We and others recently showed that microglial attributes differ significantly across brain regions and CNS insults in young adult mice. However, the degree to which microglial properties vary during aging is largely unexplored. Here, we analyze and manipulate microglial aging within the basal ganglia, brain circuits that exhibit prominent regional microglial heterogeneity and where neurons are vulnerable to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease. We demonstrate that microglia in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) exhibit unique and premature responses to aging, compared to microglia elsewhere. This is associated with  pockets of VTA/SNc neuroinflammation that are likely to compromise local synaptic function as early as middle age. Surprisingly, these early aging responses of VTA and SNc microglia do not appear to be driven by systemic inflammation, local neuron death, or early responses of astrocytes to aging. Finally, CX3CR1 receptor knockout can exacerbate and microglial ablation/repopulation can suppress early VTA microglial aging; these manipulations have been shown to affect brain-wide microglial aging, and our data demonstrate that their impact is not uniform throughout the CNS. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated regional variation in the onset and magnitude of microglial aging responses and suggest that there may be important links between local microglial aging and vulnerability of nearby neurons to functional decline and disease.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) are widely used to index top-down cognitive processing in human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies. Typically, two stimuli flickering at different temporal frequencies (TFs) are presented, each producing a distinct response in the EEG at its flicker frequency. However, how SSVEP responses in EEG are modulated in the presence of a competing flickering stimulus just due to sensory interactions is not well understood. We have previously shown in local field potentials (LFP) recorded from awake monkeys that when two overlapping full screen gratings are counter-phased at different TFs, there is an asymmetric SSVEP response suppression, with greater suppression from lower TFs, which further depends on the relative orientations of the gratings (stronger suppression and asymmetry for parallel compared to orthogonal gratings). Here, we first confirmed these effects in both male and female human EEG recordings. Then, we mapped the response suppression of one stimulus (target) by a competing stimulus (mask) over a much wider range than the previous study. Surprisingly, we found that the suppression was not stronger at low frequencies in general, but systematically varied depending on the target TF, indicating local interactions between the two competing stimuli. These results were confirmed in both human EEG and monkey LFP and electrocorticogram (ECoG) data. Our results show that sensory interactions between multiple SSVEPs are more complex than shown previously and are influenced by both local and global factors, underscoring the need to cautiously interpret the results of studies involving SSVEP paradigms.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Aversive responses to bright light (photoaversion) require signaling from the eye to the brain. Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) encode absolute light intensity and are thought to provide the light signals for photoaversion. Consistent with this, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion prior to the developmental onset of image vision, and melanopsin deletion abolishes photoaversion in neonates. It is not well understood how the population of ipRGCs, which constitutes multiple physiologically distinct types (denoted M1-M6 in mouse) encodes light stimuli to produce an aversive response. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that M1 ipRGCs that lack the Brn3b transcription factor drive photoaversion in neonatal mice. First, neonatal mice lacking TRPC6 and TRPC7 ion channels failed to turn away from bright light, while two photon Ca2+ imaging of their acutely isolated retinas revealed reduced photosensitivity in M1 ipRGCs, but not other ipRGC types. Second, mice in which all ipRGC types except for Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs are ablated, exhibited normal photoaversion. Third, pharmacological blockade or genetic knockout of gap junction channels expressed by ipRGCs, which reduces the light sensitivity of M2-M6 ipRGCs in the neonatal retina, had small effects on photoaversion only at the brightest light intensities. Finally, M1s were not strongly depolarized by spontaneous retinal waves, a robust source of activity in the developing retina that depolarizes all other ipRGC types. M1s therefore constitute a separate information channel between the neonatal retina and brain that could ensure behavioral responses to light but not spontaneous retinal waves.",

Current hypotheses suggest that herbivore consumption and impact on plants should scale positively with plant resource availability. However, depending on the effect of resources on plant quantity and quality, herbivore impact may vary with different types of resources. We test four alternative hypotheses for the relationship between plant biomass, herbivore impact on plant biomass, and plant resource gradients, each based on how resources might affect plant abundance and quality to herbivores. We measured plant biomass for four non-consecutive years in a long-term grazing exclosure experiment in the Serengeti National Park that includes seven sites that vary substantially in rainfall and soil and plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our data supported the hypothesis that herbivore impact is controlled by plant quality, in this case driven by plant P, as herbivore effects on biomass decreased with higher rainfall but increased with greater plant P, but not N content. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to indicate that wild mammalian herbivory is associated with P availability rather than N. Our results suggest that P, in addition to water and N, may play a more important role in driving trophic interactions in terrestrial systems than previously realized.",

These rearrangements may promote biotic diversification by facilitating episodic allopatry and secondary contact among populations. We sequenced genome-wide markers to evaluate histories of divergence and introgression in six Amazonian avian species-complexes. We first tested the assumption that rivers are barriers for these taxa and found that even relatively small rivers facilitate divergence. We then tested whether species diverged with gene flow and recovered reticulate histories for all species, including one potential case of hybrid speciation. Our results support the hypothesis that river dynamics promote speciation and reveal that many rainforest taxa are micro-endemic, unrecognized and thus threatened with imminent extinction. We propose that Amazonian hyper-diversity originates in part from fine-scale barrier displacement processes -including river dynamics- which allow small populations to differentiate and disperse into secondary contact.",

Inspired by developing biological systems, which efficiently extract positional information from chemical morphogen gradients in the presence of environmental uncertainties, we here investigate the analogous question: how well can a synthetic cell determine its position within a synthetic multicellular structure? In order to calculate positional information in such systems, we created and analyzed a large number of replicas of synthetic cellular assemblies, which were composed of emulsion droplets connected via lipid bilayer membranes. The droplets contained cell-free two-node feedback gene circuits that responded to gradients of a genetic inducer acting as a morphogen. We found that in our system, simple anterior-posterior differentiation is possible, but positional information is limited by gene expression noise, and is also critically affected by the temporal evolution of the morphogen gradient and the life-time of the cell-free expression system contained in the synthetic cells. Using a 3D printing approach, we demonstrate morphogen-based differentiation also in larger tissue-like assemblies.",

Therefore, cancer cells are considered to be sensitive to drugs that exacerbate the level of RS or block the intra S-phase checkpoint. Consequently, RS-inducing drugs including ATR and CHK1 inhibitors are used or evaluated as anti-cancer therapies. However, drug resistance and lack of biomarkers predicting therapeutic efficacy limit efficient use. This raises the question what determines sensitivity of individual cancer cells to RS. Here, we report that oncogenic RAS does not only enhance the sensitivity to ATR/CHK1 inhibitors by directly causing RS. Instead, we observed that HRASG12V dampens the activation of the P53-dependent transcriptional response to drug-induced RS, which in turn confers sensitivity to RS. We demonstrate that inducible expression of HRASG12V sensitized retina pigment epithelial (RPE-hTERT) as well as osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells to ATR and CHK1 inhibitors. Using RNA-sequencing of FACS-sorted cells we discovered that P53 signaling is the sole transcriptional response to RS. However, oncogenic RAS attenuates the transcription of P53 and its target genes. Accordingly, live cell imaging showed that HRASG12V exacerbates RS in S/G2-phase, which could be rescued by stabilization of P53. Thus, our results demonstrate that transcriptional control of P53 is a prime determinant in the response to ATR/CHK1 inhibitors and show that hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway impedes this response. Our findings suggest that the level of oncogenic MAPK signaling could predict sensitivity to intra-S-phase inhibition in cancers with intact P53.",

The application of genome sequencing in patients has recently allowed many new discoveries with over 50 disease causing loci known to date. There are several tools which allow genotyping of STRs from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. However, running these tools out of the box only allow around half of the known disease-causing loci to be genotyped, with lengths often limited to either read or fragment length which is less than the pathogenic cut-off for some diseases. While analysis tools can be customised to genotype extra loci, this requires proficiency in bioinformatics to set up, use, and analyse the resulting data, limiting their widespread usage by other researchers and clinicians.\n\nTo address these issues, we have created a new software called STRipy that has an intuitive graphical interface and requires no specific skills for usage, thus significantly simplifying detection of STRs expansions from human HTS data. STRipy is able to target all known disease-causing STRs with genotyping performed with an established tool, ExpansionHunter, that is incorporated into the software. We have created additional functionality into STRipy to work with long alleles exceeding the fragment length.\n\nSTRipy was validated using over 60 thousand simulated samples and was shown to work on whole genome sequencing of biological samples with pathogenic variants. Finally, we have used STRipy to acquire genotypes of pathogenic loci for thousands of samples from various populations which are provided to the user along with the data from the literature to assist with results interpretation. We believe the simplicity and breadth of STRipy will increase the testing of STR diseases in current datasets resulting in further diagnoses of rare diseases caused by STRs expansions.",

The synaptic signaling pathways that mediate the restorative benefits of sleep are not fully understood, particularly in the context of development. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) including 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), are bioactive lipids that activate cannabinoid receptor, CB1, to regulate synaptic transmission and mediate cognitive functions and many behaviors, including sleep. We used targeted mass spectrometry to measure changes in forebrain synaptic eCBs during the sleep/wake cycle in developing and adult mice. We find that eCBs are downregulated in response to acute sleep deprivation in juvenile mice, while in young adults eCBs are upregulated during the sleep phase in a circadian manner. Next we manipulated the eCB system using selective pharmacology and measured the effects on sleep behavior in developing and adult mice of both sexes using a non-invasive piezoelectric home-cage recording apparatus. Enhancement of eCB signaling through inhibition of 2-AG or AEA degradation, increased dark phase sleep amount and bout length in developing and adult males, but not in females. Inhibition of CB1 by injection of the antagonist AM251 reduced sleep time and caused sleep fragmentation in developing and adult males and females. Our data suggest that males are more sensitive to the sleep promoting effects of enhanced eCBs but that tonic eCB signaling supports sleep behavior through multiple stages of development in both sexes.

By using graph attention networks to exploit the connectivity of distal elements up to 2Mb away in the genome, GraphReg more faithfully models gene regulation and more accurately predicts gene expression levels than state-of-the-art deep learning methods for this task. Feature attribution used with GraphReg accurately identifies functional enhancers of genes, as validated by CRISPRi-FlowFISH and TAP-seq assays, outperforming both CNNs and the recently proposed Activity-by-Contact model.

Often, these factors act together to cause sex differences in specific phenotypes, but the relative contribution of each and the interactions among them remain unclear. Here, we used the Four Core Genotypes (FCG) mouse model with or without hormone replacement to distinguish the effects of each class of sex-biasing factors on transcriptome regulation in liver and adipose tissues. We found that the activational hormone levels have the strongest influence on gene expression, followed by the organizational gonadal sex effect and, lastly, sex chromosomal effect, along with interactions among the three factors. Tissue specificity was prominent, with a major impact of estradiol on adipose tissue gene regulation, and of testosterone on the liver transcriptome. The networks affected by the three sex-biasing factors include development, immunity and metabolism, and tissue-specific regulators were identified for these networks. Furthermore, the genes affected by individual sex-biasing factors and interactions among factors are associated with human disease traits such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. Our study offers a tissue-specific account of the individual and interactive contributions of major sex-biasing factors to gene regulation that have broad impact on systemic metabolic, endocrine, and immune functions.",

At a systems level, however, the underlying neural circuitry is not well defined. Rodent fear conditioning (FC) provides a translational model to study the networks underlying associative memory retrieval. In the current study, functional connectivity among regions related to the cue associative fear network were investigated using functional ultrasound (fUS), a novel imaging technique with great potential for detecting regional neural activity through cerebral blood flow. Behavioral fear expression and fUS imaging were performed one and thirty-one days after FC to assess recent and remote memory recall. Cue-evoked increases in functional connectivity were detected throughout the amygdala, with the lateral (LA) and central (CeA) amygdalar nuclei emerging as major hubs of connectivity, though CeA connectivity was reduced during remote recall. The hippocampus and sensory cortical regions displayed heightened connectivity with the LA during remote recall, whereas interconnectivity between the primary auditory cortex and temporal association areas was reduced. Subregions of the prefrontal cortex exhibited variable connectivity changes, where prelimbic connectivity with the amygdala was refined while specific connections between the infralimbic cortex and amygdalar subregions emerged during remote memory retrieval. Moreover, freezing behavior positively correlated with functional connectivity between hubs of the associative fear network, suggesting that emotional response intensity reflected the strength of the cue-evoked functional network. Overall, our data provide evidence of the functionality of fUS imaging to investigate the neural dynamics of memory encoding and retrieval, applicable in the development of innovative treatments for affective disorders.\n\nHighlightsFunctional ultrasound imaging can elucidate fear associated neural networks\n\nFreezing behavior correlates with cue-evoked functional connectivity changes\n\nThe lateral and central amygdalar nuclei are major hubs in the fear network\n\nThe hippocampus is active during recent and remote cued fear memory retrieval\n\nConnectivity profiles of the prelimbic and infralimbic areas vary in remote recall",

    "preprint_abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis due to its aggressive progression, late detection and lack of druggable driver mutations, which often combine to result in unsuitability for surgical intervention. Together with activating mutations of the small GTPase KRas, which are found in over 90% of PDAC tumours, a contributory factor for PDAC tumour progression is formation of a rigid extracellular matrix (ECM) and associated desmoplasia. This response leads to aberrant integrin signalling, and accelerated proliferation and invasion. To identify the integrin adhesion systems that operate in PDAC, we analysed a range of pancreatic ductal epithelial cell models using 2D, 3D and organoid culture systems. Proteomic analysis of isolated integrin receptor complexes from human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells predominantly identified integrin 6{beta}4 and hemidesmosome components, rather than classical focal adhesion components. Electron microscopy, together with immunofluorescence, confirmed the formation of hemidesmosomes by HPDE cells, both in 2D and 3D culture systems. Similar results were obtained for the human PDAC cell line, SUIT-2. Analysis of HPDE cell secreted proteins and cell-derived matrices (CDM) demonstrated that HPDE cells secrete a range of laminin subunits and form a hemidesmosome-specific, laminin 332-enriched ECM. Expression of mutant KRas (G12V) did not affect hemidesmosome composition or formation by HPDE cells. Cell-ECM contacts formed by mouse and human PDAC organoids were also assessed by electron microscopy. Organoids generated from both the PDAC KPC mouse model and human patient-derived PDAC tissue displayed features of acinar-ductal cell polarity, and hemidesmosomes were visible proximal to prominent basement membranes. Furthermore, electron microscopy identified hemidesmosomes in normal human pancreas. Depletion of integrin {beta}4 using siRNA reduced cell proliferation in both SUIT-2 and HPDE cells, reduced the number of SUIT-2 cells in S-phase, and induced G1 cell cycle arrest, indicating a requirement for 6{beta}4-mediated adhesion for cell cycle progression and growth. Taken together, these data suggest that laminin-binding adhesion mechanisms in general, and hemidesmosome-mediated adhesion in particular, may be under-appreciated in the context of PDAC.\n\nProteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifiers PXD027803, PXD027823 and PXD027827.",

Predictable environmental changes such as seasonal variation in photoperiod can modulate circadian rhythms, allowing organisms to adjust to the time of the year. Modification of circadian clocks is especially relevant in crops to enhance their cultivability in specific regions by changing their sensibility to photoperiod. In tomato, the appearance of mutations in EMPFINDLICHER IM DUNKELROTEN LICHT 1 (EID1, Solyc09g075080) and NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED GENE 2 (LNK2, Solyc01g068560) during domestication delayed its circadian rhythms, and allowed its expansion outside its equatorial origin. Here we study how variation in circadian rhythms in tomato affects its perception of photoperiod. To do this, we create near isogenic lines carrying combinations of wild alleles of EID1 and LNK2 and perform transcriptomic profiling under two different photoperiods. We observe that EID1, but not LNK2, has a large effect on the tomato transcriptome and its response to photoperiod. This large effect of EID1 is likely a consequence of the global phase shift elicited by this gene in tomatos circadian rhythms.",

Comparing assemblies of Illumina, ONT and an Illumina-ONT hybrid revealed the hybrid to be the  best assembly, comprising 163 Mbp in 63,555 scaffolds (N50: 3,084). This assembly, however, was still highly fragmented and only contained 52% of core metazoan genes (with 77.9% partial genes), so it was also not complete.\n\nHowever, this sponge is an emerging model species for field and laboratory work, and there is considerable interest in genomic sequencing of this species. Although the resultant assemblies from the data presented here are suboptimal, this data note can inform future studies by providing an estimated genome size and coverage requirements for future sequencing, sharing additional data to potentially improve other suboptimal assemblies of this species, and outlining potential limitations and pitfalls of the combined Illumina and ONT approach to novel genome sequencing.",

CLE family peptides are plant-specific peptide hormones that regulate various developmental processes. However, the role of CLE in regulating leaf senescence remains unclear. Here, we found that CLE42 is a negative regulator of leaf senescence by using a CRISPR/Cas9-produced CLE mutant collection. The cle42 mutant displayed earlier senescence phenotypes, while overexpression of CLE42 delayed age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence. Moreover, application of the synthesized 12-aa peptide (CLE42p) also delayed leaf senescence under natural and dark conditions. CLE42 and CLE41/44 displayed functional redundancy in leaf senescence, and the cle41 cle42 cle44 triple mutant displayed more pronounced earlier senescence phenotypes than any single mutant. Analysis of differentially expressed genes obtained by RNA-Seq methodology revealed that ethylene pathway was suppressed by overexpressing CLE42. Moreover, CLE42 suppressed ethylene biosynthesis and thus promoted the protein accumulation of EBF, which in turn decreased the function of EIN3. Accordingly, mutation of EIN3/EIL1 or overexpression of EBF1 suppressed the earlier senescence phenotypes of the cle42 mutant. Together, our results reveal that the CLE peptide hormone regulates leaf senescence by communicating with ethylene pathway.",

Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) has recently received considerable interest by virtue of its ability to discriminate cells by their intracellular chemical content, in a label-free manner. However, broad deployment of RACS beyond lab-based demonstrations is hindered by a fundamental trade-off between throughput and measurement bandwidth (i.e., cellular information content). Here we overcome this trade-off and demonstrate broadband RACS in the fingerprint region (300 - 1,600 cm-1) with a record high throughput of ~50 cells per second. This represents a 100x throughput increase compared to previous demonstrations of broadband fingerprint-region RACS. To show the utility of our RACS, we demonstrate real-time label-free sorting of microalgal cells based on their accumulation of carotenoids and polysaccharide granules. These results hold promise for medical, biofuel, and bioplastic applications.",

Delivery of constitutively active STAT5 (STAT5CA) to male mouse liver using an engineered adeno-associated virus with high tropism for the liver is shown to induce widespread feminization of the liver, with extensive induction of female-biased genes and repression of male-biased genes, largely mimicking results obtained when male mice are given GH as a continuous infusion. Many of the gene expression changes observed were associated with STAT5 binding to liver chromatin, supporting the proposed direct role of persistently active STAT5 in continuous GH-induced liver feminization. The feminizing effects of STAT5CA were dose-dependent; moreover, at higher levels, overexpression of STAT5CA resulted in some histopathology not seen in continuous GH-infused male liver, including hepatocyte hyperplasia and distorted liver architecture. These findings establish that the persistent activation of STAT5 by GH that characterizes female liver is by itself sufficient to account for the female-biased expression of a majority of female-biased genes. Moreover, histological changes seen when STAT5CA is overexpressed highlight the importance of carefully evaluating such effects before considering such STAT5 derivatives for therapeutic use in treating liver disease.",

Baroreceptor feedback is an essential component of this system acting on different time scales from maintaining stable levels of cardiovascular parameters on the long-term to rapid alterations according to behavior. The baroreceptor input is essentially rhythmic, reflecting periodic fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. Cardiac rhythm is a prominent feature of the autonomic control system, present on different levels, including neuron activity in central circuits. The mechanism of rhythmic entrainment of neuron firing by the baroreceptor input was studied in great detail under anesthesia but recordings of sympathetic-related neuron firing in freely moving animals remain extremely scarce. In this study we recorded multiple single neuron activity in the reticular formation of the medulla in freely moving rats during natural behavior. Neurons firing in synchrony with the cardiac rhythm were detected in each experiment (n=4). In agreement with prior observations in anesthetized cats, we found that neurons in this area exhibited high neuron-to-neuron variability and temporal flexibility in their coupling to cardiac rhythm in freely moving rats, as well. This included firing in bursts at multiples of cardiac cycles, but not directly coupled to the heartbeat, supporting the concept of baroreceptor input entraining intrinsic neural oscillations rather than imposing a rhythm of solely external origin on these networks. It may also point to a mechanism of maintaining the basic characteristics of sympathetic neuron activity, i.e. burst-discharge and cardiac-related rhythmicity, on the background of behavior-related adjustments in their firing rate.",

Of the known herbicide modes of action, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin synthase (DHPS) which is involved in folate biosynthesis, is targeted by just one commercial herbicide, asulam. A mimic of the substrate para-aminobenzoic acid, asulam is chemically similar to sulfonamide antibiotics - and while still in widespread use, asulam has faced regulatory scrutiny. With an entire mode of action represented by just one commercial agrochemical, we sought to improve the understanding of its plant target. Here we solve a 2.6 [A] resolution crystal structure for Arabidopsis thaliana DHPS that is conjoined to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) and reveal a strong structural conservation with bacterial counterparts at the sulfonamide-binding pocket of DHPS. We demonstrate asulam and the antibiotics sulfacetamide and sulfamethoxazole have herbicidal as well as antibacterial activity and explore the structural basis of their potency by modelling these compounds in mitochondrial HPPK/DHPS. Our findings suggest limited opportunity for the rational design of plant selectivity from asulam and that pharmacokinetic or delivery differences between plants and microbes might be the best approaches to safeguard this mode of action.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Evaluation of the efficacy of management actions to control invasive species is crucial for maintaining funding and to provide feedback for the continual improvement of management efficiency. However, it is often difficult to assess the efficacy of control methods due to limited resources for monitoring. Many managers view effort on monitoring as effort taken away from performing management actions. We developed a method to estimate invasive species abundance, evaluate management effectiveness, and evaluate population growth overtime from a combination of removal activities (e.g., aerial gunning, trapping, ground shooting) using only data collected during removal efforts (the method of removal, the date, location, number of animals removed, and the effort). This dynamic approach allows for estimating abundance at discrete time points and the estimation of population growth between removal periods. We applied this method to removal data from Mingo National Wildlife Refuge in Missouri from December 2015 to September 2019, where the management objective is elimination. Populations of feral swine on Mingo NWR have fluctuated over time but showed more marked declines in the last 3-6 months of the time series. More dramatic declines were observed in the center of the refuge likely aided by reducing potential immigration from the rest of the refuge. To counteract population growth (from both births and immigration) the percent of the population of feral swine removed monthly must be greater than the growth rate. On average, we found that removing 10% of the population monthly had only a 50% chance of causing a population decline, whereas removing 15% of the population monthly had a 95% chance of causing a population decline. Our method provides advancement over traditional removal modeling approaches because it can be applied to evaluate management programs that use a broad range of removal techniques concurrently and whose management effort and spatial coverage vary across time.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The residual reduction algorithm (RRA) in OpenSim is designed to improve dynamic consistency of kinematics and ground reaction forces in movement simulations of musculoskeletal models. RRA requires the user to select numerous tracking weights for the joint kinematics to reduce residual errors. Selection is often performed manually, which can be time-consuming and is unlikely to yield optimal tracking weights. A multi-heuristic optimization algorithm was used to expedite tracking weight decision making to reduce residual errors. This method produced more rigorous results than manual iterations and although the total computation time was not significantly reduced, this method does not require the user to monitor the algorithms progress to find a solution, thereby reducing manual tuning. Supporting documentation and code to implement this optimization is freely provided to assist the community with developing movement simulations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas that display complex molecular and genetic alterations. Powerful tumor suppressors CDKN2A and TP53 are commonly disrupted in these lesions along with NF1, a gene that encodes a negative regulator of Ras. Many additional factors have been implicated in MPNST pathogenesis. A greater understanding of critical drivers of the disease is needed to guide more informed targeted therapies for patients. RABL6A is a newly identified driver of MPNST cell survival and proliferation whose in vivo role in the disease is unknown.\n\nMethodsUsing CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of Nf1+Cdkn2a or Nf1+Tp53 in the sciatic nerve to form de novo MPNSTs, we investigated the biological significance of RABL6A in MPNST development. Molecular evaluation of terminal tumors (western blot, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry) yielded several insights.\n\nResultsMice lacking Rabl6 displayed slower tumor growth and extended survival relative to wildtype animals in both genetic contexts. YAP oncogenic activity was selectively downregulated in RABL6A-null, Nf1+Cdkn2a lesions but not in RABL6A-null, Nf1+Tp53 tumors. Regardless of genetic context, loss of RABL6A caused upregulation of the CDK inhibitor, p27 in tumors. Paradoxically, both models displayed elevated Myc protein expression and Ki67 staining in terminal tumors lacking RABL6A.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate RABL6A is required for optimal tumor progression of NF1 mutant MPNSTs in vivo in both Cdkn2a and p53 inactivated settings. However, sustained RABL6A loss may provide selective pressure for molecular alterations, such as Myc upregulation, that ultimately promote an unwanted, hyper-proliferative tumor phenotype akin to drug resistant lesions.\n\nImportance of the StudyMPNSTs are aggressive, deadly, and challenging to treat tumors due to location around nerves and high mutational burden. Many factors implicated in MPNST genesis have yet to be fully tested for biological significance in disease formation. We establish a critical physiological role for a new oncoprotein, RABL6A, in promoting NF1-associated MPNST progression. We identify novel RABL6A-regulated pathways that likely contribute to tumor growth, specifically YAP and Myc signaling, and found that sustained RABL6A loss eventually yields more proliferative tumors. We liken RABL6A deficient tumors to those being treated with therapies targeting RABL6A effectors, such as CDKs. Therefore, those lesions should provide a powerful platform to uncover key mediators of drug resistance. Our data suggest oncogenic YAP and Myc could be such mediators of resistance. This study provides a novel system to examine one of the most pressing clinical challenges, drug resistant tumor growth and relapse, in cancer therapy.",

Several lines of evidence pointed to RNAP II as the enzyme producing them. We now show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, permanently switched to RNAP II, due to deletion part of RNAP I upstream activator alone or in combination with deletion of one component of RNAP I itself, the production of such 18S and 25S rRNAs. They contain multiple phosphates at their 5-end and an anti-cap specific antibody binds to them indicating capping of these molecules. These molecules are found in RNA isolated from nuclei, therefore are unlikely to be capped in the cytoplasm. This would be unlike recapping of decapped mRNAs which occurs in the cytoplasm. Our data confirm the existence of such molecules and firmly establish RNA II playing a role in their production. The fact that we see these molecules in wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicates that they are not only a result of mutations but are part of the cells physiology. This adds another way RNAP II is involved in ribosome production in addition to their role in the production of ribosome associated proteins.",

However, the physiological mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression are not well-known. The length of telomeres, the DNA sequences protecting chromosome ends, has been associated with health or fitness in several species. We investigated effects of inbreeding on early-life telomere length in two small island populations of wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) known to be affected by inbreeding depression. Using genomic and pedigree-based measures of inbreeding we found that inbred nestling house sparrows have shorter telomeres. This negative effect of inbreeding on telomere length may have been complemented by a heterosis effect resulting in longer telomeres in individuals that were less inbred than the population average. Furthermore, we found some evidence of stronger effects of inbreeding on telomere length in males than females. Thus, telomere length may reveal subtle costs of inbreeding in the wild and demonstrate a route by which inbreeding negatively impacts the physiological state of an organism already at early life-history stages.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The use of computational techniques to analyze viral sequence data and ultimately inform public health intervention has become increasingly common in the realm of epidemiology. These methods typically attempt to make epidemiological inferences based on multiple sequence alignments and phylogenies estimated from the raw sequence data. Like all estimation techniques, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference tools are error-prone, and the impacts of such imperfections on downstream epidemiological inferences are poorly understood. To address this, we executed multiple commonly-used workflows for conducting viral phylogenetic analyses on simulated viral sequence data modeling HIV, HCV, and Ebola, and we computed multiple methods of accuracy motivated by transmission clustering techniques. For multiple sequence alignment, MAFFT consistently outperformed MUSCLE and Clustal Omega in both accuracy and runtime. For phylogenetic inference, FastTree 2, IQ-TREE, RAxML-NG, and PhyML had similar topological accuracies, but branch lengths and pairwise distances were consistently most accurate in phylogenies inferred by RAxML-NG. However, FastTree 2 was orders of magnitude faster than the other tools, and when the other tools were used to optimize branch lengths along a fixed topology provided by FastTree 2 (i.e., no tree search), the resulting phylogenies had accuracies that were indistinguishable from their original counterparts, but with a fraction of the runtime. Our results indicate that an ideal workflow for viral phylogenetic inference is to (1) use MAFFT to perform MSA, (2) use FastTree 2 under the GTR model with discrete gamma-distributed site-rate heterogeneity to quickly obtain a reasonable tree topology, and (3) use RAxML-NG to optimize branch lengths along the fixed FastTree 2 topology.",

Nearly all HGSC cases are diagnosed at late stage and it is not clear whether early stage HGSC has unique characteristics compared to late stage tumours.\n\nExperimental DesignWe analysed samples from 45 patients with FIGO stage I - IIA HGSC - 40 from the pathology archives of three large UK cancer centres and 5 from the BriTROC-1 study. We performed shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) and targeted next generation sequencing to investigate somatic mutations and copy number alterations. We compared results to 51 stage IIIC/IV HGSC patients from the BriTROC-1 study.\n\nResultsThere was no difference in median age between the early stage (median 61.3 years, range 40-84) and late stage (median 62.3 years, range 34-76) patients at diagnosis. TP53 mutations were near-universal (92% early stage, 100% late stage samples) and there were no significant differences in the rates of other somatic mutations, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, or focal copy number alterations between early- and late-stage cohorts. There were also no unique amplifications or deletions in either cohort. However, median ploidy was greater in late stage (median 3.1) than early stage (median 2.0) samples. In addition, there were higher numbers of breakpoints per 10MB and per chromosome arm and higher absolute copy number in late stage than early stage cohorts; early stage samples had longer segment length. Overall copy number signature exposures were significantly different between early and late stage samples with greater signature 3 exposure in early stage and greater signature 4 in late stage. Both simplex plot and unsupervised hierarchical clustering suggested that a subset of late stage samples retain early stage appearances with high signature 3 and co-clustering with the early stage samples\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that there are no unique mutations or focal copy number alterations in early stage HGSC. However, whole genome duplication is significantly more common in late-stage disease, suggesting evolution during disease progression. However, a subset of late stage HGSC retains early-stage features, which are associated with improved overall survival.",

Whereas examples of each mechanism have been documented, systematic tests of the role of SVs in speciation are lacking. Here, we take advantage of long-read (Oxford nanopore) whole-genome sequencing and a hybrid zone between two Lycaeides butterfly taxa (L. melissa and Jackson Hole Lycaeides) to comprehensively evaluate genome-wide patterns of introgression for SVs and relate these patterns to hypotheses about speciation. We found >100,000 SVs segregating within or between the two hybridizing species. SVs and SNPs exhibited similar levels of genetic differentiation between species, with the exception of inversions, which were more differentiated. We detected credible variation in patterns of introgression among SV loci in the hybrid zone, with 562 of 1419 ancestry-informative SVs exhibiting genomic clines that deviating from null expectations based on genome-average ancestry. Overall, hybrids exhibited a directional shift towards Jackson Hole Lycaeides ancestry at SV loci, consistent with the hypothesis that these loci experienced more selection on average then SNP loci. Surprisingly, we found that deletions, rather than inversions, showed the highest skew towards excess introgression from Jackson Hole Lycaeides. Excess Jackson Hole Lycaeides ancestry in hybrids was also especially pronounced for Z-linked SVs and inversions containing many genes. In conclusion, our results show that SVs are ubiquitous and suggest that SVs in general, but especially deletions, might contribute disproportionately to hybrid fitness and thus (partial) reproductive isolation.",

How TF duplicates diverge is known for only a few studied cases. To provide a genome-scale view, we considered the 35% of budding yeast TFs, classified as whole-genome duplication (WGD)-retained paralogs. Using high-resolution profiling, we find that ~60% of paralogs evolved differential binding preferences. We show that this divergence results primarily from variations outside the DNA binding domains (DBDs), while DBD preferences remain largely conserved. Analysis of non-WGD orthologs revealed that ancestral preferences are unevenly split between duplicates, while new targets are acquired preferentially by the least conserved paralog (biased sub/neo-functionalization). Dimer-forming paralogs evolved mostly one-sided dependency, while other paralogs interacted through low-magnitude DNA-binding competition that minimized paralog interference. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolutionary design of transcriptional networks.",

EDCs are ubiquitous and can be found in a variety of consumer products such as food packaging materials, personal care and household products, plastic additives, and flame retardants. Over the last decade, the impact of EDCs on human health has been widely acknowledged as they have been associated with different endocrine diseases. Among them, a subset called metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) are able to promote metabolic changes that can lead to the development of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome, among others. Despite this, today, there are still no definitive and standardized in vitro tools to support the metabolic risk assessment of existing and emerging MDCs for regulatory purposes. Here, we evaluated two different pancreatic cell-based in vitro systems, the murine pancreatic {beta}-cell line MIN6 as well as the human pancreatic {beta}-cell line EndoC- {beta}H1. Both were challenged with a range of relevant concentrations of seven well-known EDCs (bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), bisphenol-F (BPF), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)). The screening revealed that most of the tested chemicals have detectable deleterious effects on glucose-stimulated insulin release, insulin content, electrical activity, gene expression, and/or viability. Our data provide new molecular information on the direct effects of the selected chemicals on key aspects of pancreatic {beta}-cell function such as the stimulus-secretion coupling and ion channel activity. In addition, we found that, in general, the sensitivity and responses were comparable to those from other in vivo studies reported in the literature. Overall, our results suggest that both systems can serve as effective tools for rapid screening of potential MDC effects on pancreatic {beta}-cell physiology as well for deciphering and better understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie their action.",

The incidence rate increases significantly every year, from 0.05 per 100.000 inhabitants in 1968 to 35-40 per 100.000 inhabitants in 2013. Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia are the most commonly reported changes, whether they are caused by bone marrow suppression or peripheral destruction. Anemia has also been observed to occur in dengue infection with unknown mechanism. Immature Reticulocyte Fraction (IRF) is a parameter reflecting the most immature reticulocyte fraction and it can identify the earliest stage of erythropoiesis disorder. This research aimed to determine the mechanism of erythropoiesis disorders that led to anemia using IRF parameter in the various clinical phases of dengue fever. This study was a comparative analytical research using secondary data derived from the Dengue-associated Endothelial Cell Dysfunction and Thrombocyte Activation (DECENT) research. The baseline characteristic data consists of sex, age, level of hemoglobin, hematocrit, leucocyte, and thrombocyte, also the IRF. The patients were grouped into the fever, critical, recovery, and convalescent phases, plus healthy control group. The data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, followed by Friedman test and Mann-Whitney post hoc test. There were 244 research subjects and the median age was 24 (14-67), with similar ratio of male and female. The median IRF for all the research subjects was 4.8% with an IQR of 2.4-8.1%. The fever-phase group showed a median of 1.8% with an IQR of 0.5-2.85%. The critical-phase group showed a median of 3.6% with an IQR of 1.8- 5.0%, while the median for the recovery-phase group was 7.05% with an IQR of 4.08-11.85%. The convalescent-phase group showed a median of 7.3 % with an IQR of 3.95-9.3%, and the healthy-control group showed a median of 4.1% with an IQR of 2.2-6.6%. There was a significant difference in IRF between the groups (p<0.05). Immature Reticulocyte Fraction in fever phase was significantly different with IRF in other phases and healthy controls (p<0.05). In the critical phase, IRF was not significantly different from the healthy controls (p=0.218). Summarizing, there are changes in erythropoiesis activity in various clinical phases of dengue infection. Erythropoiesis suppression occurred mainly during the fever phase and it started to restore in the critical phase. In the recovery and convalescent phases, the erythropoiesis activity was increased.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Intracellular processes depend on a strict spatial and temporal organization of proteins and organelles. Directly linking molecular to nanoscale ultrastructural information is therefore crucial to understand cellular physiology. Volume or 3-dimensional (3D) correlative light and electron microscopy (volume-CLEM) holds unique potential to explore cellular physiology at high-resolution ultrastructural detail across cell volumes. Application of volume-CLEM is however hampered by limitations in throughput and 3D correlation efficiency. Addressing these limitations, we here describe a novel pipeline for volume-CLEM that provides high-precision (<100nm) registration between 3D fluorescence microscopy (FM) and 3D electron microscopy (EM) data sets with significantly increased throughput. Using multi-modal fiducial nanoparticles that remain fluorescent in epoxy resins and a 3D confocal fluorescence microscope integrated in a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB.SEM), our approach uses FM to target extremely small volumes of even single organelles for imaging in volume-EM, and obviates the need for post correlation of big 3D datasets. We extend our targeted volume-CLEM approach to include live-cell imaging, adding information on the motility of intracellular membranes selected for volume-CLEM. We demonstrate the power of our approach by targeted imaging of rare and transient contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes within hours rather than days. Our data suggest that extensive ER-lysosome and mitochondria-lysosome interactions restrict lysosome motility, highlighting the unique capabilities of our integrated CLEM pipeline for linking molecular dynamic data to high-resolution ultrastructural detail in 3D.\n\nSignificanceWe have developed a correlative imaging pipeline to (i) correlate 3D-FM to volume-EM data with high precision, directly bridging the FM and EM resolutions (ii) achieve high-throughput volume-CLEM by targeted EM imaging of a single organelle sized region-of-interest, pre-identified by FM (iii) link live-cell fluorescence imaging of cultured mammalian cells to high-throughput volume-CLEM (iv) quantitatively study structure-function relations at subcellular scale (v) link rare (e.g. membrane contact sites) and transient (e.g. organelle interactions) cellular events to 3D ultrastructure.\n\nThe targeted volume-CLEM pipeline provides a unique prospect for multi-modal correlative intracellular analysis combining dynamic interaction (live-cell imaging), functional state (live-cell imaging), molecular localization (FM), and 3D-ultrastructure (FIB.SEM) at nanometer scale.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), bearing an unusually high number of mutations, has become a dominant strain in many countries within several weeks. We report here structural, functional and antigenic properties of its full-length spike (S) protein with a native sequence in comparison with those of previously prevalent variants. Omicron S requires a substantially higher level of host receptor ACE2 for efficient membrane fusion than other variants, possibly explaining its unexpected cellular tropism. Mutations not only remodel the antigenic structure of the N-terminal domain of the S protein, but also alter the surface of the receptor-binding domain in a way not seen in other variants, consistent with its remarkable resistance to neutralizing antibodies. These results suggest that Omicron S has acquired an extraordinary ability to evade host immunity by excessive mutations, which also compromise its fusogenic capability.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The present study proposes a novel concept of neuroadaptive technology, namely a dual passive-reactive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), that enables bi-directional interaction between humans and machines. We have implemented such a system in a realistic flight simulator using the NextMind classification algorithms and framework to decode pilots intention (reactive BCI) and to infer their level of attention (passive BCI). Twelve pilots used the reactive BCI to perform checklists along with an anti-collision radar monitoring task that was supervised by the passive BCI. The latter simulated an automatic avoidance maneuver when it detected that pilots missed an incoming collision. The reactive BCI reached 100% classification accuracy with a mean reaction time of 1.6s when exclusively performing the checklist task. Accuracy was up to 98.5% with a mean reaction time of 2.5s when pilots also had to fly the aircraft and monitor the anti-collision radar. The passive BCI achieved a F1 - score of 0.94. This first demonstration shows the potential of a dual BCI to improve human-machine teaming which could be applied to a variety of applications.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Connectomics is a developing field aiming at reconstructing the connection of the neural system at nanometer scale. Computer vision technology, especially deep learning methods used in image processing, has promoted connectomic data analysis to a new era. However, the performance of the state-of-the-art methods still falls behind the demand of scientific research. Inspired by the success of ImageNet, we present the U-RISC, an annotated Ultra-high Resolution Image Segmentation dataset for Cell membrane, which is the largest cell membrane annotated Electron Microscopy (EM) dataset with a resolution of 2.18nm/pixel. Multiple iterative annotations ensured the quality of the dataset. Through an open competition, we reveal that the performance of current deep learning methods still has a considerable gap with human-level, different from ISBI 2012, on which the performance of deep learning is close to human. To explore the causes of this discrepancy, we analyze the neural networks with a visualization method, attribution analysis. We find that in U-RISC, it requires a larger area around a pixel to predict whether the pixel belongs to the cell membrane or not. Finally, we integrate currently available methods to provide a new benchmark (0.67, 10% higher than the leader of competition, 0.61) for cell membrane segmentation on U-RISC and propose some suggestions in developing deep learning algorithms. The U-RISC dataset and the deep learning codes used in this paper will be publicly available.",

Nematodes additionally employ a cell type-specific kinesin-3 motor, KLP-6, which moves within cilia independently of IFT and regulates ciliary content and function. Here we provide evidence that a KLP-6 homolog, KIF13B, undergoes bursts of bidirectional movement within primary cilia of cultured immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT-RPE1) cells. Anterograde and retrograde intraciliary velocities of KIF13B were similar to those of IFT (IFT172-eGFP), but intraciliary movement of KIF13B required its own motor domain and appeared to be cell-type specific. Our work provides the first demonstration of motor-driven, intraciliary movement by a vertebrate kinesin other than kinesin-2 motors.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundEvolutionary conservation is an invaluable tool for inferring functional significance in the genome, including regions that are crucial across many species and those that have undergone convergent evolution. Computational methods to test for sequence conservation are dominated by algorithms that examine the ability of one or more nucleotides to align across large evolutionary distances. While these nucleotide alignment-based approaches have proven powerful for protein-coding genes and some non-coding elements, they fail to capture conservation at many enhancers, distal regulatory elements that control spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression. The function of enhancers is governed by a complex, often tissue- and cell type-specific, code that links combinations of transcription factor binding sites and other regulation-related sequence patterns to regulatory activity. Thus, function of orthologous enhancer regions can be conserved across large evolutionary distances, even when nucleotide turnover is high.\n\nResultsWe present a new machine learning-based approach for evaluating enhancer conservation that leverages the combinatorial sequence code of enhancer activity rather than relying on the alignment of individual nucleotides. We first train a convolutional neural network model that is able to predict tissue-specific open chromatin, a proxy for enhancer activity, across mammals. Then, we apply that model to distinguish instances where the genome sequence would predict conserved function versus a loss regulatory activity in that tissue. We present criteria for systematically evaluating model performance for this task and use them to demonstrate that our models accurately predict tissue-specific conservation and divergence in open chromatin between primate and rodent species, vastly out-performing leading nucleotide alignment-based approaches. We then apply our models to predict open chromatin at orthologs of brain and liver open chromatin regions across hundreds of mammals and find that brain enhancers associated with neuron activity and liver enhancers associated with liver regeneration have a stronger tendency than the general population to have predicted lineage-specific open chromatin.\n\nConclusionThe framework presented here provides a mechanism to annotate tissue-specific regulatory function across hundreds of genomes and to study enhancer evolution using predicted regulatory differences rather than nucleotide-level conservation measurements.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), bacterial infections involving the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. P. aeruginosa uses a cell-cell signaling mechanism called quorum sensing (QS) to regulate many virulence functions. One type of QS consists of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals produced by LuxI-type signal synthases, which bind a cognate LuxR-type transcription factor. In laboratory strains and conditions, P. aeruginosa employs two AHL synthase/receptor pairs arranged in a hierarchy, with the LasI/R system controlling the RhlI/R system and many downstream virulence factors. However, P. aeruginosa isolates with inactivating mutations in lasR are frequently isolated from chronic CF infections. We and others have shown that these isolates frequently use RhlR as the primary QS regulator. RhlR is rarely mutated in CF and environmental settings. We were interested if there were reproducible genetic characteristics of these isolates and if there was a central group of genes regulated by RhlR in all isolates. We examined five isolates and found signatures of adaptation common to CF isolates. We did not identify a common genetic mechanism to explain the switch from Las-to Rhl-dominated QS. We describe a core RhlR regulon encompassing 20 genes encoding 7 products. These results suggest a key group of QS-regulated factors important for pathogenesis of chronic infection, and position RhlR as a target for anti-QS therapeutics. Our work underscores the need to sample a diversity of isolates to understanding QS beyond what has been described in laboratory strains.",

Whether non-linguistic creatures encode similar thoughts is an open question, as everyday behavior marked by absence (of food, of social partners) can be explained solely by expecting presence somewhere else. We investigated 8-day-old chicks looking behavior in response to events violating expectations about the presence or absence of an object. We found different behavioral responses to violations of presence and absence, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Importantly, chicks displayed an avian signature of novelty detection to violations of absence, namely a sex-dependent left-eye-bias. Follow-up experiments excluded accounts that would explain this bias by perceptual mismatch or by representing the object at different locations. These results suggest that the ability to spontaneously form thoughts about the absence of objects likely belongs to the initial cognitive repertoire of vertebrate species.",

We find that latent activation of the yeast pexophagy receptor Atg36 by the casein kinase Hrr25 in rich media is repressed by the ATPase activity of Pex1/6, the catalytic subunits of the exportomer AAA+ transmembrane complex enabling protein import into peroxisomes. Quantitative proteomics of purified Pex3, an obligate Atg36 co-receptor, support a model in which exportomer represses Atg36 without assistance from additional membrane factors. Indeed, we reconstitute inhibition of Atg36 phosphorylation in vitro using soluble Pex1/6 and define an N-terminal unstructured region of Atg36 that enables regulation by binding to Pex1. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which a compartment-specific AAA+ complex mediating organelle biogenesis and protein quality control staves off induction of selective autophagy.",

To address this, we developed an approach that combines commercially available automated phenotyping hardware with a systems biology analysis pipeline to generate a high-dimensional readout of mouse behavior/physiology, as well as intuitive and health-relevant summary statistics (resilience and biological age). We used this platform to longitudinally evaluate aging in hundreds of outbred mice across an age range from 6 months to 3.4 years. In contrast to the assumption that aging can only be measured at the limits of animal ability via challenge-based tasks, we observed widespread physiological and behavioral aging starting in early life. Using network connectivity analysis, we found that organism-level resilience exhibited an accelerating decline with age that was distinct from the trajectory of individual phenotypes. We developed a method, Combined Aging and Survival Prediction of Aging Rate (CASPAR), for jointly predicting chronological age and survival time and showed that the resulting model is able to predict both variables simultaneously, a behavior that is not captured by separate age and mortality prediction models. This study provides a uniquely high-resolution view of physiological aging in mice and demonstrates that systems-level analysis of physiology provides insights not captured by individual phenotypes. The approach described here allows aging, and other processes that affect behavior and physiology, to be studied with sophistication and rigor.",

Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we have demonstrated Wus2-induced direct somatic embryo formation and regeneration, bypassing genotype-dependent callus formation and significantly shortening the tissue culture cycle time. This method also increased regeneration capacity, resulting in higher transformation efficiency across different sorghum genotypes. Subsequently, advanced excision systems and \"altruistic\" transformation technology have been developed to generate high-quality morphogenic gene-free and/or selectable marker-free sorghum events. Finally, we demonstrated up to an additional 6.8-fold increase in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene dropout frequency using Wus2-enabled, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (compared to the control treatment with no Wus2), across various targeted loci in different sorghum genotypes. Wus2-enabled genome editing may be applicable to other crops and increasingly popular in planta transformation strategies.",

The most current and widespread of these is SARS-CoV-2. The identification of CoVs with zoonotic potential in animal reservoirs suggests that additional outbreaks are likely to occur. Evidence suggests that neutralizing antibodies are important for protection against infection with CoVs. Monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved neutralizing epitopes on diverse CoVs can form the basis for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatments and enable the design of vaccines aimed at providing pan-coronavirus protection. To this end, we previously identified a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CV3-25 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 fusion machinery, neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant comparably to the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain, cross neutralizes SARS-CoV-1 and displays cross reactive binding to recombinant proteins derived from the spike-ectodomains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we show that the neutralizing activity of CV3-25 is also maintained against the Alpha, Delta and Gamma variants of concern as well as a SARS-CoV-like bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential by binding to a conserved linear peptide in the stem-helix region on sarbecovirus spikes. A 1.74[A] crystal structure of a CV3-25/peptide complex demonstrates that CV3-25 binds to the base of the stem helix at the HR2 boundary to an epitope that is distinct from other stem-helix directed neutralizing mAbs. Thus, CV3-25 defines a novel site of sarbecovirus vulnerability that will inform pan-CoV vaccine development.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Fish perform rapid escape responses to avoid sudden predatory attacks. During escape responses, fish bend their bodies into a C-shape and quickly turn away from the predator and accelerate. The escape trajectory is determined by the initial turn (Stage 1) and a contralateral bend (Stage 2). Previous studies have used a single threat or model predator as a stimulus. In nature, however, multiple predators may attack from different directions simultaneously or in close succession. It is unknown whether fish are able to change the course of their escape response when startled by multiple stimuli at various time intervals. Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) were startled with a left and right visual stimulus in close succession. By varying the timing of the second stimulus, we were able to determine when and how a second stimulus could affect the escape response direction. Four treatments were used: a single visual stimulus (control); or two stimuli coming from opposite sides separated by a 0 ms (simultaneous treatment); a 33 ms; or a 83 ms time interval. The 33 ms and 83 ms time intervals were chosen to occur shortly before and after a predicted 60 ms visual escape latency (i.e. during Stage 1). The 0 ms and 33 ms treatments influenced both the escape trajectory and the Stage 1 turning angle, compared to a single stimulation, whereas the 83 ms treatment had no effect on the escape response. We conclude that Pacific staghorn sculpin can modulate their escape response only between stimulation and the onset of the response, but that escape responses are ballistic after the body motion has started.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTUsing double stimulation from opposite sides at different time intervals to simulate coordinated predatory attacks, Pacific staghorn sculpin escape away from the first stimulus, but were unable to turn away from the second stimulus while the escape response was in progress.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In the last years the interest on evolutionary divergence at small spatial scales has increased and so did the study of speciation caused by ecologically-based divergent natural selection. The evolutionary interplay between gene flow and local adaptation can lead to low-dispersal locally adapted specialists. When this occurs the evolutionary interplay between gene flow and local adaptation could eventually lead to speciation.\n\nThe L. saxatilis system consists of two ecotypes displaying a microhabitat-associated intraspecific dimorphism along the wave-exposed rocky shores of Galicia. In spite of being a well-known system, the dynamics of the ecotype formation remains unclear and cannot be studied from empirical evidence alone. In this study, individual-based simulations were used to incorporate relevant ecological, spatial and genetic information, to check different evolutionary scenarios that could evolve non-random mating preferences and finally may facilitate speciation.\n\nAs main results, we observed the evolution of intermediate values of choice which matches estimates from empirical data of L. saxatilis in Galician shores and coincides with previous theoretical outcomes. Also, the use of the mating correlation as a proxy for assortative mating led to spuriously inferring greater reproductive isolation in the middle habitat than in the others, which does not happen when directly considering the choice values from the simulations. We also corroborate the well-known fact that the occurrence of speciation is influenced by the strength of selection. Taken together, this means, also according to other L. saxatilis systems, that speciation is not an immediate consequence of local divergent selection and mating preferences, but a fine tuning among several factors including the ecological conditions in the shore levels, the selection strength, the mate choice stringency and cost to choosiness. The L. saxatilis system could correspond to a case of incomplete reproductive isolation, where choice intensity is intermediate and local adaptation within the habitat is strong. These results support previous interpretations of the L. saxatilis model system and indicate that further empirical studies would be interesting to test whether the mate choice mechanism functions as a similarity-like mechanism as has been shown in other littorinids.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Photosystem I (PSI) of photosynthetic organisms is a multi-subunit pigment-protein complex and functions in light harvesting and photochemical charge-separation reactions, followed by reduction of NADP to NADPH required for CO2 fixation. PSI from different photosynthetic organisms has a variety of chlorophylls (Chls), some of which are at lower-energy levels than its reaction center P700, a special pair of Chls, and are called low-energy Chls. However, the site of low-energy Chls is still under debate. Here, we solved a 2.04-[A] resolution structure of a PSI trimer by cryo-electron microscopy from a primitive cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, which has no low-energy Chls. The structure showed absence of some subunits commonly found in other cyanobacteria, confirming the primitive nature of this cyanobacterium. Comparison with the known structures of PSI from other cyanobacteria and eukaryotic organisms reveals that one dimeric and one trimeric Chls are lacking in the Gloeobacter PSI. The dimeric and trimeric Chls are named Low1 and Low2, respectively. Low2 does not exist in some cyanobacterial and eukaryotic PSIs, whereas Low1 is absent only in Gloeobacter. Since Gloeobacter is susceptible to light, this indicates that Low1 serves as a main photoprotection site in most oxyphototrophs, whereas Low2 is involved in either energy transfer or energy quenching in some of the oxyphototrophs. Thus, these findings provide insights into not only the functional significance of low-energy Chls in PSI, but also the evolutionary changes of low-energy Chls responsible for the photoprotection machinery from photosynthetic prokaryotes to eukaryotes.",

Muscle samples were assessed for respiratory compromised fibers, mtDNA copy number, and proteomics by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry.\n\nResultsMost of the [~]800 differentially represented proteins in MA versus NA pertained to mitochondria structure/function such as electron transport capacity (ETC), cristae formation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mtDNA-encoded proteins. In contrast, proteins from the spliceosome complex and nuclear pore were downregulated in MA. Consistent with proteomics data, MA had fewer respiratory compromised fibers, higher mtDNA copy number, and an increased protein ratio of the cristae-bound ETC subunits relative to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein voltage dependent anion channel. There was a substantial overlap of proteins overrepresented in MA versus NA with proteins that decline with aging and which are higher in physically active than sedentary individuals. However, we also found 176 proteins related to mitochondria that are uniquely differentially expressed in MA.\n\nDiscussionWe conclude that high function in advanced age is associated with preserving mitochondrial structure/function proteins, with under-representation of proteins involved in the spliceosome and nuclear pore complex. Whereas many of these differences in MA appear related to their physical activity habits, others may reflect unique biological (e.g., gene, environment) mechanisms that preserve muscle integrity and function with aging.",

When coupled with data describing an animals environment, ecologists can fit statistical models to location data to describe how spatial memory informs movement. We performed such an analysis on a population of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in the Canadian Arctic using a model incorporating time-dependent spatial memory patterns. Brown bear populations in the Arctic lie on the periphery of the species range, and as a result endure harsh environmental conditions. In this kind of environment, effective use of memory to inform movement strategies could spell the difference between survival and mortality. The model we fit tests four alternate hypotheses (some incorporating memory; some not) against each other, and we found a high degree of individual variation in how brown bears used memory. We found that 52% (11 of 21) of the bears used complex, time-dependent spatial memory to inform their movement decisions. These results, coupled with existing knowledge on individual variation in the population, highlight the diversity of foraging strategies for Arctic brown bears while also displaying the inference that can be drawn from this innovative movement model.",

Here, we directly test this hypothesis in the domain of color naming, by analyzing recent diachronic data from Nafaanra, a language of Ghana and Cote dIvoire, and comparing it with quantitative predictions derived from the mathematical theory of efficient data compression. We show that color naming in Nafaanra has changed over the past four decades while remaining near-optimally efficient, and that this outcome would be unlikely under a random drift process that maintains structured color categories without pressure for efficiency. To our knowledge, this finding provides the first direct evidence that color naming evolves under pressure for efficiency, supporting the hypothesis that efficiency shapes the evolution of the lexicon.",

Sessile invertebrates are essential components of trophic networks within ARs, supporting fish productivity.

While most studies focused on short term colonization by pioneer species, we propose to test the relevance of geographic location, shape, age and depth of immersion on the ARs long term colonization by species found in natural stable communities in the Gulf of Lion. We recorded the presence of five sessile invertebrates species, with contrasting life history traits and regional distribution in the natural rocky habitat, on ARs with different shapes deployed during two immersion time periods (1985 and the 2000s) and in two depth ranges (<20m and >20m). At the local level ([~]5kms), neither shape, depth nor immersion duration differentiated ARs assemblages. At the regional scale (>30kms), colonization patterns differed between species, resulting in diverse assemblages. This study highlights the primacy of geographical positioning over shape, immersion duration and depth in ARs colonization, suggesting it should be accounted for in maritime spatial planning.",

Determining the respective importance of self- and cross-fertilization in hermaphroditic flowering plants is thus important to understand their ecology and evolution. The worldwide invasive species, Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala (Lgh) presents two floral morphs: one self-compatible short-styled morph (S-morph) and one self-incompatible long-styled morph (L-morph). In this study, we identified the breeding systems of western European experimental and natural populations of Lgh by comparing structural characteristics of pollen and style, by studying self- and cross-pollen tube elongations and the viability of the resulting seeds and seedlings in both floral morphs. Our results showed no differences in pollen shape and stigma surfaces no matter the floral morph. In the self-incompatible L-morph flowers, self-pollen tubes were stopped tardily, in the ovarian area, and were unable to fertilize the ovules. This first formal identification of a late-acting, prezygotic self-incompatible system (LSI) in Ludwigia genus contributes a case of LSI in an additional family within the Myrtales order. In the self-compatible S-morph flowers, self-pollen always succeeded to self-fertilize the ovules that nearly all developed into viable seedlings. However, cross-pollen tubes always elongated faster than self-pollen tubes in both morphs. S-morph individuals may thus advantage preferential allogamy over selfing when cross-pollen is available despite its self-compatibility. As expected in late-acting self-incompatible systems, L-morph flowers authorised 0.2{per thousand} of selfed seeds during the uppermost flowering season, that increased to 1{per thousand} at the end of the flowering season. Such delayed selfing resulted in a significant quantity of viable floating seeds. They may contribute to the local regeneration, seed bank and propagation of the L-morph, which may contribute to explain its invasion success worldwide. Management plans of Lgh would gain to consider the breeding systems we identified.",

In this work we use a combination of protein expression, chemical synthesis, fluorescence anisotropy and isothermal titration calorimetry for HIF-1 sequence variants and a HIF-1- CITED hybrid sequence which we term CITIF. We show the HIF-1 sequence is highly tolerant to sequence variation through reduced enthalpic and less unfavourable entropic contributions, These data imply backbone as opposed to side chain interactions and ligand folding control the binding interaction and that sequence variations are tolerated as a result of adopting a more disordered bound interaction or \"fuzzy\" complex.",

Set8/KMT5A also has non-histone substrates, making it difficult to determine which developmental functions of Set8/KMT5A are attributable to H4K20me1 and which to other substrates or to non-catalytic roles. Here, we show that human KMT5A can functionally substitute for Set8 during Drosophila development and that the catalytic SET domains of the two enzymes are fully interchangeable. We also uncovered a role in eye development for the N-terminal domain of Set8 that cannot be complemented by human KMT5A. Whereas Set8null mutants are inviable, we found that an R634G mutation in the SET domain predicted to ablate catalytic activity resulted in viable adults, suggesting important non-catalytic functions of Set8. Similarly, flies that were engineered to express only unmodifiable H4 histones (H4K20A) can also complete development, but they are phenotypically distinct from H4K20R, Set8null, and Set8R634G animals.

Our results show that as much as 15% of all PAMP response genes display alternative transcription initiation. In several cases, use of alternative TSSs may be regulatory as it determines inclusion of target peptides or protein domains, or occurrence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in mRNA leader sequences. We also find that 60% of PAMP-response genes respond much earlier than previously thought. In particular, a previously unnoticed cluster of rapidly and transiently PAMP-induced genes is enriched in transcription factors whose functions, previously associated with biological processes as diverse as abiotic stress adaptation and stem cell activity, appear to converge on growth restriction. Furthermore, some examples of known potentiators of PTI, in one case under direct MAP kinase control, support the notion that the rapidly induced transcription factors could constitute direct links to PTI signaling pathways and drive gene expression changes underlying establishment of the immune state.",

S. mutans B04Sm5 was recently shown to produce reutericyclins and mutanocyclin through the muc biosynthetic gene cluster, and to utilize reutericyclins to inhibit the growth of neighboring commensal Streptococci. In this study, examination of S. mutans and muc phylogeny suggested evolution of an ancestral S. mutans muc into three lineages within one S. mutans clade, and then horizontal transfer of muc to other S. mutans clades. The roles of the mucG and mucH transcriptional regulators, and the mucI transporter, were also examined. mucH was demonstrated to encode a transcriptional activator of muc. mucH deletion reduced production of mutanocyclin and reutericyclins, and eliminated the impaired growth and inhibition of neighboring Streptococci phenotypes which are associated with reutericyclin production. {Delta}mucG had increased mutanocyclin and reutericyclin production, which impaired growth and increased the ability to inhibit neighboring Streptococci. However, deletion of mucG also caused reduced expression of mucD, mucE, and mucI. Deletion of mucI reduced mutanocyclin and reutericylin production, but enhanced growth, suggesting that mucI may not transport reutericyclin as its homolog does in Limosilactobacillus reuteri. Further research is needed to determine the roles of mucG and mucI, and to identify any co-factors affecting the activity of the mucG and mucH regulators. Overall, this study provided pangenome and phylogenetic analysis that serves as a resource for S. mutans research, and began elucidation of the regulation of reutericyclins and mutanocyclin production in S. mutans.\n\nImportanceS. mutans must be able to outcompete neighboring organisms in its ecological niche in order to cause dental caries. S. mutans B04Sm5 inhibited the growth of neighboring commensal Streptococci through production of reutericyclins via the muc biosynthetic gene cluster. In this study, carriage of muc was examined across S. mutans, which showed that 35 of 244 RefSeq S. mutans genomes encoded muc and provided a valuable update to the S. mutans pangenome and phylogeny. The roles of the mucG and mucH transcriptional regulators, and the mucI transporter, were also examined. All 3 genes impacted production of mutanocyclin and reutericyclins, which affected the growth rates, transcriptomes, and the ability of the S. mutans strains to inhibit the growth of neighboring commensals.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In bacteria, copper (Cu) can support metabolic processes as an enzymatic cofactor but can also cause cell damage if present in excess, leading to intoxication. In group B Streptococcus (GBS) a system for control of Cu efflux based on the canonical cop operon supports survival during Cu stress. In some other bacteria, genetic systems additional to the cop operon are engaged during Cu stress and also contribute to Cu management. Here, we examined genetic systems beyond the cop operon in GBS for regions that contribute to survival of GBS in Cu stress using a forward genetic screen and probe of the entire bacterial genome. A high-density mutant library, generated using pGh9-ISS1, was used to expose GBS to Cu stress and compared to non-exposed controls en masse. Nine genes were identified as essential for GBS survival in Cu stress, whereas five genes constrained GBS growth in Cu stress. The genes encode varied factors including enzymes for metabolism, cell wall synthesis, transporters and global transcriptional regulators. Targeted mutation of the genes validated their roles in GBS resistance to Cu stress. Notably, several genes, including stp1, yceG, plyB and rfaB were also essential for resistance to Zn stress. Excepting copA, the genes identified are new to the area of bacterial metal ion intoxication. We conclude that a discrete and limited suite of genes beyond the cop operon in GBS contribute to a repertoire of mechanisms used to survive Cu stress in vitro and achieve cellular homeostasis.\n\nSignificance StatementGenetic systems for copper (Cu) homeostasis in bacteria, including Streptococci, are vital to survive metal ion stress. Genetic systems that underpin survival of GBS during Cu stress, beyond for the archetypal cop operon for Cu management, are undefined. We show that Streptococcus resists Cu intoxication by utilizing a discrete and limited suite of genes beyond the cop operon, including several genes that are new to the area of bacterial cell metal ion homeostasis. The Cu resistome of GBS defined here enhances our understanding of metal ion homeostasis in GBS.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Inter-organellar crosstalk is often mediated by membrane contact sites (MCSs), which are zones where participating membranes come within a proximity of 30 nm. MCSs have been found in organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, endosomes, and mitochondria. Despite its seeming ubiquity, reports of MCS involving mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs) present in a few anaerobic parasitic protozoa remain lacking. Entamoeba histolytica, the etiological agent of amoebiasis, possesses an MRO called mitosome. We previously discovered several Entamoeba-specific transmembrane mitosomal proteins (ETMPs) from in silico and cell biological analyses. One of them, ETMP1 (EHI_175060), was predicted to have one transmembrane domain and two coiled-coil regions, and was demonstrated to be mitosome membrane-integrated based on carbonate fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) data. Immunoprecipitation analysis detected a candidate interacting partner, EH-domain containing protein (EHD1, EHI_105270). We expressed HA-tagged EHD1 in E. histolytica and subsequent immunofluorescence and IEM data indicated an unprecedented MCS between the mitosome and the endosome. Live imaging of GFP-EHD1 expressing strain demonstrated that EHD1 is involved in early endosome formation, and is observed in MCS between endosomes of various sizes. In vitro assay using recombinant His-EHD1 demonstrated ATPase activity. MCSs are involved in lipid transfer, ion homeostasis, and organelle dynamics. The serendipitous discovery of the ETMP1 interacting partner EHD1, led to the observation of the mitosome-endosome contact site in E. histolytica. It opened a new view of how the relic mitochondria of Entamoeba may likewise be involved in organelle crosstalk, a conserved feature of mitochondria and other organelles in general.",

Despite several years of reduced antibiotics usage in livestock production in the UK and US, high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) persists in Campylobacter. Both countries have instigated genome sequencing-based surveillance programs for Campylobacter, and here we have identified AMR genes in 32,256 C. jejuni and 8,776 C. coli publicly available genome sequences to compare the prevalence and trends of AMR in Campylobacter isolated in the UK and US between 2001-2018. AMR markers were detected in 68% of C. coli and 53% of C. jejuni, with 15% of C. coli being multi-drug resistant (MDR) compared to only 2% of C. jejuni. The prevalence of aminoglycoside, macrolide, quinolone and tetracycline resistance remained fairly stable from 2001-2018 in both C. jejuni and C. coli, but statistically significant differences were observed between the UK and US. There was a statistically significant higher prevalence of aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance for US C. coli and C. jejuni, and macrolide resistance for US C. coli. In contrast, UK C. coli and C. jejuni showed a significantly higher prevalence of quinolone resistance. Specific MLST clonal complexes (e.g. ST-353/464) showed >95% quinolone resistance. This large-scale comparison of AMR prevalence has shown that the prevalence of AMR remains stable for Campylobacter in the UK and the US. This suggests that antimicrobial stewardship and restricted antibiotic usage may help contain further expansion of AMR prevalence in Campylobacter, but are unlikely to reduce it in the short term.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Malassezia species are important fungal skin commensals and are part of the normal microbiota of humans and other animals. However, under certain circumstances these fungi can also display a pathogenic behaviour. For example, Malassezia furfur is a common commensal of human skin, and yet is often responsible for skin disorders but also systemic infections. Comparative genomics analysis of M. furfur revealed that some isolates have a hybrid origin, similar to several other recently described hybrid fungal pathogens. Because hybrid species exhibit genomic plasticity that can impact phenotypes, we sought to elucidate the genomic evolution and phenotypic characteristics of M. furfur hybrids in comparison to their parental lineages. To this end, we performed a comparative genomics analysis between hybrid strains and their presumptive parental lineages, and assessed phenotypic characteristics. Our results provide evidence that at least two distinct hybridization events occurred between the same parental lineages, and that the parental strains may have originally been hybrids themselves. Analysis of the mating-type locus reveals that M. furfur has a pseudobipolar mating system, and provides evidence that after sexual liaisons of mating compatible cells, hybridization involved cell-cell fusion leading to a diploid/aneuploid state. This study provides new insights into the evolutionary trajectory of M. furfur and contributes with valuable genomic resources for future pathogenicity studies.\n\nImportanceMalassezia furfur is a common commensal member of human/animal microbiota that is also associated with several pathogenic states. Recent studies report involvement of Malassezia species in Crohns disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic cancer progression, and exacerbation of Cystic fibrosis. A recent genomics analysis of M. furfur revealed the existence of hybrid isolates and identified their putative parental lineages. In this study, we explored the genomic and phenotypic features of these hybrids in comparison to their putative parental lineages. Our results revealed the existence of a pseudobipolar mating system in this species and showed evidence for the occurrence of multiple hybridization events in the evolutionary trajectory of M. furfur. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the evolution of this commensal microbe and are relevant for future studies exploring the role of hybridization in the adaptation to new niches or environments, including the emergence of pathogenicity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Membrane transport proteins perform crucial roles in cell physiology. The obligate intracellular parasite Plasmodium falciparum, an agent of human malaria, relies on membrane transport proteins for the uptake of nutrients from the host, disposal of metabolic waste, exchange of metabolites between organelles and generation and maintenance of transmembrane electrochemical gradients for its growth and replication within human erythrocytes. Despite their importance for Plasmodium cellular physiology, the functional roles of a number of membrane transport proteins remain unclear, which is particularly true for orphan membrane transporters that have no or limited sequence homology to transporter proteins in other evolutionary lineages. Therefore, in the current study, we applied endogenous tagging, targeted gene disruption, conditional knockdown and knockout approaches to investigate the subcellular localization and essentiality of six membrane transporters during intraerythrocytic development of P. falciparum parasites. They are localized at different subcellular structures - the food vacuole, the apicoplast, and the parasite plasma membrane - and four out of the six membrane transporters are essential during asexual development. Additionally, the plasma membrane resident transporter 1 (PMRT1, PF3D7_1135300), a unique Plasmodium-specific plasma membrane transporter, was shown to be essential for gametocytogenesis and functionally conserved within the genus Plasmodium. Overall, we reveal the importance of four orphan transporters to blood stage P. falciparum development, which have diverse intracellular localizations and putative functions.\n\nImportancePlasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes possess multiple compartments with designated membranes. Transporter proteins embedded in these membranes do not only facilitate movement of nutrients, metabolites and other molecules between these compartments, but are common therapeutic targets and can also confer antimalarial drug resistance. Orphan membrane transporter in P. falciparum without sequence homology to transporters in other evolutionary lineages and divergent to host transporters may constitute attractive targets for novel intervention approaches. Here, we localized six of these putative transporters at different subcellular compartments and probed into their importance during asexual parasite growth using reverse genetic approaches. In total, only two candidates turned out to be dispensable for the parasite, highlighting four candidates as putative targets for therapeutic interventions. This study reveals the importance of several orphan transporters to blood stage P. falciparum development.",

They can be difficult to culture and may be morphologically indistinct in culture. They can have complex genomes of over 1 Gb in size and are still underrepresented in whole genome sequence databases. Overall their description and analysis lags far behind other microbes such as bacteria. At the same time, classification of species via high throughput sequencing without prior purification is increasingly becoming the norm for pathogen detection, microbiome studies, and environmental monitoring. However, standardized procedures for characterizing unknown fungi from complex sequencing data have not yet been established.\n\nResultsWe compared different metagenomics sequencing and analysis strategies for the identification of fungal species. Using two fungal mock communities of 44 phylogenetically diverse species, we compared species classification and community composition analysis pipelines using shotgun metagenomics and amplicon sequencing data generated from both short and long read sequencing technologies. We show that regardless of the sequencing methodology used, the highest accuracy of species identification was achieved by sequence alignment against a fungi-specific database. During the assessment of classification algorithms, we found that applying cut-offs to the query coverage of each read or contig significantly improved the classification accuracy and community composition analysis without significant data loss.\n\nConclusionOverall, our study expands the toolkit for identifying fungi by improving sequence-based fungal classification, and provides a practical guide for the design of metagenomics analyses.",

Here, we present a multi-omics analysis to identify compositional and functional gut microbiome patterns associated with HIV-1 control in the BCN02 trial.\n\nResultsViremic controllers during the MAP (controllers) exhibited higher Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio and lower microbial gene richness before vaccination and throughout the study intervention when compared to non-controllers. Longitudinal assessment indicated that the gut microbiome of controllers was enriched in pro-inflammatory bacteria and depleted in butyrate-producing bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Functional profiling also showed that metabolic pathways, including methanogenesis and carbohydrate biosynthesis, were significantly decreased in controllers. Fecal metaproteome analyses confirmed that baseline functional differences were mainly driven by Clostridiales. Participants with high baseline Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio had increased pre-existing immune activation-related transcripts. The Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio as well as host immune-activation signatures inversely correlated with HIV-1 reservoir size.\n\nConclusionsThis proof-of-concept study suggests the Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio as a novel gut microbiome signature associated with HIV-1 reservoir size and immune-mediated viral control after ART interruption.",

Recent advances in live imaging have started to unravel the cellular choreography underlying this process in mammals, however, the sequence of events transforming an unpatterned cell ensemble into structured territories is largely unknown. Here, using gastruloids -3D aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells-we study the formation of one of the three germ layers, the endoderm. We show that the endoderm is generated from an epiblast-like homogeneous state by a three-step mechanism: (i) a loss of E-cadherin mediated contacts in parts of the aggregate leading to the appearance of islands of E-cadherin expressing cells surrounded by cells devoid of E-cadherin, (ii) a separation of these two populations with islands of E-cadherin expressing cells flowing toward the aggregate tip, and (iii) their differentiation into an endoderm population. During the flow, the islands of E-cadherin expressing cells are surrounded by cells expressing T-Brachyury, reminiscent of the process occurring at the primitive streak. Consistent with recent in vivo observations, the endoderm formation in the gastruloids does not require an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, but rather a maintenance of an epithelial state for a subset of cells coupled with fragmentation of E-cadherin contacts in the vicinity, and a sorting process. Our data emphasize the role of signaling and tissue flows in the establishment of the body plan.",

Importantly, ligating the B-cell integrin, LFA-1, with ICAM-1 promotes IS formation when antigen is limiting. Whether the actin cytoskeleton plays a specific role in integrin-dependent IS formation is unknown. Here we show using super-resolution imaging of mouse primary B cells that LFA-1: ICAM-1 interactions promote the formation of an actomyosin network that dominates the B-cell IS. This network is created by the formin mDia1, organized into concentric, contractile arcs by myosin 2A, and flows inward at the same rate as B-cell receptor (BCR): antigen clusters. Consistently, individual BCR microclusters are swept inward by individual actomyosin arcs. Under conditions where integrin is required for synapse formation, inhibiting myosin impairs synapse formation, as evidenced by reduced antigen centralization, diminished BCR signaling, and defective signaling protein distribution at the synapse. Together, these results argue that a contractile actomyosin arc network plays a key role in the mechanism by which LFA-1 co-stimulation promotes B-cell activation and IS formation.",

CT was described previously as the tendency of explants of the ventral IMZ of Xenopus to converge their circumblastoporal dimension and thicken their radial dimension (Keller and Danilchik 1988). Here we show that CT occurs from the onset of gastrulation, initially throughout the pre-involution IMZ. We suggest that CT is driven by an increase in the interfacial tension between the deep IMZ and its epithelium, resulting in cells of the deep IMZ tending to minimize their surface area. In explants, this results in a progressive shortening (convergence) of the IMZ along its longer mediolateral axis and thickening in the orthogonal planes, and can generate tensile force (Shook et al. 2018). In vivo, convergence of the annular IMZ generates circumferential tension, closing the blastopore. These results provide the first clear example of a tensile morphogenic force from a Holtfreterian/Steinbergian change in tissue affinity.",

Here we integrate high-plex imaging, 3D high-resolution microscopy, and spatially-resolved micro-region transcriptomics to study immune evasion and immunoediting in primary melanoma. We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods involving tumor, immune, and stromal cells change significantly along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma in situ, and invasive tumor. Hallmarks of immunosuppression are already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted suppressive environment forms along the tumor-stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of MHC-II and IDO1, and by PD1-PDL1 mediated cell contacts involving macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. A few millimeters away, cytotoxic T cells synapse with melanoma cells in fields of tumor regression. Thus, invasion and immunoediting can co-exist within a few millimeters of each other in a single specimen.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe reorganization of the tumor ecosystem in primary melanoma is an excellent setting in which to study immunoediting and immune evasion.

Low hybrid fitness can cause population declines, making extinction of one or both species likely. High intrinsic growth rates result in higher reproductive rates when populations are below carrying capacity, reducing the probability of extinction and increasing the probability of stable coexistence at moderate levels of assortative mating and hybrid fitness. Very strong but incomplete assortative mating can induce low hybrid fitness via a mating disadvantage to rare genotypes, and this can stabilize coexistence of two species at high but incomplete levels of assortative mating. Given these results and evidence that it may take many millions of years of divergence before related species become sympatric, we postulate that coexistence of closely-related species is more often limited by insufficient assortative mating than by insufficient ecological differentiation.",

Although this aspect of the lifecycle places Trichuris in a microbiota-rich environment, metabolic byproducts of bacteria that facilitate the reproductive development of parasites are unknown. Here, we employ a pipeline using the well-characterized free-living nematode C. elegans to identify microbial factors with conserved roles in the reproduction of nematodes. A screen for E. coli mutants that impair C. elegans fertility identified genes in fatty acid biosynthesis and ethanolamine utilization pathways, including fabH and eutN. Trichuris muris eggs displayed defective hatching in the presence of E. coli deficient in fabH or eutN due to reduction in arginine or elevated levels of aldehydes, respectively. Remarkably, T. muris reared in gnotobiotic mice colonized with these E. coli mutants displayed profound abnormalities including morphological defects and a failure to lay viable eggs. These findings indicate that microbial byproducts mediate evolutionarily conserved transkingdom interactions that impact the reproductive fitness of distantly-related nematodes.",

It remains a challenge to understand how these cell states, which are mostly non-existent in healthy tissue, become stable phenotypes participating in collective cancer migration. The transcription factor Nrf2, which is associated with tumor progression and resistance to therapy, appears to be central to this process. Here, using a combination of single cell biosensors, immunocytochemistry, and computational modeling, we show that Nrf2 functions as a phenotypic stability factor for hybrid E/M cells by inhibiting a complete epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during collective cancer migration. We also demonstrate that Nrf2 and EMT signaling are spatially coordinated near the migrating front. In particular, computational analysis of an Nrf2-EMT-Notch network and experimental modulation of Nrf2 by pharmacological treatment or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing reveal that Nrf2 stabilizes a hybrid E/M phenotype which is maximally observed in the interior region immediately behind the leading edge. We further demonstrate that the Nrf2-EMT-Notch network enhances Dll4 and Jagged1 expression near the leading edge, which correlates with the formation of leader cells and protruding tips. Altogether, our results provide direct evidence that Nrf2 acts as a phenotypic stability factor in restricting complete EMT and plays an important role in coordinating collective cancer migration.",

Here we utilize long read single-molecule sequencing to track mtDNA mutational trajectories in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show a previously unseen pattern that constrains subsequent excision events in mtDNA fragmentation. We also provide evidence for the generation of rare and contentious non-periodic mtDNA structures that lead to persistent diversity within individual cells. Finally, we show that measurements of relative fitness of mtDNA fit a phenomenological model that highlights important biophysical parameters governing mtDNA fitness.

Many studies using ATAC-seq use mammalian or human-derived tissues, and established protocols work well in these systems. However, ATAC-seq is not yet widely used in Drosophila. Vinegar flies present several advantages over mammalian systems that make them an excellent model for ATAC-seq studies, including abundant genetic tools that allow straightforward targeting, transgene expression, and genetic manipulation, and are not available in mammalian models. Because current ATAC-seq protocols are not optimized to use flies, we developed an optimized workflow that accounts for several complicating factors present in Drosophila. We examined parameters affecting nuclei isolation, including input size, freezing time, washing, and possible confounds from retinal pigments. Then, we optimized the enzymatic steps of library construction to account for the smaller Drosophila genome size. Finally, we used our optimized protocol to generate ATAC-seq libraries that meet ENCODE quality metrics. Our optimized protocol enables extensive ATAC-seq experiments in Drosophila, thereby leveraging the advantages of this powerful model system to understand chromatin-mediated gene regulation.",

Here, we show that many of these patterns can be quantitatively recapitulated by a simple class of resource-competition models, in which the metabolic capabilities of different species are randomly drawn from a common statistical ensemble. Our coarse-grained model parametrizes the intrinsic consumer-resource properties of a community using a small number of macroscopic parameters, including the total number of resources, typical resource fluctuations over time, and the average overlap in resource-consumption profiles across species. We elucidate how variation in these parameters affects various time series statistics, enabling macroscopic parameter estimation and comparison across wide-ranging microbiotas, including the human gut, saliva, and vagina, as well as mouse gut and rice. The successful recapitulation of time series statistics across microbiotas suggests that resource competition generally acts as a dominant driver of community dynamics. Our work unifies numerous time series patterns under one model, clarifies their origins, and provides a framework to infer macroscopic parameters of resource competition from longitudinal studies of microbial communities.",

Encouraging progress has been made in developing small molecule inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and main protease (Mpro). However, the development of papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitors faces several obstacles. Nevertheless, PLpro represents a high-profile drug target given its multifaceted roles in viral replication. PLpro is involved in not only the cleavage of viral polyprotein but also modulation of host immune response. In this study, we conducted a drug-repurposing screening of PLpro against the MedChemExpress bioactive compound library and identified three hits, EACC, KY-226, and tropifexor, as potent PLpro inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 3.39 to 8.28 {micro}M. The three hits showed dose-dependent binding to PLpro in the thermal shift assay. In addition, tropifexor inhibited the cellular PLpro activity in the FlipGFP assay with an IC50 of 10.6 {micro}M. Gratifyingly, tropifexor showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells with an EC50 of 4.03 {micro}M, a 7.8-fold increase compared to GRL0617 (EC50 = 31.4 {micro}M). Overall, tropifexor represents a novel PLpro inhibitor that can be further developed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.",

How mechanical stimuli influence intracellular trafficking and how such regulation impacts tissue mechanics are not fully understood. In this study, we identify an actomyosin dependent mechanism involving Rab11- mediated trafficking in regulating apical constriction in the Drosophila embryo. During Drosophila mesoderm invagination, apical actin and Myosin II (actomyosin) contractility induces apical accumulation of Rab11-marked vesicle-like structures (\"Rab11 vesicles\") by promoting a directional bias in dynein mediated vesicle transport. At the apical domain, Rab11 vesicles are enriched near the adherens junctions (AJs). The apical accumulation of Rab11 vesicles is essential to prevent fragmented apical AJs, breaks in the supracellular actomyosin network and a reduction in the apical constriction rate. This Rab11 function is separate from its role in promoting apical Myosin II accumulation. These findings suggest a feedback mechanism between actomyosin activity and Rab11-mediated intracellular trafficking that regulates the force generation machinery during tissue folding.",

Recent reports have identified E. coli strains with phenotypic resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam but susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins (TZP-R/3GC-S). In this study we sought to determine the genetic diversity of this phenotype in E. coli (n = 58) isolated between 2014-2017 at a single tertiary hospital in Liverpool, UK, as well as the associated resistance mechanisms. We compare our findings to a UK-wide collection of invasive E. coli isolates (n = 1509) with publicly available phenotypic and genotypic data. These data sets included the TZP-R/3GC-S phenotype (n = 68), a piperacillin/tazobactam and third generation cephalosporin-susceptible (TZP-S/3GC-S, n = 1271) phenotypes. The TZP-R/3GC-S phenotype was displayed in a broad range of sequence types which was mirrored in the same phenotype from the UK-wide collection, and the overall diversity of invasive E. coli isolates. The TZP-R/3GC-S isolates contained a diverse range of plasmids, indicating multiple acquisition events of TZP resistance mechanisms rather than clonal expansion of a particular plasmid or sequence type. The putative resistance mechanisms were equally diverse, including hyperproduction of TEM-1, either via strong promoters or gene amplification, carriage of inhibitor resistant {beta}-lactamases, and an S133G b/aCTX-M-15 mutation detected for the first time in clinical isolates. Several of these mechanisms were present at a lower abundance in the TZP-S/3GC-S isolates from the UK-wide collection, but without the associated phenotypic resistance to TZP. Our findings highlight the complexity of this cryptic phenotype and the need for continued phenotypic monitoring, as well as further investigation to improve detection and prediction of the TZP-R/3GC-S phenotype from genomic data.",

Though these techniques guide axons between groups of neurons, multiscale control of neuronal connectivity, from circuits to synapses, is yet to be achieved in vitro. As studying neuronal circuits with synaptic resolution in vivo poses significant challenges, an in vitro alternative could serve as a testbed for in vivo experiments or as a platform for validating biophysical and computational models. In this work we use a combination of electron beam and photolithography to create polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures with features ranging from 150 nanometers to a few millimeters. Leveraging the difference between average axon and dendritic spine diameters, we restrict axon growth while allowing spines to pass through nanochannels to guide synapse formation between small groups of neurons (i.e. nodes). We show this technique can be used to generate large numbers of isolated feed-forward circuits where connections between nodes are restricted to regions connected by nanochannels. Using a genetically encoded calcium indicator in combination with fluorescently tagged post synaptic protein, PSD-95, we demonstrate functional synapses can form in this region. Although more work needs to be done to control connectivity in vitro, we believe this is a significant step in that direction.",

However, this drug identification strategy requires laborious library screening, which is time-consuming and often limited number of compounds can be screened. As an alternative approach, we developed and trained a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based classification model using information extracted from experimentally identified HSPG and actin inhibitors. This method allowed us to virtually screen 170,000 compounds, resulting in [~]2000 potential hits. A hit confirmation assay with the uptake of a fluorescently labeled HSPG cargo further shortlisted 256 active compounds.

In this study, aggregation chimeras were generated from homozygous unaffected normal and CLN6 affected sheep embryos, resulting in seven chimeric animals with varied proportions of normal to affected cells. These sheep were classified as affected-like, recovering-like or normal-like, based on their cell-genotype ratios and their clinical and neuropathological profiles.\n\nNeuropathological examination of the affected-like animals revealed intense glial activation, prominent storage body accumulation and severe neurodegeneration within all cortical brain regions, along with vision loss and decreasing intracranial volumes and cortical thicknesses consistent with ovine CLN6 disease. In contrast, intercellular communication affecting pathology was evident at both the gross and histological level in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras, resulting in a lack of glial activation and rare storage body accumulation in only a few cells. Initial intracranial volumes of the recovering-like chimeras were below normal but progressively recovered to about normal by two years of age. All had normal cortical thicknesses, and none went blind. Extended neurogenesis was evident in the brains of all the chimeras.\n\nThis study indicates that although CLN6 is a membrane bound protein, the consequent defect is not cell intrinsic.

However, the complex interaction of meteorological factors driving the temporal trends of leptospirosis remain incompletely understood.\\n\\nMethods and findingsFrom 1996 to 2010, we investigated the association between the weekly incidence of leptospirosis and climatic variables in the city of Salvador, Brazil by using a dynamic generalized linear model that accounted for time lags, overall trend and seasonal variation. Our model showed an increase of leptospirosis cases associated with rainfall, lower temperature and higher humidity. There was a lag of one-to-two weeks between weekly values for significant meteorological variables and leptospirosis incidence. Independent of the season, a weekly cumulative rainfall of 20 mm increased the risk of the leptospirosis by 10% compared to a week without rain. Finally, over the 14 year study period the incidence of leptospirosis decreased significantly by four fold (12.8 versus 3.6 per 100,000 people), independently of variations in climate.\\n\\nConclusionsStrategies to control leptospirosis should focus on avoiding contact with contaminated sources of Leptospira as well as on increasing awareness in the population and health professionals within the short time window after both low-level and extreme rainfall events. Increased leptospirosis incidence was restricted to one-to-two weeks after those events suggesting that infectious Leptospira survival may be limited to short time intervals.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo determine the role of meteorological variables, seasonal variation and temporal trends in the incidence of leptospirosis, we investigated the time series of leptospirosis incidence amongst residents of Salvador, Brazil, from 1996 to 2010. Exploratory and confirmatory statistical methods detected associations between meteorological factors and disease incidence. Results showed the importance of extreme meteorological conditions, particularly rainfall, as short-term predictors of leptospirosis incidence.

    "preprint_abstract": "Comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced gene expression signatures to drug treatment-induced gene expression signatures is a promising bioinformatic tool to repurpose existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The general hypothesis of signature based drug repurposing is that drugs with inverse similarity to a disease signature can reverse disease phenotype and thus be effective against it. However, in the case of viral infection diseases, like SARS-CoV-2, infected cells also activate adaptive, antiviral pathways, so that the relationship between effective drug and disease signature can be more ambiguous.\n\nTo address this question, we analysed gene expression data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines, and gene expression signatures of drugs showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our extensive functional genomic analysis showed that both infection and treatment with in vitro effective drugs leads to activation of antiviral pathways like NFkB and JAK-STAT. Based on the similarity - and not inverse similarity - between drug and infection-induced gene expression signatures, we were able to predict the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs. We also identified SREBF1/2, key regulators of lipid metabolising enzymes, as the most activated transcription factors by several in vitro effective antiviral drugs. Using a fluorescently labeled cholesterol sensor, we showed that these drugs decrease the cholesterol levels of plasma-membrane. Supplementing drug-treated cells with cholesterol reversed the in vitro antiviral effect, suggesting the depleting plasma-membrane cholesterol plays a key role in virus inhibitory mechanism.\n\nOur results can help to more effectively repurpose approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and also highlights key mechanisms behind their antiviral effect.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=171 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459786v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7cd823org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@51f699org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114c555org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a774ee_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) is a powerful high-throughput technology that allows analysis of up to 50 protein markers per cell for the quantification and classification of single cells. Traditional manual gating utilized to identify new cell populations has been inadequate, inefficient, unreliable, and difficult to use, and no algorithms to identify both calibration and new cell populations has been well established.\n\nMethodsA deep learning with graphic cluster (DGCyTOF) visualization is developed as a new integrated embedding visualization approach in identifying canonical and new cell types. The DGCyTOF combines deep-learning classification and hierarchical stable-clustering methods to sequentially build a tri-layer construct for known cell types and the identification of new cell types. First, deep classification learning is constructed to distinguish calibration cell populations from all cells by softmax classification assignment under a probability threshold, and graph embedding clustering is then used to identify new cell populations sequentially. In the middle of two-layer, cell labels are automatically adjusted between new and unknown cell populations via a feedback loop using an iteration calibration system to reduce the rate of error in the identification of cell types, and a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization platform is finally developed to display the cell clusters with all cell-population types annotated.\n\nResultsUtilizing two benchmark CyTOF databases comprising up to 43 million cells, we compared accuracy and speed in the identification of cell types among DGCyTOF, DeepCyTOF, and other technologies including dimension reduction with clustering, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture clustering. We observed the DGCyTOF represents a robust complete learning system with high accuracy, speed and visualization by eight measurement criteria. The DGCyTOF displayed F-scores of 0.9921 for CyTOF1 and 0.9992 for CyTOF2 datasets, whereas those scores were only 0.507 and 0.529 for the t-SNE+k-means; 0.565 and 0.59, for UMAP+ k-means. Comparison of DGCyTOF with t-SNE and UMAP visualization in accuracy demonstrated its approximately 35% superiority in predicting cell types. In addition, observation of cell-population distribution was more intuitive in the 3D visualization in DGCyTOF than t-SNE and UMAP visualization.\n\nConclusionsThe DGCyTOF model can automatically assign known labels to single cells with high accuracy using deep-learning classification assembling with traditional graph-clustering and dimension-reduction strategies. Guided by a calibration system, the model seeks optimal accuracy balance among calibration cell populations and unknown cell types, yielding a complete and robust learning system that is highly accurate in the identification of cell populations compared to results using other methods in the analysis of single-cell CyTOF data. Application of the DGCyTOF method to identify cell populations could be extended to the analysis of single-cell RNASeq data and other omics data.\n\nAvailability and implementationA Python package (Python 3) and analysis scripts for reproducing the results are available at https://lijcheng12.github.io/DGCyTOF/.\n\nDGCyTOF python package contactLijun.cheng@osu.edu.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at journal **** online.\n\nKey pointsO_LIDGCyTOF has been developed for the automatic identification of known and new cell populations.\nC_LIO_LIOptimal dimension reduction that integrates graphic-clustering technology facilitates highly accurate identification of new cell populations.\nC_LIO_LIUse of a feedback-calibration system can enhance the homology of cell types for the identification of cell populations.\nC_LIO_LIThree-dimensional visualization technology allows vivid depiction of cell types to improve their classification.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Scientific research is shedding light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human host and on its role in human health state. Existing machine learning methods have shown great potential in discriminating healthy from diseased microbiome states. Most of them leverage shotgun metagenomic sequencing to extract gut microbial species-relative abundances or strain-level markers. Each of these gut microbial features showed diagnostic potential when tested separately; however, no existing approach combines them in a single predictive framework. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel deep learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. MVIB achieves competitive classification performance while being faster than existing methods. Additionally, MVIB offers interpretable results. Our model adopts an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks and computes a joint stochastic encoding of different input data modalities. We use MVIB to predict whether human hosts are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing gut microbial species-relative abundances and strain-level markers. MVIB is evaluated on human gut metagenomic samples from 11 publicly available disease cohorts covering 6 different diseases. We achieve high performance (0.80 < ROC AUC < 0.95) on 5 cohorts and at least medium performance on the remaining ones. We adopt a saliency technique to interpret the output of MVIB and identify the most relevant microbial species and strain-level markers to the models predictions. We also perform cross-study generalisation experiments, where we train and test MVIB on different cohorts of the same disease, and overall we achieve comparable results to the baseline approach. Further, we evaluate our model by adding metabolomic data derived from mass spectrometry as a third input modality. Our method is scalable with respect to input data modalities and has an average training time of < 1.4 seconds. The source code and the datasets used in this work are publicly available.\n\nAuthor summaryThe gut microbiome can be an indicator of various diseases due to its interaction with the human system. Our main objective is to improve on the current state of the art in microbiome classification for diagnostic purposes. A rich body of literature evidences the clinical value of microbiome predictive models. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel deep learning model for microbiome-based disease prediction. MVIB learns a joint stochastic encoding of different input data modalities to predict the output class. We use MVIB to predict whether human hosts are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing gut microbial species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles. Both of these gut microbial features showed diagnostic potential when tested separately in previous studies; however, no research has combined them in a single predictive tool. We evaluate MVIB on various human gut metagenomic samples from 11 publicly available disease cohorts. MVIB achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we evaluate our model by adding metabolomic data as a third input modality and we show that MVIB is scalable with respect to input feature modalities.

    "preprint_abstract": "As part of the human microbiota, the fungus Candida albicans colonizes the oral cavity and other mucosal surfaces of the human body. Commensalism is tightly controlled by complex interactions of the fungus and the host to preclude fungal elimination but also fungal overgrowth and invasion, which can result in disease. As such, defects in antifungal T cell immunity render individuals susceptible to oral thrush due to interrupted immunosurveillance of the oral mucosa. The factors that promote commensalism and ensure persistence of C. albicans in a fully immunocompetent host remain less clear. Using an experimental model of C. albicans oral colonization in mice we explored fungal determinants of commensalism in the oral cavity. Transcript profiling of the oral isolate 101 in the murine tongue tissue revealed a characteristic metabolic profile tailored to the nutrient poor conditions in the stratum corneum of the epithelium where the fungus resides. Metabolic adaptation of isolate 101 was also reflected in enhanced nutrient acquisition when grown on oral mucosa substrates. Persistent colonization of the oral mucosa by C. albicans also correlated inversely with the capacity of the fungus to induce epithelial cell damage and to elicit an inflammatory response. Here we show that these immune evasive properties of isolate 101 are explained by a strong attenuation of a number of virulence genes, including those linked to filamentation. De-repression of the hyphal program by deletion or conditional repression of NRG1 abolished the commensal behaviour of isolate 101, thereby establishing a central role of this factor in the commensal lifestyle of C. albicans in the oral niche of the host.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe oral microbiota represents an important part of the human microbiota and includes several hundreds to several thousands of bacterial and fungal species. One of the most prominent fungus colonizing the oral cavity is the yeast Candida albicans. While the presence of C. albicans usually remains unnoticed, the fungus can under certain circumstances cause lesions on the lining of the mouth referred to as oral thrush or contribute to other common oral diseases such as caries. Maintaining C. albicans commensalism in the oral mucosa is therefore of utmost importance for oral health and overall wellbeing. While overt fungal growth and disease is limited by immunosurveillance mechanisms during homeostasis, C. albicans strives to survive and evades elimination from the host. Here, we show that while commensalism in the oral cavity is characterized by a restricted fungal virulence and hyphal program, enforcing filamentation in a commensal isolate is sufficient for driving pathogenicity and fungus-induced inflammation in the oral mucosa thwarting persistent colonization. Our results further support a critical role for specialized nutrient acquisition allowing the fungus to thrive in the nutrient poor environment of the squamous epithelium. Together, this work revealed key determinants of C. albicans commensalism in the oral niche.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases is a coordinated process involving metabolic dysfunctions and immune response--usually modulated by the production of cytokines and associated inflammatory molecules. In this work, we seek to understand how genes involved in pathogenesis which are often not associated with the immune system in an obvious way communicate with the immune system. We have embedded a network of human protein-protein interactions (PPI) from the STRING database with 14,707 human genes using feature learning that captures high confidence edges. We have found that our predicted Association Scores derived from the features extracted from STRINGs high confidence edges are useful for predicting novel connections between genes, thus enabling the construction of a full map of predicted associations for all possible pairs between 14,707 human genes. In particular, we analyzed the pattern of associations for 126 cytokines and found that the six patterns of cytokine interaction with human genes are consistent with their functional classifications. In order to define the disease-specific roles of cytokines we have collected gene sets for 11,944 diseases from DisGeNET. We used these gene sets to predict disease-specific gene associations with cytokines by calculating the normalized average Association Scores between disease-associated gene sets and the 126 cytokines; this creates a unique profile of inflammatory genes (both known and predicted) for each disease. We validated our predicted cytokine associations by comparing them to known associations for 171 diseases. The predicted cytokine profiles correlate (p-value<0.05) with the known ones in 147 diseases. We further characterized the profiles of each disease by calculating an \"Inflammation Score\" that summarizes different modes of immune responses. Finally, by analyzing subnetworks formed between disease-specific pathogenesis genes, hormones, receptors, and cytokines, we identified the key genes responsible for interactions between pathogenesis and inflammatory responses. These genes and the corresponding cytokines used by different immune disorders suggest unique targets for drug discovery.",

Predicting the hydrogen bonding network from the sequence, also referred to as RNA secondary structure prediction or RNA folding, is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete computational problem. The structure of the molecule is strongly predictive of its functions and biochemical properties, and therefore the ability to accurately predict the structure is a crucial tool for biochemists. Many methods have been proposed to efficiently sample possible secondary structure patterns. Classic approaches employ dynamic programming, and recent studies have explored approaches inspired by evolutionary algorithms. This work demonstrates leveraging quantum computing hardware to predict the secondary structure of RNA. A Hamiltonian written in the form of a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) is derived to drive the system toward maximizing the number of base pairs while simultaneously maximizing the average length of the stems. An Adiabatic Quantum Computer (AQC) is compared to a Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm programmed with the same objective function, with the AQC being shown to be highly competitive at rapidly identifying low energy solutions. The method proposed in this study was compared to three algorithms from literature and was found to have the highest success rate.",

By identifying putative regions of the genome that contain adaptive mutations, we are able to learn about the biology of organisms and their evolutionary history. Here we introduce a composite likelihood method that identifies recently completed or ongoing positive selection by searching for extreme distortions in the spatial distribution of the haplotype frequency spectrum along the genome relative to the genome-wide expectation taken as neutrality. Furthermore, the method simultaneously infers two parameters of the sweep: the number of sweeping haplotypes and the \"width\" of the sweep, which is related to the strength and timing of selection. We demonstrate that this method outperforms the leading haplotype-based selection statistics. As a positive control, we apply it to two well-studied human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and examine haplotype frequency spectrum patterns at the LCT and MHC loci. We also apply it to a data set of brown rats sampled in NYC and identify genes related to olfactory perception.

Yet, such recordings reflect the combined activity of multiple underlying generators, confounding the ability to resolve spatially distinct neural sources. To empirically quantify the listening zone of icEEG recordings, we computed the correlations between signals as a function of distance (expressed as full width at half maximum; FWHM) between 8,752 recording sites in 71 patients implanted with either subdural electrodes (SDE), stereo-encephalography electrodes (sEEG), or high-density sEEG electrodes. As expected, for both SDE and sEEG electrodes, higher frequency signals exhibited a sharper fall off relative to lower frequency signals. For broadband high gamma (BHG) activity, the mean FWHM of SDEs (6.6 {+/-} 2.5 mm) and sEEGs in gray matter (7.14 {+/-} 1.7 mm) was not significantly different, however the FWHM for low frequencies recorded by sEEGs was 2.45 mm smaller than SDEs. White matter sEEG electrodes showed much lower power for frequencies 17 to 200 Hz (q < 0.01) and a much broader decay (11.3 {+/-} 3.2 mm) than gray matter electrodes (7.14 {+/-} 1.7 mm). The use of a bipolar referencing scheme significantly lowered FWHM for sEEG electrodes, as compared with a white matter reference or a common average reference. These results outline the influence of array design, spectral bands, and referencing schema on local field potential recordings and source localization in icEEG recordings in humans.

Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the Drosophila lobula neuropil by performing connectivity- and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.",

The sequestration of IL-18 by its soluble decoy receptor IL-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP) is critical to the regulation of IL-18 activity. Since an imbalance in expression and circulating levels of IL-18 is associated with disease, structural insights into how IL-18BP outcompetes binding of IL-18 by its cognate cell-surface receptors would be highly desirable. However, the structure of human IL-18BP in complex with IL-18 had remained elusive. Here, we elucidate the sequestration mechanism of human IL-18 mediated by IL-18BP based on the crystal structure of the IL-18:IL-18BP complex. These detailed structural snapshots reveal the interaction landscape leading to the ultra-high affinity of IL-18BP towards IL-18 and identify substantial differences with respect to previously characterized complexes of IL-18 with IL-18BP of viral origin. Furthermore, our structure captured a fortuitous higher-order assembly between IL-18 and IL-18BP coordinated by a disulfide-bond distal to the binding surface connecting IL-18 and IL-18BP molecule from different complexes, resulting in a novel complex with 2:2 stoichiometry. This tetrapartite assembly was found to restrain IL-18 activity more effectively than the canonical 1:1 complex. Collectively, our findings will provide a framework for innovative structure-driven therapeutic strategies and further functional interrogation of IL-18 in physiology and disease.\n\nSignificance statementElevated levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) have long been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases while also displaying potent anti-tumoral activities. Recent research on COVID-19 has now underscored the role of IL-18 and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a soluble receptor serving to regulate IL-18 activity, as key players in viral immunity and as promising biomarkers and predictors of disease severity. In this work, we present detailed structural insights into how human IL-18 and IL-18BP interact thereby completing the structural repertoire of IL-18 in complex with its cognate human receptors and viral decoy receptors. Our findings will support structure-based efforts to either disrupt or enhance the interactions of IL-18 with its cognate receptors for therapeutic purposes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundEpigenetic clocks based on patterns of DNA methylation have great importance in understanding aging and disease; however, there are basic questions to be resolved in their application. It remains unknown whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) within an individual shows strong correlation between different primary tissue sites, the extent to which tissue pathology and clinical illness correlates with EAA in the target organ, and if EAA variability across tissues differs according to sex. Considering the outsized role of age-related illness in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV), these questions were pursued in a sample enriched for tissue from HIV-infected individuals.\n\nMethodsWe used a custom methylation array to generate DNA methylation data from 661 samples representing 11 human tissues (adipose, blood, bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, muscle, spleen, and pituitary gland) from 133 clinically-characterized, deceased individuals, including 75 infected with HIV. We developed a multimorbidity index based on the clinical disease history.\n\nResultsEpigenetic age was moderately correlated across tissues. Blood had the greatest number and degree of correlation, most notably with spleen and bone marrow. However, blood did not correlate with epigenetic age of liver. EAA in liver was weakly correlated with EAA in kidney, adipose, lung, and bone marrow. Clinically, hypertension was associated with EAA in several tissues, consistent with the multi-organ impacts of this illness. HIV infection was associated with positive age acceleration in kidney and spleen. Male sex was associated with increased epigenetic acceleration in several tissues. Preliminary evidence indicates that Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is associated with positive EAA in muscle tissue. Finally, greater multimorbidity was associated with greater EAA across all tissues.\n\nConclusionBlood alone will often fail to detect EAA in other tissues. While hypertension is associated with increased EAA in several tissues, many pathologies are associated with organ-specific age acceleration.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Monitoring the depth of unconsciousness during anesthesia is useful in both clinical settings and neuroscience investigations to understand brain mechanisms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as an objective means of characterizing brain altered arousal and/or cognition states induced by anesthetics in real-time. Different general anesthetics affect cerebral electrical activities in different ways. However, the performance of conventional machine learning models on EEG data is unsatisfactory due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the EEG signals, especially in the office-based anesthesia EEG setting. Deep learning models have been used widely in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to perform classification and pattern recognition tasks due to their capability of good generalization and handling noises. Compared to other BCI applications, where deep learning has demonstrated encouraging results, the deep learning approach for classifying different brain consciousness states under anesthesia has been much less investigated. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on meta-learning using deep neural networks, named Anes-MetaNet, to classify brain states under anesthetics. The Anes-MetaNet is composed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract power spectrum features, and a time consequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks to capture the temporal dependencies, and a meta-learning framework to handle large cross-subject variability. We used a multi-stage training paradigm to improve the performance, which is justified by visualizing the high-level feature mapping. Experiments on the office-based anesthesia EEG dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Anes-MetaNet by comparison of existing methods.",

While written words can be considered as a special type of visual objects, it is unknown whether magnocellular facilitation also plays a role in reading. We used a masked priming paradigm that has been shown to result in neural facilitation in visual word processing and tested whether these facilitating effects are mediated by the magnocellular system. In two experiments, we manipulated the influence of magnocellular and parvocellular systems on visual processing of a contextually predictable target character by contrasting high versus low spatial frequency and luminance versus color contrast, respectively. In addition, unchanged (normal) primes were included in both experiments as a manipulation check. As expected, unchanged primes elicited typical repetition effects in the N1, N250 and P3 components of the ERP in both experiments. In the experiment manipulating spatial contrast, we obtained repetition effects only for the N1 component for both M- and P-biased primes. In the luminance versus color contrast experiment, repetition effects were found in N1 and N250 for both M- and P- biased primes. Furthermore, no interactions were found between M- vs. P-biased prime types and repetition. Together these results indicate that M- and P- information contributes jointly to early neural processes underlying visual word recognition.",

Recently it has been shown that zinc is able to induce tau aggregation by interacting with several binding sites. However, the precise location of these sites and the molecular mechanism of zinc-induced aggregation remain unknown. Here we used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to identify zinc binding sites on hTau40 isoform. These experiments revealed three distinct zinc binding sites on tau, located in the N-terminal part (H14, H32, H94, and H121), the repeat region (H299, C322, H329 and H330) and the C-terminal part (H362, H374, H388 and H407). Further analysis enabled us to show that the C-terminal and the N-terminal sites are independent of each other. Using molecular simulations, we modeled the structure of each site in a complex with zinc. Given the clinical importance of zinc in tau aggregation, our findings pave the way for designing potential therapies for tauopathies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIZinc is known to induce tau aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases\nC_LIO_LIZinc binding locations and mechanism are not yet clear\nC_LIO_LIUsing NMR we localized 3 zinc binding site on tau\nC_LIO_LIBy molecular simulations, we proposed a modeled structure of each site\nC_LIO_LIOur findings pave the way for designing potential therapies for tauopathies\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundMany transcription factors (TFs), such as multi zinc-finger (ZF) TFs, have multiple DNA binding domains (DBDs) with multiple components, and deciphering the DNA binding motifs of individual components is a major challenge. One example of such a TF is CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a TF with eleven ZFs that plays a variety of roles in transcriptional regulation, most notably anchoring DNA loops. Previous studies found that CTCF zinc fingers (ZFs) 3-7 bind CTCFs core motif and ZFs 9-11 bind a specific upstream motif, but the motifs of ZFs 1-2 have yet to be identified.\n\nResultsWe developed a new approach to identifying the binding motifs of individual DBDs of a TF through analyzing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in which a single DBD is mutated: we train a deep convolutional neural network to predict whether wild-type TF binding sites are preserved in the mutant TF dataset and interpret the model. We applied this approach to mouse CTCF ChIP-seq data and, in addition to identifying the known binding preferences of CTCF ZFs 3-11, we identified a GAG binding motif for ZF1 and a weak ATT binding motif for ZF2. We analyzed other CTCF datasets to provide additional evidence that ZFs 1-2 interact with the motifs we identified, and we found that the presence of the motif for ZF1 is associated with Ctcf peak strength.\n\nConclusionsOur approach can be applied to any TF for which in vivo binding data from both the wild-type and mutated versions of the TF are available, and our findings provide an unprecedently comprehensive understanding of the binding preferences of CTCFs DBDs.",

Its level depends on cell metabolism and environment and was recently shown to play key roles during embryogenesis, contrasting with its long-established role in disease progression. We decided to explore whether the secreted morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh), known to be essential in a variety of biological processes ranging from embryonic development to adult tissue homeostasis and cancers, was part of these interactions. Here, we report that H2O2 levels control key steps of Shh delivery and that physiological in vivo modulation of H2O2 levels changes Shh distribution and tissue patterning. A feedback loop exists in which Shh trafficking controls H2O2 synthesis via a non-canonical BOC-Rac1 pathway, leading to cytoneme growth. Our findings reveal that Shh directly impacts its own distribution, thus providing a molecular explanation for the robustness of morphogenesis to both environmental insults and individual variability.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates viral entry into host cells through binding to the cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 RBD (RBDCoV2) has a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than its highly homologous SARS-CoV RBD (RBDCoV), for which the mechanistic reasons still remain to be elucidated. Here, we used the multiple-replica molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) binding free energy calculations, and interface residue contact network (IRCN) analysis approach to explore the mechanistic origin of different ACE2 binding affinities of these two RBDs. The results demonstrate that, when compared to the RBDCoV2-ACE2 complex, the RBDCoV-ACE2 complex features the enhanced overall structural fluctuations and inter-protein positional movements and increased conformational entropy and diversity. The inter-protein electrostatic attractive interactions are a dominant force in determining the high ACE2 affinities of both RBDs, while the significantly strengthened electrostatic forces of attraction of ACE2 to RBDCoV2 determine the higher ACE2 binding affinity of RBDCoV2 than of RBDCoV. Comprehensive comparative analyses of the residue binding free energy components and IRCNs reveal that, although any RBD residue substitution involved in the charge change can significantly impact the inter-protein electrostatic interaction strength, it is the substitutions at the RBD interface that lead to the overall stronger electrostatic attractive force of RBDCoV2-ACE2, which in turn not only tightens the interface packing and suppresses the dynamics of RBDCoV2-ACE2, but also enhances the ACE2 binding affinity of RBDCoV2 compared to that of RBDCoV. Since the RBD residue substitutions involving gain/loss of the positively/negatively charged residues, in particular those near/at the binding interfaces with the potential to form hydrogen bonds and/or salt bridges with ACE2, can greatly enhance the ACE2 binding affinity, the SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying such mutations should be paid special attention to.",

Under hypoxic conditions, a non-canonical long isoform called L-VEGF is concomitantly expressed with VEGF-A. Once translated, L-VEGF it is proteolytically cleaved to generate N-VEGF and VEGF-A. Interestingly, while VEGF-A is secreted and affects the surrounding cells, N-VEGF is mobilized to the nucleus. This suggests that N-VEGF participates in transcriptional response to hypoxia. In this study, we performed a series of complementary experiments to examine the functional role of N-VEGF. Strikingly, we found that the mere expression of N-VEGF followed by its hypoxia-independent mobilization to the nucleus was sufficient to induce key genes associated with angiogenesis, such as Hif1, VEGF-A isoforms, as well as genes associated with cell survival under hypoxia. Complementarily, when N-VEGF was genetically depleted, key hypoxia-induced genes were downregulated and cells were significantly susceptible to hypoxia-mediated apoptosis. This is the first reports of N-VEGF serving as an autoregulatory arm of VEGF-A. Further experiments will be needed to determine the role of N-VEGF in cancer and embryogenesis.",

Mutualistic interactions can help species sustain each other when their environment worsens. However, mutualism is often costly to maintain, and evolution might counter-select it when not profitable enough. We investigate how evolution of mutualism affects the coexistence of two mutualistic species, e.g. a plant-pollinator or plant-fungi system. Specifically, using eco-evolutionary dynamics, we study the evolution of the focal species investment in the mutualistic interaction of a focal species (e.g. plant attractiveness via flower or nectar production for pollinators or carbon exudate for mycorrhizal fungi), and how it is affected by the decline of the partner population with which it is interacting. We assume an allocation trade-off so that investment in the mutualistic interaction reduces the species intrinsic growth rate. First, we investigate how evolution changes species persistence, biomass production, and the intensity of the mutualistic interaction. We show that concave trade-offs allow evolutionary convergence to stable coexistence. We next assume an external disturbance that decreases the partner population by lowering its intrinsic growth rate. Such declines result in the evolution of lower investment of the focal species in the mutualistic interaction, which eventually leads to the extinction of the partner species. With asymmetric mutualism favouring the partner, the evolutionary disappearance of the mutualistic interaction is delayed. Our results suggest that evolution may account for the current collapse of some mutualistic system like plant-pollinator ones, and that restoration attempts should be enforced early enough to prevent potential negative effects driven by evolution.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Microscopy is mostly the method of choice to analyse biofilms. Due to the high local heterogeneity of biofilms, single and punctual analyses only give an incomplete insight into the local distribution of biofilms. In order to retrieve statistically significant results a quantitative method for biofilm thickness measurements was developed based on confocal laser scanning microscopy and the programming language R. The R-script allows the analysis of large image volumes with little hands-on work and outputs statistical information on homogeneity of surface coverage and overall biofilm thickness. The applicability of the script was shown in microbial fuel cell experiments. It was found that G. sulfurreducens responds differently to poised anodes of different material so that the optimum potential for MFC on poised ITO anodes had to be identified with respect to maximum current density, biofilm thickness and MFC start-up time. Thereby, a positive correlation between current density and biofilm thickness was found, but with no direct link to the applied potential. The optimum potential turned out to be +0.1 V vs SHE. The script proved to be a valuable stand-alone tool to quantify biofilm thickness in a statistically valid manner, which is required in many studies.\n\nPractical applicationBiofilm communities are ubiquitous. They can be found in every habitat in which water, nutrients and a colonisable surface are present. Depending on the surface, biofilms can cause economic losses due to bio-corrosion (pipelines and ship walls are prominent examples) or are a severe threat to human health when important medical devices or body tissues are colonised [1]. Desirable biofilms are catalytic biofilms how they are used in bioelectrochemical production processes, for example. In all cases, quantitative and qualitative biofilm analysis is necessary in order to prevent or promote biofilm formation. In bioelectrochemistry quantitative biofilm analysis is essential to link productivity (current or chemicals) with biomass deposited on the electrode. Microscopic analysis (e.g. with CLSM) of stained biofilms allows the recording of high volumes of image data but often image analysis then remains at a qualitative stage. In terms of biofilm thickness determination this limits analysis to an estimated thickness of a small amount of images, mostly. The presented R-script allows the calculation of biofilm thickness based on a larger amount of image sets and allows conclusions on the homogeneity of biofilm coverage on the electrode surface. The script is a stand-alone tool if only biofilm thickness should be determined and does not require any image segmentation or processing.",

Neural networks with symmetric synaptic connectivity dominate this framework, but are inconsistent with the diverse synaptic connectivity and neuronal representations observed in experiments. Here, we developed a theory for manifold attractors in trained neural networks, which approximate a continuum of persistent states, without assuming unrealistic symmetry. We exploit the theory to predict how asymmetries in the representation and heterogeneity in the connectivity affect the formation of the manifold via training, shape network response to stimulus, and govern mechanisms that possibly lead to destabilization of the manifold. Our work suggests that the functional properties of manifold attractors in the brain can be inferred from the overlooked asymmetries in connectivity and in the low-dimensional representation of the encoded variable.",

Thus, this process is essential for sexual reproduction and human fertility. Germ cells depend on signals from the somatic gonad to determine their sex, but in organisms such as flies, mice and humans, the sex chromosome genotype of the germ cells is also important for germline sexual development. How somatic signals and germ cell-intrinsic cues act together to regulate germline sex determination is a key question about which little is known. We have found that JAK/STAT signaling in the GSC niche promotes male identity in germ cells and GSCs, in part by activating expression of the epigenetic reader Phf7. We have also found that JAK/STAT signaling is blocked in XX (female) germ cells through the intrinsic action of the sex determination gene Sex lethal, which preserves female identity. Thus, an important function of germline sexual identity is to control how GSCs respond to signals in their niche environment.",

Passive crosslinkers such as -actinin and fascin as well actin nucleator Arp2/3 complex largely determine the architecture and connectivity of actin network patterns; consequently, they regulate network remodeling and membrane shape changes. Membrane constriction in animal cell cytokinesis proceeds by assembly and contraction of a contractile ring pattern rich in -actinin and myosin at the equator of the cell cortex, with which the ring is contiguous. Here we reconstitute actomyosin networks inside cell-sized lipid bilayer vesicles and show that, depending on vesicle size and concentrations of -actinin and fascin, actomyosin networks assemble into ring and aster-like patterns. Anchoring actin to the membrane enhances the interaction of the contractile networks with lipid membrane but does not change the architecture of the patterns. A membrane-bound actomyosin ring exerts force and constricts the membrane. An Arp2/3 complex-mediated actomyosin cortex is shown to assemble a ring-like pattern at the equatorial cortex and contribute to myosin-driven clustering of the cortex and consequently membrane deformation. An active gel theory unifies a model for the observed membrane constriction and protrusion induced by the membrane-bound actomyosin networks.",

Failures to correctly discriminate lures are thought to reflect a failure of pattern separation and a propensity toward pattern completion. Recent research has challenged this perspective, suggesting that poor encoding rather than pattern completion accounts for the occurrence of false alarm responses to similar lures. In two experiments, participants completed a continuous recognition task version of the MST while eye movement (Experiments 1 and 2) and fMRI data (Experiment 2) were collected. In Experiment 1, we replicated the result that fixation counts at study predicted accuracy on lure trials (consistent with poor encoding predicting mnemonic discrimination performance), but this effect was not observed in our fMRI task. In both experiments we found that target-lure similarity was a strong predictor of accuracy on lure trials. Further, we found that fMRI activation changes in the hippocampus were significantly correlated with the number of fixations at study for correct but not incorrect mnemonic discrimination judgments when controlling for target-lure similarity. Our findings indicate that while eye movements during encoding predict subsequent hippocampal activation changes for correct mnemonic discriminations, the predictive power of eye movements for activation changes for incorrect mnemonic discrimination trials was modest at best.",

The main purpose of the present study was to elucidate such extreme adaptability in the brain of an active top wheelchair racing Paralympian (participant P1) who has congenital paraplegia (dysfunction of bilateral lower limbs). Participant P1 has undergone long-term wheelchair racing training using bilateral upper limbs and has won a total of 19 medals in six consecutive summer Paralympic games as of 2021. We examined the functional and structural changes in the foot section of the primary motor cortex (M1) in participant P1 as compared to able-bodied control participants. We also examined the functional and structural changes in three other individuals (participants P2, P3, and P4) with acquired paraplegia, who also had long-term non-use period of the lower limbs and had undergone long-term training for wheelchair sports (but not top athletes at the level of participant P1). We measured brain activity in all the participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when bimanual wrist extension-flexion movement was performed, and the structural MRI images were collected. Compared to 37 control participants, participant P1 showed significantly greater activity in the M1 foot section during the bimanual task, and significant local GM expansion in this section. Significantly greater activity in the M1 foot section was also observed in participant P4, but not in P2 and P3, and the significant local GM expansion was observed in participant P2, but not in P3 and P4. Thus, functional or structural change was observed in an acquired paraplegic participant, but was not observed in all the paraplegic participants. The functional and structural changes typically observed in participant P1 may represent extreme adaptability of the human brain. We discuss the results in terms of a new idea of hyper-adaptation.",

We insert thousands of barcoded transposons carrying a reporter of DNA mismatch repair in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells. Upon inducing a double-strand break between tandem repeats, a mismatch is generated when the single strand annealing repair pathway is used. Regardless of the mismatch, we observed a 60-80% bias in the resolution in favor of one strand. The location of the lesion in the genome and the type of mismatch had little influence on the bias in this context. Instead, changing the position of the double-strand break in the reporter gave a complete reversion of the bias.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that the processing of the double-strand break has a major influence on the repair of mismatches during single-strand annealing, irrespective of the surrounding chromatin context.",

Bioprocess development, systems-level analysis of biocatalyst metabolism, and engineering of cell factories are advancing the widespread deployment of the commercialised technology. Acetogens are particularly attractive biocatalysts but effects of the key physiological parameter - specific growth rate () - on acetogen metabolism and the gas fermentation bioprocess have not been established yet. Here, we investigate the -dependent bioprocess performance of the model-acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum in CO and syngas (CO+CO2+H2) grown chemostat cultures and assess systems-level metabolic responses using gas analysis, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and metabolic modelling. We were able to obtain steady-states up to  ~2.8 day-1 (~0.12 h-1) and show that faster growth supports both higher yields and productivities for reduced by-products ethanol and 2,3-butanediol. Transcriptomics data revealed differential expression of 1,337 genes with increasing  and suggest that C. autoethanogenum uses transcriptional regulation to a large extent for facilitating faster growth. Metabolic modelling showed significantly increased fluxes for faster growing cells that were, however, not accompanied by gene expression changes in key catabolic pathways for CO and H2 metabolism. Cells thus seem to maintain sufficient \"baseline\" gene expression to rapidly respond to CO and H2 availability without delays to kick-start metabolism. Our work advances understanding of transcriptional regulation in acetogens and shows that faster growth of the biocatalyst improves the gas fermentation bioprocess.",

Citrus production worldwide faces challenges from devastating bacterial diseases, including citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri ssp. citri (Xcc). Improving citrus resistance to citrus canker and other major bacterial diseases has been a top priority in citrus biotechnology. Disabling disease susceptibility genes has emerged as a novel, promising approach to engineering disease resistance. The bottleneck for applying such an approach has been the identification of proper disease susceptibility-related genes in citrus. Here we show the first successful case of editing the CsDMR6 gene in citrus and obtaining strong resistance to citrus canker in six mutants in two citrus cultivars,  Duncan grapefruit and Carrizo citrange. Multiple types of deletions and insertions were induced in CsDMR6, resulting in frameshift of its coding region and presumably loss of gene function. The mutation frequency in most of the mutants reached 71.8% to 98.9%. The mutants showed 71.2% to 99.8% reduction in citrus canker lesion and greater than 99.7% or 2.45 to 4.95 Log10 unit reduction in Xcc bacterial cell population. Mutants also accumulated more salicylic acid and expressed much higher levels of the NPR1 gene than the wildtype with or without Xcc inoculation, which suggests potential resistance to other diseases in these mutants. The guide RNAs for targeting CsDMR6 were selected from highly conserved regions and have 100% nucleotide identity with DMR6 homologs in important citrus species; these guide RNAs are expected to work in other important citrus species and cultivars.",

Here we show that an alternative mammalian-specific isoform of the core NMD factor UPF1, termed UPF1LL, enables condition-dependent remodeling of NMD specificity. Previous studies indicate that the extension of a conserved regulatory loop in the UPF1LL helicase core confers a decreased propensity to dissociate from RNA upon ATP hydrolysis relative to the major UPF1 isoform, designated UPF1 SL. Using biochemical and transcriptome-wide approaches, we find that UPF1LL overcomes the protective RNA binding proteins PTBP1 and hnRNP L to preferentially bind and down-regulate long 3UTRs normally shielded from NMD. Unexpectedly, UPF1LL supports induction of NMD on new populations of substrate mRNAs in response to activation of the integrated stress response and impaired translation efficiency. Thus, while canonical NMD is abolished by moderate translational repression, UPF1LL activity is enhanced, providing a mechanism to rapidly rewire NMD specificity in response to cellular stress.",

In vivo spinal cord imaging in mouse models without introducing immunological artifacts is critical to understand spinal cord pathology and discover effective treatments. We developed a minimal-invasive intervertebral window by retaining ligamentum flavum to protect the underlying spinal cord. By introducing an optical clearing method, we achieved repeated two-photon fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering imaging at subcellular resolution with up to 16 imaging sessions over 167 days and observed no inflammatory response. Using this optically cleared intervertebral window, we studied the neuron-glia dynamics following laser axotomy and observed strengthened contact of microglia with the nodes of Ranvier during axonal degeneration. By enabling long-term, repetitive, stable, high-resolution and inflammation-free imaging of mouse spinal cord, our method provides a reliable platform in the research aiming at understanding and treatment of spinal cord pathology.",

Constitutive activation of microglial NF-{kappa}B exacerbated, while inactivation diminished, tau seeding and spreading in PS19 mice, consistent with the observation that NF-{kappa}B activation accelerates processing of internalized tau fibrils in primary microglia. Remarkably, inhibition of microglial NF-{kappa}B specifically also rescued tau-mediated learning and memory deficits, and restored overall transcriptomic changes while increasing tau inclusions. On a single cell level, we discovered that tau-associated disease states in microglia were diminished by NF-{kappa}B inactivation and further transformed by constitutive NF-{kappa}B activation.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe amount of HBV RNA in peripheral blood may reflect HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) transcriptional activity within infected hepatocytes. Quantification of circulating HBV RNA (cirB-RNA) is thus a promising biomarker for monitoring antiviral treatment.\n\nObjectivesWe evaluated the performance of an automated, prototype quantitative HBV RNA assay for use on the Roche cobas(R) 6800/8800 systems.\n\nStudy DesignThe sensitivity, specificity, linearity, and potential interference by HBV DNA of the cobas(R) HBV RNA assay were assessed using synthetic HBV armored RNA and clinical specimens.\n\nResultscobas(R) HBV RNA results were linear between 10 and 107 copies/mL in clinical samples of several HBV genotypes, and up to 109 copies/mL with synthetic RNA. Precision and reproducibility were excellent, with standard deviation below 0.15 log10 copies/mL and coefficients of variation below 5% throughout the linear range. The presence of HBV DNA had minimal (<0.3 log10 copies/mL) impact on HBV RNA quantification at DNA:RNA ratios of up to approximately one million. In a panel of 36 untreated patient samples, cirB-RNA concentrations were approximately 200-fold lower than HBV DNA. cirB-RNA was detected in all 13 HBeAg-positive patients (mean 6.0 log10 copies/mL), and in 20 of 23 HBeAg-negative patients (mean of quantifiable samples 2.2 log10 copies/mL). Finally, cirB-RNA was detected in 12 of 20 nucleoside analog-treated patients (mean of quantifiable samples 3.4 log10 copies/mL).\n\nConclusionsThe cobas(R) 6800/8800 investigational HBV RNA assay is a high throughput, sensitive and inclusive assay to evaluate the clinical relevance of cirB-RNA quantification in patients with chronic hepatitis B.",

Fish especially have a wide range of sex determining systems. While incompatible systems are thought to increase reproductive isolation, interspecific hybridization is common among groups such as cyprinid minnows, thus, studies such as this can provide insight into hybridization and evolutionary diversification of this clade. In the present study, we aimed to identify a genetic basis for sex determination in the common creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. No sex-associated markers were found by RADSex or a GWAS using GEMMA, however, our Weir and Cockerham locus-specific FST analysis and discriminant analysis of principal components revealed some genetic differentiation between the sexes at several loci. While no explicit sex determination mechanism has been yet discovered in creek chub, these loci are potential candidates for future studies. This study also highlights technical challenges involved in studying sex determination in species with extremely variable mechanisms.",

Individuals segment sequences into chunks of items to perform visuo-motor tasks more fluidly, rapidly, and accurately. However, the exact dynamics of chunking processes in the case of extended practice remain unclear. Using an operant conditioning device, eighteen Guinea baboons (Papio papio) produced a fixed sequence of nine movements during 1,000 trials by pointing to a moving target on a touch screen. Response times analyses revealed a specific chunking pattern of the sequence for each baboon. More importantly, we found that these patterns evolved during the course of the experiment, with chunks becoming progressively fewer and longer. We identified two chunk reorganization mechanisms: the recombination of preexisting chunks and the concatenation of two distinct chunks into a single one. These results provide new evidence on chunking mechanisms in sequence learning and challenge current models of associative and statistical learning.",

To date, vaccines are available in the developed countries to prevent the infection of this virus, however, medicines are necessary to help control COVID-19. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) causes the common cold. The main protease (Mpro) is an essential enzyme required for the multiplication of these two viruses in the host cells, and thus is an appropriate candidate to screen potential medicinal compounds. Flavonols and dihydroflavonols are two groups of plant flavonoids. In this study, we report docking simulation with two Mpro enzymes and five flavonols and three dihydroflavonols, in vitro inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and in vitro inhibition of the HCoV 229E replication. The docking simulation results predicted that (+)-dihydrokaempferol, (+)-dihydroquercetin, (+)-dihydromyricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricentin, isoquercetin, and rutin could bind to at least two subsites (S1, S1, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket and inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Their affinity scores ranged from -8.8 to -7.4. Likewise, these compounds were predicted to bind and inhibit the HCoV-229E Mpro activity with affinity scores ranging from -7.1 to -7.8. In vitro inhibition assays showed that seven available compounds effectively inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity and their IC50 values ranged from 0.125 to 12.9 {micro}M. Five compounds inhibited the replication of HCoV-229E in Huh-7 cells. These findings indicate that these antioxidative flavonols and dihydroflavonols are promising candidates for curbing the two viruses.",

It has been proposed that anesthetics selectively prevent consciousness and memory via acting on microtubules (MTs). It is known that the magnetic field modulates MT organization. A recent study shows that a radical pair model can explain the isotope effect in xenon-induced anesthesia and predicts magnetic field effects on anesthetic potency. Further, reactive oxygen species are also implicated in MT stability and anesthesia. Based on a simple radical pair mechanism model and a simple mathematical model of MT organization, we show that magnetic fields can modulate spin dynamics of naturally occurring radical pairs in MT. We show that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the reaction cycle, which translates into a change in the MT density. We can reproduce magnetic field effects on the MT concentration that have been observed. Our model also predicts additional effects at slightly higher fields. Our model further predicts that the effect of zinc on the MT density exhibits isotopic dependence. The findings of this work make a connection between microtubule-based and radical pair-based quantum theories of consciousness.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Linkage disequilibrium and disease-associated variants in non-coding regions make it difficult to distinguish truly associated genes from redundantly associated genes for complex diseases. In this study, we proposed a new conditional gene-based framework called MCGA that leveraged an improved effective chi-squared statistic to control the type I error rates and remove the redundant associations. MCGA initially integrated two conventional strategies to map genetic variants to genes, i.e., mapping a variant to its physically nearby gene and mapping a variant to a gene if the variant is a gene-level expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of the gene. We further performed a simulation study and demonstrated that the isoform-level eQTL was more powerful than the gene-level eQTL in the association analysis. Then the third strategy, i.e., mapping a variant to a gene if the variant is an isoform-level eQTL of the gene, was also integrated with MCGA. We applied MCGA to predict the potential susceptibility genes of schizophrenia and found that the potential susceptibility genes identified by MCGA were enriched with many neuronal or synaptic signaling-related terms in the Gene Ontology knowledgebase and antipsychotics-gene interaction terms in the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb). More importantly, nine susceptibility genes were the target genes of multiple approved antipsychotics in DrugBank. Comparing the susceptibility genes identified by the above three strategies implied that strategy based on isoform-level eQTL could be an important supplement for the other two strategies and help predict more candidate susceptibility isoforms and genes for complex diseases in a multi-tissue context.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) leads with high frequency to congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), whose worst outcome is microcephaly. However, the mechanisms of congenital ZIKV neurodevelopmental pathologies, including direct cytotoxicity to neural progenitor cells (NPC), placental insufficiency, and immune responses, remain incompletely understood. At the cellular level, microcephaly typically results from death or insufficient proliferation of NPC or cortical neurons. NPCs replicate fast, requiring efficient DNA damage responses to ensure genome stability. Like congenital ZIKV infection, mutations in the polynucleotide 5-kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP) gene, which encodes a critical DNA damage repair enzyme, results in recessive syndromes often characterized by congenital microcephaly with seizures (MCSZ). We thus tested whether there were any links between ZIKV and PNKP.\n\nHere we show that two PNKP phosphatase inhibitors or PNKP knockout inhibited ZIKV replication. PNKP relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells, co-localizing with the marker of ZIKV replication factories (RF) NS1 and resulting in functional nuclear PNKP depletion. Although infected NPC accumulated DNA damage, they failed to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. ZIKV also induced activation of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 complexes, which trigger unscheduled mitotic entry. Inhibition of CDK1 activity inhibited ZIKV replication and the formation of RF, supporting a role of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 in RF morphogenesis. In brief, ZIKV infection induces mitotic catastrophe resulting from unscheduled mitotic entry in the presence of DNA damage. PNKP and CycA/CDK1 are thus host factors participating in ZIKV replication in NPC, and pathogenesis to neural progenitor cells.\n\nSignificanceThe 2015-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil and subsequent international epidemic revealed the strong association between ZIKV infection and congenital malformations, mostly neurodevelopmental defects up to microcephaly. The scale and global expansion of the epidemic, the new ZIKV outbreaks (Kerala state, India, 2021), and the potential burden of future ones pose a serious ongoing risk. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms resulting in microcephaly remain incompletely understood. Here we show that ZIKV infection of neuronal progenitor cells results in cytoplasmic sequestration of an essential DNA repair protein itself associated with microcephaly, with the consequent accumulation of DNA damage, together with an unscheduled activation of cytoplasmic CDK1/Cyclin A complexes in the presence of DNA damage. These alterations result in mitotic catastrophe of neuronal progenitors, which would lead to a depletion of cortical neurons during development.",

Following a single intramuscular immunization, the rACAM2000 co-expressing the spike and nucleocapsid proteins induced significantly improved protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in comparison to rACAM2000 expressing the individual proteins in a hamster model, as shown by reduced weight loss and quicker recovery time.

In the B-type spermatogonial cells, Sox8 is regulated by the lncRNA Mrhl in a p68-dependant manner under the control of the Wnt signalling pathway. The downregulation of Mrhl leads to the meiotic commitment of the spermatogonial cells in a Sox8-dependant manner. While the molecular players involved in the regulation of transcription at the Sox8 promoter have been worked out, our current study points to the involvement of the architectural proteins CTCF and cohesin in mediating a chromatin loop that brings the Sox8 promoter in contact with a silencer element present within the gene body in the presence of lncRNA Mrhl concomitant with transcriptional repression. Further, lncRNA Mrhl interacts with the Sox8 locus through the formation of a DNA:DNA:RNA triplex which is necessary for the recruitment of PRC2 to the locus. The downregulation of lncRNA Mrhl results in the promoter-silencer loop giving way to a promoter-enhancer loop. This active transcription associated chromatin loop is mediated by YY1 and brings the promoter in contact with the enhancer present downstream of the gene.",

An exceptional situation exists in monitor lizards and pythons, where the ventricular left side generates a much higher systolic blood pressure than the right side, thus resembling mammals and birds. This functional division of the ventricle depends on a large muscular ridge and may relate to high metabolic demand. The large leatherback turtle (<1000 kg), with its active ocean-going lifestyle and elevated body temperatures, may have similar adaptations. Here, we report on the anatomy the hearts of two leatherback turtles. One stranded in Ballum, Denmark in 2020, and was examined in detail, supplemented by observations and photos of an additional stranding specimen from Canada. The external morphology of the leatherback heart resembles that of other turtles, but it is large. We made morphometric measurements of the Ballum heart and created an interactive 3D model using high resolution MRI. The volume of the ventricle was 950 ml, from a turtle of 300 kg, which is almost twice as large as in other reptiles. The Ballum heart was compared to MRI scans of the hearts of a tortoise, a python, and a monitor lizard. Internally, the leatherback heart is typical of non-crocodylian reptiles, and did not contain the well-developed septation found in pythons and monitor lizards. We conclude that if leatherback turtles have exceptional circulation needs, they are sustained with a relatively large but otherwise typical non-crocodylian reptile heart.",

Yet existing indices have important shortcomings, including that they are unsuited to the tree types commonly used to describe the evolution of tumours, microbial populations, and cell lines. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, we define a new class of robust, universal tree balance indices. These indices take a form similar to Colless index but account for node sizes, are defined for trees with any degree distribution, and enable more meaningful comparison of trees with different numbers of leaves. Second, we show that for bifurcating and all other full m-ary cladograms (in which every internal node has the same out-degree), one such Colless-like index is equivalent to the normalised reciprocal of Sackins index. Hence we both unify and generalise the two most popular existing tree balance indices. Our indices are intrinsically normalised and can be computed in linear time. We conclude that these more widely applicable indices have potential to supersede those in current use.",

    "preprint_abstract": "DNA methylation plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, as evidenced by the male sterility of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mutant mice. Here, we report a striking division of labor in the establishment of the methylation landscape of male germ cells and its functions in spermatogenesis: while DNMT3C is essential for preventing retrotransposons from interfering with meiosis, DNMT3A broadly methylates the genome--at the exception of DNMT3C-dependent retrotransposons--and controls spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) plasticity. By reconstructing developmental trajectories through single-cell RNA-seq and by profiling chromatin states, we found that Dnmt3A mutant SSCs can only self-renew and no longer differentiate due to spurious enhancer activation that enforces an irreversible stem cell gene program. We therefore provide a novel function for DNA methylation in male fertility: the epigenetic programming of SSC commitment to differentiation and to life-long spermatogenesis supply.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) measures brain activity at rest, which has been linked with both cognitive and clinical outcomes. The genetic variants influencing human brain function are largely unknown. Here we utilized rsfMRI from 44,190 individuals of multiple ancestries (37,339 in the UK Biobank) to discover and validate the common genetic variants influencing intrinsic brain activity. We identified hundreds of novel genetic loci associated with intrinsic functional signatures (P < 2.8 x 10-11), including associations to the central executive, default mode, and salience networks involved in the triple network model of psychopathology. A number of intrinsic brain activity associated loci colocalized with brain disorder GWAS (e.g., Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia) and cognition, such as 19q13.32, 17q21.31, and 2p16.1. Particularly, we detected a colocalization between one (rs429358) of the two variants in the APOE {varepsilon}4 locus and function of the default mode, central executive, attention, and visual networks. Genetic correlation analysis demonstrated shared genetic influences between brain function and brain structure in the same regions. We also detected significant genetic correlations with 26 other complex traits, such as ADHD, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, intelligence, education, sleep, subjective well-being, and neuroticism. Common variants associated with intrinsic brain activity were enriched within regulatory element in brain tissues.",

The microenvironment of cells often simultaneously contains various cues and the motility response of cells to multiplexed guidance is poorly understood. Here we combine experiments and mathematical models to study the three-dimensional migration of breast cancer cells in the presence of both contact guidance and a chemoattractant gradient. We find that the chemotaxis of cells is complicated by the presence of contact guidance as the microstructure of extracellular matrix (ECM) vary spatially. In the presence of dual guidance, the impact of ECM alignment is determined externally by the coherence of ECM fibers, and internally by cell mechanosensing Rho/Rock pathways. When contact guidance is parallel to the chemical gradient, coherent ECM fibers significantly increase the efficiency of chemotaxis. When contact guidance is perpendicular to the chemical gradient, cells exploit the ECM disorder to locate paths for chemotaxis. Our results underscores the importance of fully characterizing the cancer cell microenvironment in order to better understand invasion and metastasis.",

This investigation begins to address deficiencies in knowledge by examining the kinetics of myonuclear accretion, positioning, and global transcription during injury-induced muscle regeneration in mice. We demonstrate that myonuclear accretion plateaus within 7 d of an injury and that the majority (~70%) of myonuclei are centrally aligned in linear arrays (nuclear chains) throughout the course of regeneration. Relatively few myonuclei were found in a peripheral position (~20%) or clustered (~10%) together during regeneration. Importantly, transcriptional activity of individual myonuclei in nuclear chains was high, and greater than that of peripheral or clustered myonuclei. Transcription occurring primarily in nuclear chains elevated the collective transcriptional activity of regenerating myofibers during the later stage of regeneration. Importantly, the number of myonuclei in chains and their transcriptional activity were statistically correlated with an increase in myofiber size during regeneration. Our findings demonstrate the positional context of transcription during regeneration and highlight the importance of centralized nuclear chains in facilitating hypertrophy of regenerating myofibers after injury.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Gene regulation based on regulatory RNA is an important mechanism in cells and is increasingly used for regulatory circuits in synthetic biology. Toehold switches are rationally designed post-transcriptional riboregulators placed in the 5 untranslated region of mRNA molecules. In the inactive state of a toehold switch, the ribosome-binding site is inaccessible for the ribosome. In the presence of a trigger RNA molecule protein production is turned on. Using antisense RNA against trigger molecules (anti-trigger RNA), gene expression can also be switched off again. We here study the utility and regulatory effect of antisense transcription in this context, which enables a particularly compact circuit design. Our circuits utilize two inducible promoters that separately regulate trigger and anti-trigger transcription, whereas their cognate toehold switch, regulating expression of a reporter protein, is transcribed from a constitutive promoter. We explore various design options for the arrangement of the promoters and demonstrate that the resulting dynamic behavior is strongly influenced by transcriptional interference (TI) effects, leading to more than four-fold differences in expression levels. Our experimental results are consistent with previous findings that enhanced local RNA polymerase concentrations due to active promoters in close proximity lead to an increase in transcriptional activity of the strongest promoter in the circuits. Based on this insight, we selected optimum promoter designs and arrangements for the realization of a genetic circuit comprised of two toehold switches, two triggers and two anti-triggers that function as a post-transcriptional RNA regulatory exclusive OR (XOR) gate.",

However, the current standard to calculate the GRM generally does not take advantage of linkage information and does not reflect the underlying genealogical history of the study sample. Here, we propose a coalescent-informed framework to infer the expected relatedness between pairs of individuals given an ancestral recombination graph (ARG) of the sample. Through extensive simulations we show that the eGRM is an unbiased estimate of latent pairwise genome-wide relatedness and is robust when computed using genealogies inferred from incomplete genetic data. As a result, the eGRM better captures the structure of a population than the canonical GRM, even when using the same genetic information. More importantly, our framework allows a principled approach to estimate the eGRM at different time depths of the ARG, thereby revealing the time-varying nature of population structure in a sample. When applied to genotyping data from a population sample from Northern and Eastern Finland, we find that clustering analysis using the eGRM reveals population structure driven by subpopulations that would not be apparent using the canonical GRM, and that temporally the population model is consistent with recent divergence and expansion. Taken together, our proposed eGRM provides a robust tree-centric estimate of relatedness with wide application to genetic studies.",

Here, we propose a novel speckle-free, beaded-ring pattern for high axial-resolution optical stimulation of neurons in vivo. Using a dye pool and a fluorescent thin-film as samples, we verify that, compared to those with disk patterns, higher axial resolution and better localization ability can be achieved with beaded-ring patterns.

    "preprint_abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and remains the second leading cause of cancer death. While breast cancer mortality has steadily declined over the past decades through medical advances, an alarming disparity in breast cancer mortality has emerged between African American women (AAW) and Caucasian American women (CAW); and new evidence suggests more aggressive behavior of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in AAW may contribute to racial differences in tumor biology and mortality. Progesterone (PRG) is capable of exerting its cellular effects through either its classic, non-classic or combined responses through binding to either classic nuclear PRG receptors (nPRs) or non-classic membrane PRG receptors (mPRs), warranting both pathways an equally important status in PRG-mediated signaling. In our previous report, we demonstrated that the CCM signaling complex (CSC) consisting of CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 proteins can couple both nPRs and mPRs signaling cascades to form a CSC-mPRs-PRG-nPRs (CmPn) signaling network in nPR positive(+) breast cancer cells. In this report, we furthered our research by establishing the CSC-mPRs-PRG (CmP) signaling network in nPR(-) breast cancer cells, demonstrating that a common core mechanism exists, regardless of nPR(+/-) cell type. This is the first report stating that inducible expression patterns exist between CCMs and major mPRs in TNBC cells. Furthermore, we firstly show mPRs in TNBC cells are localized in the nucleus and participate in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in a coordinately synchronized fashion with CCM proteins under steroid actions, following the same cellular distribution as other well-defined steroid hormone receptors. Finally, for the first time, we deconvoluted the CmP signalosome by using multi-omics approaches, which helped us understand key factors within the CmP network, and identify 21 specific biomarkers with potential clinical applications associated with AAW-TNBC tumorigenesis. These novel biomarkers could have immediate clinical implications to dramatically improve health disparities among AAW-TNBCs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Detailed knowledge about plant energy metabolism may aid crop improvements. Using published estimates of flux through central carbon metabolism, we phenotype energy metabolism in illuminated Camelina sativa leaves (grown at 22 {degrees}C, 500 mol photons m-2 s-1) and report several findings. First, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) transfers 3.3% of the NADPH consumed in the Calvin-Benson cycle to the cytosol. NADPH supply proceeds at about 10% of the rate of net carbon assimilation. However, concomitantly respired CO2 accounts for 4.8% of total rubisco activity. Hence, 4.8% of the flux through the Calvin-Benson cycle and photorespiration is spent on supplying cytosolic NADPH, a significant investment. Associated energy requirements exceed the energy output of the OPPP. Thus, autotrophic carbon metabolism is not simply optimised for flux into carbon sinks but sacrifices carbon and energy use efficiency to support cytosolic energy metabolism. To reduce these costs, we suggest bioengineering plants with a repressed cytosolic OPPP, and an inserted cytosolic NADPH-dependent malate dehydrogenase tuned to compensate for the loss in OPPP activity (if required). Second, sucrose cycling is a minor investment in overall leaf energy metabolism but a significant investment in cytosolic energy metabolism. Third, leaf energy balancing strictly requires oxidative phosphorylation, cofactor export from chloroplasts, and peroxisomal NADH import. Fourth, mitochondria are energetically self-sufficient. Fifth, carbon metabolism has an ATP/NADPH demand ratio of 1.52 which is met if [&le;]21.7% of whole electron flux is cyclic. Sixth, electron transport has a photon use efficiency of [&ge;]62%. Lastly, we discuss interactions between the OPPP and the cytosolic oxidation-reduction cycle in supplying leaf cytosolic NADPH.\n\nMain ConclusionThe oxidative pentose phosphate pathway provides cytosolic NADPH yet reduces carbon and energy use efficiency. Repressing this pathway and introducing cytosolic NADPH-dependent malate dehydrogenase may increase crop yields by {approx}5%.",

Metabolic interconnected brain areas of rodents can be detected by positron emission tomography using 18FDG-mPET. Albino CF1 mice at 3 and 18 months of age were separated into 4 groups that received daily subcutaneous injections of either ND (15 mg/kg) or vehicle for 15 days. At the in vivo baseline and on the 14th day, 18FDG-mPET analyses were performed. Hypothalamic pAMPKT172/AMPK protein levels were assessed, and basal mitochondrial respiratory states were evaluated in synaptosomes. A metabolic connectivity network between brain areas was estimated based on 18FDG uptake. We found that ND increased the pAMPKT172/AMPK ratio in both adult and aged mice but induced 18FDG uptake and mitochondrial basal respiration only in adult mice. Furthermore, ND triggered rearrangement in the metabolic connectivity of adult mice and aged mice compared to age-matched controls. Altogether, our findings suggest that ND promotes hypothalamic AMPK activation, and distinct glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity rearrangements in the brains of adult and aged mice.",

Based on the monthly monitoring data from 450 monitoring sites at the provincial borders of 27 provinces in China in 2019, the overall surface water quality at provincial boundaries in China was as follows: 61.7% of the water was classified under Class I-III; and 5%, 8.6%, and 12.2% of the water was classified under Class IV, V, and inferior V, respectively. The main standard items are DO, CODMn, COD, BOD5, NH3-N, and TP. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment-water quality index (CCME-WQI) showed that the provincial boundary water quality exceeded the fair level, and F1 was the most influential factor. Then, 27 factors that directly or indirectly affect the water quality of surface water at the provincial boundaries of 27 provinces were identified, and the indirect influencing factors were integrated into the ecological environmental quality index and human activities quantitative index. Finally, the 27 factors were integrated into six factors, and the relationship between these indicators and CCME-WQI as well as the concentration of influencing elements with respect to regulatory standard limits were analyzed. The proportion of building land was the most significant factor affecting the quality of the aquatic environment in provincial boundaries. In addition, the economic development level, proportion of farmland, and degree of social development were identified as significant influencing factors. The six factors have different degrees of impact on the concentrations of major elements with respect to standard limits. This study basically explores water resource management and offers significant reference and guidelines for the improvement of the quality of surface water at provincial boundaries in China.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Harnessing the plant microbiome has the potential to improve agricultural yields and protect plants against pathogens and/or abiotic stresses, while also relieving economic and environmental costs of crop production. While previous studies have gained valuable insights into the underlying genetics facilitating plant-fungal interactions, these have largely been skewed towards certain fungal clades (e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). Several different phyla of fungi have been shown to positively impact plant growth rates, including Mortierellaceae fungi. However, the extent of the plant growth promotion (PGP) phenotype(s), their underlying mechanism(s), and the impact of bacterial endosymbionts on fungal-plant interactions remain poorly understood for Mortierellaceae. In this study, we focused on the symbiosis between soil fungus Linnemannia elongata (Mortierellaceae) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), as both organisms have high-quality reference genomes and transcriptomes available, and their lifestyles and growth requirements are conducive to research conditions. Further, L. elongata can host bacterial endosymbionts related to Mollicutes and Burkholderia. The role of these endobacteria on facilitating fungal-plant associations, including potentially further promoting plant growth, remains completely unexplored. We measured Arabidopsis aerial growth at early and late life stages, seed production, and used mRNA sequencing to characterize differentially expressed plant genes in response to fungal inoculation with and without bacterial endosymbionts. We found that L. elongata improved aerial plant growth, seed mass and altered the plant transcriptome, including the upregulation of genes involved in plant hormones and \"response to oxidative stress\", \"defense response to bacterium\", and \"defense response to fungus\". Furthermore, the expression of genes in certain phytohormone biosynthetic pathways were found to be modified in plants treated with L. elongata. Notably, the presence of Mollicutes- or Burkholderia-related endosymbionts in Linnemannia did not impact the expression of genes in Arabidopsis or overall growth rates.",

Discovery of effective combination therapies is challenging due to the complexity of the biomolecular landscape of drug responses. Here, we developed the method REFLECT (REcurrent Features Leveraged for Combination Therapies), which integrates machine learning and cancer informatics algorithms. The method maps recurrent co-alteration signatures from multi-omic data across patient cohorts to combination therapies. Using the REFLECT framework, we generated a precision therapy resource matching 2,201 drug combinations to co-alteration signatures across 201 cohorts stratified from 10,392 patients and 33 cancer types. We validated that REFLECT-predicted combinations introduce significantly higher therapeutic benefit through analysis of independent data from comprehensive drug screens. In patient cohorts with immunotherapy response markers, HER2 activation and DNA repair aberrations, we identified therapeutically actionable co-alteration signatures shared across patient sub-cohorts. REFLECT provides a framework to design combination therapies tailored to patient cohorts in data-driven clinical trials.",

Information regarding PepT2 in teleost fish is limited and to date functional data are available from the zebrafish (Danio rerio) only. Here, we report the identification of two slc15a2 genes in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) genome, namely slc15a2a and slc15a2b. The two encoded PepT2 proteins share 87% identity and resemble both structurally and functionally to the canonical vertebrate PepT2 system. The mRNA tissue distribution analyses reveal a widespread distribution of slc15a2a transcripts, being more abundant in the brain and gills, while slc15a2b transcripts are mainly expressed in kidney and distal part of gastrointestinal tract. The function of the two transporters was investigated by heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two- electrode voltage-clamp recordings of transport and presteady-state currents. Both PepT2a and PepT2b in the presence of Gly-Gln elicit pH-dependent and Na+ independent inward currents. The biophysical and kinetic analysis of the recorded currents defined the transport properties, confirming that the two Atlantic salmon PepT2 proteins behave as high-affinity/low-capacity transporters. The recent structures and the previous kinetic schemes of rat and human PepT2 qualitatively account for the characteristics of the two Atlantic salmon proteins.

Genome, transcriptome and proteome databases are already available for a number of model organisms including vertebrates and invertebrates. However, there is insufficient information available for protein sequences of certain invertebrates, such as the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a model organism that has been used highly successfully in elucidating evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of learning and memory, ageing and age-related as well as amyloid-{beta} induced memory decline. In this investigation, we used a bioinformatics approach to designing and benchmarking a comprehensive CNS proteomics database (LymCNS-PDB) for the identification of proteins from the Central Nervous System (CNS) of Lymnaea stagnalis by LC-MS based proteomics. LymCNS-PDB was created by using the Trinity TransDecoder bioinformatics tool to translate amino acid sequences from mRNA transcript assemblies obtained from an existing published Lymnaea stagnalis transcriptomics database. The blast-style MMSeq2 software was used to match all translated sequences to sequences for molluscan proteins (including Lymnaea stagnalis and other molluscs) available from UniProtKB. LymCNS-PDB, which contains 9,628 identified matched proteins, was then benchmarked by performing LC-MS based proteomics analysis with proteins isolated from the CNS of Lymnaea stagnalis. MS/MS analysis using the LymCNS-PDB database led to the identification of 3,810 proteins while only 982 proteins were identified by using a non-specific Molluscan database. LymCNS-PDB provides a valuable tool that will enable us to perform quantitative proteomics analysis to identify a plethora of protein interactomes involved in several CNS functions in Lymnaea stagnalis including learning and memory, aging-related memory decline and others.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition is one of the hallmark pathologies in both sporadic Alzheimers disease (sAD) and autosomal dominant Alzheimers disease (ADAD), the latter of which is caused by mutations in genes involved in A{beta} processing. Despite A{beta} deposition being a centerpiece to both sAD and ADAD, some differences between these AD subtypes have been observed with respect to the spatial pattern of A{beta}. Previous work has shown that the spatial pattern of A{beta} in individuals spanning the sAD spectrum can be reproduced with high accuracy using an epidemic spreading model (ESM), which simulates the diffusion of A{beta} across neuronal connections and is constrained by individual rates of A{beta} production and clearance. However, it has not been investigated whether A{beta} deposition in the rarer ADAD can be modeled in the same way, and if so, how congruent the spreading patterns of A{beta} across sAD and ADAD are. We leverage the ESM as a data-driven approach to probe individual-level variation in the spreading patterns of A{beta} across three different large-scale imaging datasets (2 SAD, 1 ADAD). We applied the ESM separately to the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging initiative (N=737), the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (N=510), and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimers Network (N=249), the latter two of which were processed using an identical pipeline. We assessed inter- and intra-individual model performance in each dataset separately, and further identified the most likely epicenter of A{beta} spread for each individual. Using epicenters defined in previous work in sAD, the ESM provided moderate prediction of the regional pattern of A{beta} deposition across all three datasets. We further find that, while the most likely epicenter for most A{beta}-positive subjects overlaps with the default mode network, 13% of ADAD individuals were best characterized by a striatal origin of A{beta} spread. These subjects were also distinguished by being younger than ADAD subjects with a DMN A{beta} origin, despite having a similar estimated age of symptom onset. Together, our results suggest that most ADAD patients express A{beta} spreading patters similar to those of sAD, but that there may be a subset of ADAD patients with a separate, striatal phenotype.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a complex brain region that is essential for reward function but is also implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases including substance abuse. While decades of research on VTA function have focused on the role of dopaminergic neurons, recent evidence has identified critical roles for VTA GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in reward processes as well. Interestingly, molecular characterization has revealed that subsets of these neurons express genes involved in the transport, synthesis, and vesicular packaging of multiple neurotransmitters, providing evidence for co-release neurons. However, these studies have largely relied on low-throughput methods, and the molecular architecture of the VTA has not been comprehensively examined. Here, we performed single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 21,600 VTA cells from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to generate a transcriptional atlas of the rat VTA. We identified 16 transcriptionally distinct cell types within the VTA, including 7 neuronal populations. Further subclustering revealed several VTA neuronal populations expressing markers for more than one neurotransmitter system, with one cluster exhibiting high expression levels of genes involved in the synthesis and transport of GABA, glutamate, and dopamine. Finally, snRNA-seq enabled the de novo identification of thousands of marker genes for each transcriptionally distinct population, revealing cluster-specific enrichment of gene sets implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as specific phenotypes associated with alcohol and tobacco use. Together, these results highlight the heterogeneity of cellular populations in the VTA and identify novel markers and disease-linked genes enriched in distinct neuronal subtypes.",

SnoRNA-derived fragments sdRNA-D19b and -A24 emerged among the most differentially expressed and were selected for further experimentation. We found that overexpression of either sdRNA significantly increased PC3 (a well-established model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)) cell proliferation, and that sdRNA-D19b overexpression also markedly increased the rate of PC3 cell migration. In addition, both sdRNAs provided drug-specific resistances with sdRNA-D19b levels correlating with paclitaxel resistance and sdRNA-24A conferring dasatinib resistance. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed that two established PCa tumor suppressor genes, CD44 and CDK12, represent targets for sdRNA-D19b and sdRNA-A24 respectively. This outlines a biologically coherent mechanism by which sdRNAs downregulate tumor suppressors in AR-PCa to enhance proliferative and metastatic capabilities and to encourage chemotherapeutic resistance. Aggressive proliferation, rampant metastasis, and recalcitrance to chemotherapy are core characteristics of CRPC that synergize to produce a pathology that ranks 2nd in cancer-related deaths for men. This study defines sdRNA-D19b and -A24 as contributors to AR-PCa potentially providing novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets of use in PCa clinical intervention.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) are a primate species exhibiting strong physiological seasonality in response to environmental energetic constraint. They notably store large amounts of lipids during early winter (EW), which are thereafter mobilized during late winter (LW), when food availability is low. In addition, they develop glucose intolerance in LW only. To decipher how the hepatic mechanisms may support such metabolic flexibility, we analyzed the liver proteome of adult captive male mouse lemurs, which seasonal regulations of metabolism and reproduction are comparable to their wild counterparts, during the phases of either constitution or use of fat reserves. We highlight profound changes that reflect fat accretion in EW at the whole-body level, however, without triggering an ectopic storage of fat in the liver. Moreover, molecular regulations would be in line with the lowering of liver glucose utilization in LW, and thus with reduced tolerance to glucose. However, no major regulation was seen in insulin signaling/resistance pathways, which suggests that glucose intolerance does not reach a pathological stage. Finally, fat mobilization in LW appeared possibly linked to reactivation of the reproductive system and enhanced liver detoxification may reflect an anticipation to return to summer levels of food intake. Altogether, these results show that the physiology of mouse lemurs during winter relies on solid molecular foundations in liver processes to adapt fuel partitioning while avoiding reaching a pathological state despite large lipid fluxes. This work emphasizes how the mouse lemur is of primary interest for identifying molecular mechanisms relevant to biomedical field.",

While a growing body of evidence has solidified AKHs role in modulating the physiological and behavioral responses to metabolic stress, little is known about the upstream endocrine circuit that directly regulates AKH release. We evaluated the AKH-expressing cell transcriptome to identify potential regulatory elements controlling AKH cell activity, and found that a number of receptors show consistent expression levels, including all known dopamine receptors, dopamine ecdysone receptor (DopEcR), Dopamine 2-like receptor (D2R), Dopamine 1-like receptor 2 (DopR2), DopR, and the Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDFR). We tested the consequences of targeted genetic knockdown and found that RNAi elements targeting each dopamine receptor caused a significant reduction in survival under starvation. In contrast, PDFR knockdown significantly extended lifespan under starvation whereas expression of a tethered PDF in AKH cells resulted in a significantly shorter lifespan during starvation. These manipulations also caused various changes in locomotor activity under starvation. Specifically, there were higher amounts of locomotor activity in dopamine receptor knockdowns, in both replete and starved states. PDFR knockdown resulted in increased locomotion during replete conditions and locomotion levels that were comparable to wild-type during starvation. Expression of a membrane-tethered PDF led to decreased locomotion under baseline and starvation. Next, we used live-cell imaging to evaluate the acute effects of the ligands for these receptors (dopamine, ecdysone, and Pigment Dispersing Factor) on AKH cell activation. Dopamine application led to a transient increase in intracellular calcium in a sugar-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that co-application of dopamine and ecdysone led to a complete loss of this response, suggesting that these two hormones are acting antagonistically. We also found that PDF application directly led to an increase in cAMP in AKH cells, and that this response was dependent on expression of the PDFR in AKH cells. Together these results suggest a complex circuit in which multiple hormones act on AKH cells to modulate metabolic state.",

Using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), Nottingham-Indonesia Collaboration for Clinical Research and Training (NICCRAT) initiative has facilitated collaboration between the University of Nottingham and a team in Research Centre for Biotechnology, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia/LIPI) to carry out a small number of SARS-CoV-2 WGS in Indonesia. The ONT offers sequencing advantages that fit within the Indonesian context. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited on GISAID from Southeast and East Asian countries reveal the importance of collecting clinical and demographic metadata and the importance of open access and data sharing.

During tumour evolution, disruption of these functional redundancies can create de novo vulnerabilities that are specific to cancer cells. In this regard, paralog genes are of particular interest, as the loss of one paralog gene can render tumour cells dependent on a remaining paralog. To systematically identify cancer-relevant paralog dependencies, we searched for candidate dependencies using CRISPR screens and publicly available loss-of-function datasets. Our analysis revealed >2,000 potential candidate dependencies, several of which were subsequently experimentally validated. We provide evidence that DNAJC15-DNAJC19, FAM50A-FAM50B and RPP25-RPP25L are novel cancer relevant paralog dependencies. Importantly, our analysis also revealed unexpected redundancies between sex chromosome genes. We show that chrX- and chrY- encoded paralogs, as exemplified by ZFX-ZFY, DDX3X-DDX3Y and EIF1AX-EIF1AY, are functionally linked so that tumour cell lines from male patients with Y-chromosome loss become exquisitely dependent on the chrX-encoded gene. We therefore propose genetic redundancies between chrX- and chrY- encoded paralogs as a general therapeutic strategy for human tumours that have lost the Y-chromosome.",

In the hippocampus, both neuromodulators affect long-term synaptic plasticity but play different roles in the encoding of uncertainty or predicted reward. Here, we examine the differential role of these modulators on learning speed and cognitive flexibility in a navigational model. We compare two reward-modulated spike time-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) learning rules to describe the action of these neuromodulators. Our results show that the interplay of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) improves overall learning performance and can explain experimentally reported differences in spatial task performance. Furthermore, this system allows us to make predictions regarding spatial reversal learning.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replicates in CD4+ T cells leading to profound T cell loss, immunological dysfunction and AIDS. Determining how HIV-1 shapes the immunological niche in which it resides to create a permissive environment is central to informing efforts to limit pathogenesis, disturb viral reservoirs and achieve a cure. A key roadblock in understanding HIV-T cell interactions is the requirement to activate CD4+ T cells in vitro in order to make them permissive to infection. This dramatically alters T cell biology, obscuring native virus-host interactions. Here we show that HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread permits efficient and productive infection of resting CD4+ T cells without the need for prior activation. Infection is preferential for resting memory T cells, is observed with both CXCR4-tropic virus and CCR5-tropic transmitter-founder viruses and results in virus production and onward spreading infection. Strikingly, we find that HIV-1 infection of resting memory CD4+ T cells primes for induction of a tissue-resident memory (TRM)-like phenotype evidenced by upregulation of TRM markers CD69/CXCR6 alongside co-expression of CD49a, PD-1, CD101 as well as transcription factor Blimp-1. Furthermore, we reveal that HIV-1 initiates a transcriptional program that overlaps with the core TRM transcriptional signature. This reprograming depends on the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr. We propose that HIV-1 infection drives a CD4+ TRM-phenotype potentially sequestering infected cells within tissues to support viral replication and persistence.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Primary infection with Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) results in a persistent lifelong infection due to its ability to establish latent infection. During productive HCMV infection, viral genes are expressed in a coordinated cascade that is characteristic of all herpesviruses and traditionally relies on the dependencies of viral genes on protein synthesis and viral DNA replication. In contrast, the transcriptional landscape associated with HCMV latency is still disputed and poorly understood. Here, we examine viral transcriptomic dynamics during the establishment of both productive and latent HCMV infections. Our temporal measurements reveal that viral gene expression dynamics along productive infection and their dependencies on protein synthesis and viral DNA replication, do not fully align. This illustrates that the regulation of herpesvirus genes does not represent a simple sequential transcriptional cascade, and surprisingly, many viral genes are regulated by multiple independent modules. Using our improved classification of viral gene expression kinetics in conjunction with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of a wide array of chromatin modifiers, we unbiasedly show that a defining characteristic of latent cells is the unique repression of immediate early (IE) genes. Altogether, our findings provide an elaborate definition of HCMV gene expression patterns and reveal novel principles that govern viral gene expression in lytic and latent infection states.",

Cells use the actomyosin cortex to regulate protein distribution on the plasma membrane, but the interplay between membrane binding, cortical movements and protein distribution remains poorly understood. In a polarizing one-cell stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, actomyosin flows transport PAR protein complexes into an anterior cortical domain to establish the anterior-posterior axis of the animal. Oligomerization of a key scaffold protein, PAR-3, is required for aPAR cortical localization and segregation. Although PAR-3 oligomerization is essential for polarization, it remains unclear how oligomer size contributes to aPAR segregation because PAR-3 oligomers are a heterogeneous population of many different sizes. To address this question, we engineered PAR-3 to defined sizes. We report that PAR-3 trimers are necessary and sufficient for PAR-3 function during polarization and later embryo development, while larger PAR-3 clusters are dispensable. Quantitative analysis of PAR-3 diffusion showed that PAR-3 clusters with three or more subunits are transported by frictional drag and experience extensive collisions with the actomyosin cortex. Our study provides a quantitative model for size-dependent protein transportation of membrane proteins by cortical flow.",

Remodeling of endothelial cell-cell junctions promote morphogenetic cellular events while preserving vascular integrity. Here, we have analyzed the dynamics of endothelial cell-cell junctions during lumen formation in angiogenic sprouts. By live-imaging of the formation of intersegmental blood vessels in zebrafish, we demonstrate that lumen expansion is accompanied by the formation of transient finger-shaped junctions. Formation and maintenance of these junctional fingers are positively regulated by blood pressure whereas inhibition of blood flow prevents their formation. Using fluorescent reporters, we show that the tension-sensor Vinculin localizes to junctional fingers. Furthermore, loss of vinculin function, in vinculin a and -b double knockouts, prevents junctional finger formation in angiogenic sprouts, whereas endothelial expression of a vinculin transgene is sufficient to restore junctional fingers. Taken together, our findings suggest a mechanism in which lumen expansion during angiogenesis leads to an increase in junctional tension, which triggers recruitment of vinculin and formation of junctional fingers. We propose that endothelial cells may employ force-dependent junctional remodeling to react to changes in external forces to protect cell-cell contacts and to maintain vascular integrity during sprouting angiogenesis.",

A circadian clock system helps to anticipate and synchronize gene expression with daily stimuli including cyclic light and food intake, which control the central and peripheral clock programs, respectively. Food intake also regulates insulin secretion. How much insulin contributes to the effect of feeding on the entrainment of the clock and rhythmic gene expression remains to be investigated.\n\nAn important component of insulin action is mediated by changes in insulin receptor (IR)-dependent gene expression. In the liver, insulin at high levels controls the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in glucose homeostasis to promote energy storage while repressing the expression of gluconeogenic genes. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), selective hepatic insulin resistance impairs the inhibition of hepatic glucose production while promoting lipid synthesis. This pathogenic process promoting hyperlipidemia as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.\n\nWhile several lines of evidence link such metabolic diseases to defective control of circadian homeostasis, the hypothesis that IR directly synchronizes the clock has not been studied in vivo. Here, we used conditional hepatocyte-restricted gene deletion to evaluate the role of IR in the regulation and oscillation of gene expression as well as in the programming of the circadian clock in adult mouse liver.",

This wiring specificity can result from synapse formation mechanisms that interconnect neurons depending on their activity or genetically defined identity. Here we report that in addition to these synapse formation mechanisms, the structural composition of the neuropil provides a third prominent source by which wiring specificity emerges in cortical networks. This structurally determined wiring specificity reflects the packing density, morphological diversity and similarity of the dendritic and axonal processes. The higher these three factors are, the more recurrent the topology of the networks. Conversely, low density, diversity and similarity yield feedforward networks. These principles predict connectivity patterns from subcellular to network scales that are remarkably consistent with empirical observations from a rich body of literature. Thus, cortical network architectures reflect the specific morphological properties of their constituents to much larger degrees than previously thought.",

Targeting post-translational modification (PTM) pathways provides a mechanism by which viruses can broadly and rapidly transform a hostile host environment into a hospitable one. We used quantitative proteomics to measure changes in two PTM types - phosphorylation and ubiquitination - in response to HIV-1 infection with viruses harboring targeted deletions of a subset of HIV-1 genes. PTM analysis revealed a requirement for Aurora kinase A activity in HIV-1 infection and furthermore revealed that AMP-activated kinase activity is modulated during infection via HIV-1 Vif-mediated degradation of B56-containing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Finally, we demonstrated that the Cullin4A-DDB1-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates histone H1 somatic isoforms and that HIV-1 Vpr inhibits this process, leading to defects in DNA repair. Thus, global PTM profiling of infected cells serves as an effective tool for uncovering specific mechanisms of host pathway modulation.",

We show that a slightly modified inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion equation yields a single-channel permeability consistent with the mean first passage time (MFPT)-based method. For milestoning, applying cylindrical and spherical bulk boundary conditions yield consistent MFPT if factoring in the effective bulk concentration. The sensitivity of the MFPT to the output frequency of collective variables is highlighted using the convergence and symmetricity of the inward and outward MFPT profiles. The consistent transport kinetic results from all three methods demonstrated the robustness of MD-based methods in computing ion channel permeation. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed, focusing on the future applications of milestoning in more complex systems.",

A reconciliation of these paradoxical observations is that these individuals actively develop and use higher-order beliefs in order to interpret a chaotic environment. In the present behavioural and fMRI study, we compared delusion-prone individuals (n=20), a trait related to psychotic disorders, with controls (n=23; n=20 in fMRI-part) to study the effect of beliefs on fear learning. We show that instructed fear learning, involving explicit change of beliefs and an associated activation of lateral orbitofrontal cortex, is expressed to a higher degree in delusion-prone subjects.

Parvalbumin positive neurons and their surrounding perineuronal nets (PNNs) are important factors in critical period plasticity and have both been implicated in ASD. PNNs are found in high density within output structures of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, two regions that are densely connected to many other brain areas and have the potential to participate in the diverse array of symptoms present in an ASD diagnosis. The dentate nucleus and globus pallidus were therefore assessed for differences in PNN expression in human postmortem ASD brain tissue. While Purkinje cell loss is a consistent neuropathological finding in ASD, in this cohort, the Purkinje cell targets within the dentate nucleus did not show differences in number of cells with or without a PNN. However, the density of parvalbumin positive neurons with a PNN were significantly reduced in the globus pallidus internus and externus of ASD cases, which was not dependent on seizure status.

CW-domains recognize the methylation state of the fourth lysine on histone 3, and could therefore be viewed as a reader of epigentic information. The specificity towards different methylation states such as me1, me2 or me3 depends on the particular CW subtype. For example, the CW domain of ASHH2-methyltransferase binds preferentially to H3K4me1, MORC3 binds to both H3K4me2 and me3 modifications, while ZCWPW1 is more specific to H3K4me3. The structural basis for these preferential bindings are not well understood, and recent research suggests that a more complete picture will emerge if dynamical and energetic assessments are included in the analysis of interactions. This study uses fold assessment by NMR in combination with mutagenesis, ITC affinity measurements and thermal denaturation studies to investigate possible couplings between ASHH2 CW selectivity towards H3K4me1 and the stabilization of the domain and loops implicated in binding. Key elements of the binding site - the two tryptophans and the 1-helix form and maintain the binding pocket were perturbed by mutagenesis and investigated. Results show that 1-helix maintains the overall stability of the fold via the I915 and L919 residues, and that correct binding consolidates the loops designated {eta}1, {eta}3, as well as the C-terminal. This consolidation is incomplete for H3K4me3 binding to CW, which experiences a decrease in overall thermal stability upon binding. Moreover, loop-mutations not directly involved in the binding site nonetheless affect the equillibrium positions of key residues.",

Samples are usually analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with fragmentation mass spectrometry to acquire informative mass spectral ensembles. Such data is then exploited to establish relationships among analytes or samples (e.g. via molecular networking) and annotate metabolites. However, the comparison of samples profiled in different batches is challenging with current metabolomics methods. Indeed, the experimental variation - changes in chromatographical or mass spectrometric conditions - often hinders the direct comparison of the profiled samples. Here we introduce MEMO - MS2 BasEd SaMple VectOrization - a method allowing to cluster large amounts of chemodiverse samples based on their LC-MS/MS profiles in a retention time agnostic manner. This method is particularly suited for heterogeneous and chemodiverse sample sets. MEMO demonstrated similar clustering performance as state-of-the-art metrics taking into account fragmentation spectra. More importantly, such performance was achieved without the requirement of a prior feature alignment step and in a significantly shorter computational time. MEMO thus allows the comparison of vast ensembles of samples, even when analyzed over long periods of time, and on different chromatographic or mass spectrometry platforms. This new addition to the computational metabolomics toolbox should drastically expand the scope of large-scale comparative analysis.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=66 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474089v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c540c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e07e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198e030org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a6a15e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "The composition of ecologically important moss-associated bacterial communities seems to be mainly driven by host species, but may also be shaped by environmental conditions related with tree-canopy dominance. The moss phyllosphere has been studied in coniferous forests while broadleaf forests remain understudied. To determine if host species or environmental conditions defined by tree-canopy dominance drives the bacterial diversity in the moss phyllosphere, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to quantify changes in bacterial communities as a function of host species (Pleurozium schreberi and Ptilium crista-castrensis) and forest type (coniferous black spruce versus deciduous broadleaf trembling aspen) in eastern Canada. Forest type, not host species, was the main factor affecting moss phyllosphere bacterial community composition, though the interaction of both variables was significant. Bacterial -diversity was highest in spruce forests, while there was greater turnover ({beta}- diversity) and higher {gamma}-diversity in aspen forests. Unexpectedly, Cyanobacteria were much more relatively abundant in aspen than in spruce forests, with the bacterial family Nostocaceae (Cyanobacteria) differing the most between both forest types. Our results suggest that the increasing change in dominance from coniferous to broadleaf trees due to natural and anthropic disturbances is likely to affect the composition of moss-associated bacteria in boreal forests.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Gene drives have shown great promise for suppression of pest populations. These engineered alleles can function by a variety of mechanisms, but the most common is the CRISPR homing drive, which converts wild-type alleles to drive alleles in the germline of heterozygotes. Some potential target species are haplodiploid, in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and thus have only one copy of each chromosome. This prevents drive conversion, a substantial disadvantage compared to diploids where drive conversion can take place in both sexes. Here, we study homing suppression gene drives in haplodiploids and find that a drive targeting a female fertility gene could still be successful. However, such drives are less powerful than in diploids and suffer more from functional resistance alleles. They are substantially more vulnerable to high resistance allele formation in the embryo due to maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNA and also to somatic cleavage activity. Examining spatial models where organisms move over a continuous landscape, we find that haplodiploid suppression drives surprisingly perform nearly as well as in diploids, possibly due to their ability to spread further before inducing strong suppression. Together, these results indicate that gene drive can potentially be used to effectively suppress haplodiploid populations.",

Of particular interest is our recent ability to consider a wider range of genomic variants, not only single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thanks to long-read sequencing technology. We can now identify structural variants (SVs) like insertions, deletions, and other rearrangements, allowing further insights into the genetic architecture of speciation and how different types of variants are involved in species differentiation. Here, we investigated genomic patterns of differentiation between sympatric species pairs (Dwarf and Normal) belonging to the Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) species complex. We assembled the first reference genomes for both C. clupeaformis sp. Normal and C. clupeaformis sp. Dwarf, annotated the transposable elements, and analysed the genomes in the light of related coregonid species. Next, we used a combination of long-read and short-read sequencing to characterize SVs and genotype them at population-scale using genome-graph approaches, showing that SVs cover five times more of the genome than SNPs. We then integrated both SNPs and SVs to investigate the genetic architecture of species differentiation in two different lakes and highlighted an excess of shared outliers of differentiation. In particular, a large fraction of SVs differentiating the two species correspond to insertions or deletions of transposable elements (TEs), suggesting that TE accumulation may represent a key component of genetic divergence between the Dwarf and Normal species. Altogether, our results suggest that SVs may play an important role in speciation and that, by combining second and third generation sequencing, we now have the ability to integrate SVs into speciation genomics.",

However, the behavior of the other LC3 subfamily members has not been explored yet. In the present contribution, a comparative analysis of the interaction of LC3B, LC3A and LC3C with CL-containing model membranes, as well as their ability to translocate to mitochondria was assessed. Binding of LC3A to CL was higher than that of LC3B, and both proteins showed a similar ability to colocalize with mitochondria upon induction of CL externalization by rotenone in HeLa-NDPK-D or SH-SY5Y cells. Two residues located in the N-terminal region of LC3A were shown to be important for its recognition of damaged mitochondria. Moreover, the in vitro results suggested a possible role of LC3A, but not of LC3B, in oxidized-CL recognition as a counterweight to excessive apoptosis activation. In the case of LC3C, even if this protein showed a higher binding than LC3B or LC3A to CL, binding was less specific, and colocalization of LC3C with mitochondria was not rotenonedependent. These results suggest that, at variance with LC3A, LC3C does not participate in the rotenone-CL mitophagy mechanism. The data support the notion that the various LC3/GABARAP family members might play different roles during autophagy initiation, identifying LC3A as a novel stakeholder in CL-mediated mitophagy.",

Memory CD8+ T cells are required for quick expansion into effector cells but also provide immediate cytotoxicity against their targets. Whereas many functions of the two main cytotoxic subtypes, effector memory CD8+ T cells (TEM) and central memory CD8+ T cells (TCM), are relatively well defined, single TEM and TCM cell cytotoxicity has not been quantified. Here, we analyze human CD8+ subtype distribution following SEA stimulation and quantify the expression of death mediators, including perforin, granzyme B, FasL and TRAIL. We find higher perforin, granzyme B and FasL expression in TEM and compared to TCM. To quantify single TEM and TCM cytotoxicity, we develop a FRET-based fluorescent assay with NALM6 target cells stably transfected with a GFP-RFP FRET construct based on a caspase-cleavage sequence (apoptosis sensor Casper-GR). Applying this assay, TEM or TCM induced target cell apoptosis or necrosis can be quantified. We find that single TEM are much more effective than TCM in killing their targets mainly by apoptosis and secondary necrosis. The reason for this is the higher perforin expression and on a more efficient lytic immunological synapse during TEM-target contact compared to TCM-target contact. Defining and quantifying single TEM and TCM cytotoxicity and the respective mechanism should be helpful to optimize future subset-based immune therapies.",

Hence, there is a need for therapeutic strategies eliminating tumor cells with chromothripsis. Defects in DNA double-strand break repair, and in particular homologous recombination repair, have been linked with chromothripsis. Targeting DNA repair deficiencies by synthetic lethality approaches, we performed a synergy screen using drug libraries (n = 375 compounds, 15 models) combined with either a PARP inhibitor or cisplatin.

There are five S1P receptors, designated as S1PR1-5, encoded in the human genome, and their activities are governed by endogenous S1P, lipid-like S1P mimics, or non-lipid-like therapeutic molecules. Among S1PRs, S1PR1 stands out due to its non-redundant functions, such as the egress of T and B cells from the thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues, making it a potential therapeutic target. However, the structural basis of S1PR1 activation and regulation by various agonists remains unclear. Here we reported four atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of Gi-coupled human S1PR1 complexes: bound to endogenous agonist d18:1 S1P, benchmark lipid-like S1P mimic phosphorylated Fingolimod ((S)-FTY720-P), or non-lipid-like therapeutic molecule CBP-307 in two binding modes. Our results revealed the similarities and differences of activation of S1PR1 through distinct ligands binding to the amphiphilic orthosteric pocket. We also proposed a two-step \"shallow to deep\" transition process of CBP-307 for S1PR1 activation. Both binding modes of CBP-307 could activate S1PR1, but from shallow to deep transition may trigger the rotation of the N-terminal helix of Gi and further stabilize the complex by increasing the Gi interaction with the cell membrane. We combine with extensive biochemical analysis and molecular dynamic simulations to suggest key steps of S1P binding and receptor activation. The above results decipher the common feature of the S1PR1 agonist recognition and activation mechanism and will firmly promote the development of therapeutics targeting S1P receptors.",

Here, we selectively introgressed during one year light pigmentation genes of D. santomea into the genome of its dark sibling D. yakuba, and vice versa. We found that the pace of phenotypic change differed between the species and the sexes, and identified through genome sequencing common as well as distinct introgressed loci in each species. Mating assays showed that assortative mating between introgressed flies and both parental species persisted even after four years ([~] 60 generations) from the end of the selection. Those results indicate that selective introgression of as low as 0.5% of the genome can beget morphologically-distinct and reproductively-isolated strains, two prerequisites for the delimitation of new species. Our findings hence represent a significant step towards understanding the genome-wide dynamics of speciation-through-introgression.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Water flow in river networks is frequently regulated by man-made in-stream barriers. These obstacles can hinder dispersal of aquatic organisms and isolate populations leading to the loss of genetic diversity. Although millions of small in-stream barriers exist worldwide, such as weirs below 2 m or tunnels and pipes, their impact on the dispersal of macroinvertebrates with strictly aquatic life cycles is unclear. We therefore assessed the effects of such barriers on the population structure and effective dispersal of five macroinvertebrate species with strictly aquatic life cycles: the amphipod crustacean Gammarus fossarum (clade 11), three snail species of the Ancylus fluviatilis species complex and the flatworm Dugesia gonocephala. We studied populations at nine weirs and eight culverts (3 pipes, 5 tunnels), built 33-109 years ago, in the heavily fragmented catchment of the river Ruhr (Sauerland, Germany). To assess fragmentation and barrier effects, we generated genome-wide SNP data using ddRAD sequencing and evaluated clustering, differentiation between populations up- and downstream of each barrier and effective migration rates among sites and across barriers. Additionally, we applied population genomic simulations to assess expected differentiation patterns under different gene flow scenarios. Our data show that populations of all species are highly isolated at regional and local scales within few kilometres. While the regional population structure likely results from historical processes, the strong local differentiation suggests that contemporary dispersal barriers exist. However, we identified significant barrier effects only for pipes (for A. fluviatilis II and III) and few larger weirs (>1.3 m; for D. gonocephala). Therefore our data suggest that most small in-stream barriers can probably be overcome by all studied taxa frequently enough to prevent fragmentation. Thus, the barriers leading to population isolation after few kilometres still need to be identified. Specifically, it remains to be tested if the strong local differentiation is a result of a cumulative effect of small barriers, or if e.g. larger in-stream barriers, land use, chemical pollution, urbanisation, or a combination of these factors impede gene flow.",

The extensive genetic mixing and high genetic diversity of E. balteatus populations underscore its adaptive capacity to environmental disturbances e.g., climate change. Pollen markers and molecular gut-analysis further illuminate how E. balteatus visits min. 1,012 flowering plant species (39 orders) over space and time. By thus delineating E. balteatus trans-regional movements and pollination networks, we advance our understanding of its migration ecology and facilitate the design of targeted strategies to conserve and enhance its ecosystem services.",

Unfortunately, formulating such mechanistic cell-level models currently relies on hand curation by experts, which can bias how data is interpreted or the priority of drug targets. In modeling molecular-level networks, rules and algorithms have been developed to limit a priori biases in formulating mechanistic models. To realize an equivalent approach for cell-level networks, we combined digital cytometry with Bayesian network inference to generate causal models that link an increase in gene expression associated with onco-genesis with alterations in stromal and immune cell subsets directly from bulk transcriptomic datasets. To illustrate, we predicted how an increase in expression of Cell Communication Network factor 4 (CCN4/WISP1) altered the tumor microenvironment using data from patients diagnosed with breast cancer and melanoma. Digital cytometry and network inference predictions were then tested using two immunocompetent mouse models for melanoma, which provided consistent experimental results.",

Long ExbBs are found in several genera of Alphaproteobacteria, most often in correlation with a hasB gene. We investigated specificity determinants of ExbBSm and HasB. We determined the cryo-EM structures of ExbBSm and of the ExbB-ExbDSm complex from S. marcescens. ExbBSm alone is a stable pentamer, and its complex includes two ExbD monomers. We showed that ExbBSm extension interacts with HasB and is involved in heme acquisition and we identified key residues in the membrane domain of ExbBSm and ExbBEc, essential for function and likely involved in the interaction with TonB/HasB. Our results shed light on the new class of inner membrane energy machinery formed by ExbB,ExbD and HasB.",

It is hypothesized that amyloid-{beta} and tau pathology in preclinical Alzheimers disease (AD) spread through functional networks, disrupting neural communication that results in cognitive dysfunction. We used high-resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses to test whether in vivo amyloid-{beta} and tau burden was associated with the segregation and integration of brain functional connections, and episodic memory, in cognitively-unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers who are expected to develop early-onset AD dementia in approximately 13 years on average. Compared to non-carriers, mutation carriers exhibited less functional segregation and integration in posterior default-mode network (DMN) regions, particularly the precuneus, and in the retrospenial cortex, which has been shown to link medial temporal regions and cortical regions of the DMN. Mutation carriers also showed greater functional segregation and integration in regions connected to the salience network, including the striatum and thalamus. Greater tau burden was associated with lower segregated and integrated functional connectivity of DMN regions, particularly the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex. In turn, greater tau pathology was related to higher segregated and integrated functional connectivity in the retrospenial cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex, a hub of the salience network. These findings enlighten our understanding of how AD-related pathology distinctly alters the brains functional architecture in the preclinical stage, possibly contributing to pathology propagation and ultimately resulting in dementia.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAmyloid-{beta} and tau pathologies in Alzheimers disease (AD) are hypothesized to propagate through functional networks. Research is needed to elucidate how AD-related pathologies alter the brains functional connections years before symptom-onset to help predict pathology accumulation and dementia risk. Using high-resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses and PET imaging, we showed that greater tau burden was associated with largely dysconnectivity of posterior default-mode network brain regions, and increased connectivity of structures associated with the salience network and others that are critical for integrating information across neural systems in cognitively-unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers. Findings enlighten how amyloid-{beta} and tau relate to distinct patterns of functional connectivity in regions that underlie memory functioning and are critical for information processing, helping predict disease progression.",

While efforts have been made to optimize therapy by exploiting drug-drug synergies, testing new drug combinations in relevant host environments remains arduous. In particular, host environments profoundly affect the bacterial metabolic state and drug efficacy, limiting the accuracy of predictions based on in vitro assays alone. In this study, we utilize conditional Mtb knockdown mutants of essential genes as an experimentally-tractable surrogate for drug treatment, and probe the relationship between Mtb carbon metabolism and chemical-genetic interactions (CGI). We examined the anti-tubercular drugs isoniazid, rifampicin and moxifloxacin, and found that CGI are differentially responsive to the metabolic state, defining both environment-independent and -dependent interactions. Specifically, growth on the in vivo-relevant carbon source, cholesterol, reduced rifampicin efficacy by altering mycobacterial cell surface lipid composition. We report that a variety of perturbations in cell wall synthesis pathways restore rifampicin efficacy during growth on cholesterol, and that both environment-independent and cholesterol-dependent in vitro CGI could be leveraged to enhance bacterial clearance in the mouse infection model. Our findings present an atlas of novel chemical-genetic-environmental interactions that can be used to optimize drug-drug interactions as well as provide a framework for understanding in vitro correlates of in vivo efficacy.\n\nSignificanceEfforts to improve tuberculosis therapy include optimizing multi-drug regimens to take advantage of drug-drug synergies. However, the complex host environment has a profound effect on bacterial metabolic state and drug activity, making predictions of optimal drug combinations difficult. In this study, we leverage a newly developed library of conditional knockdown Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants in which genetic depletion of essential genes mimics the effect of drug therapy. This tractable system allowed us to assess the effect of growth condition on predicted drug-drug interactions. We found that these interactions can be differentially sensitive to the metabolic state and select in vitro-defined interactions can be leveraged to accelerate bacterial killing during infection.

    "preprint_abstract": "Human culture, biology, and health were shaped dramatically by the onset of agriculture ~12,000 years before present (BP). Subsistence shifts from hunting and gathering to agriculture are hypothesized to have resulted in increased individual fitness and population growth as evidenced by archaeological and population genomic data alongside a simultaneous decline in physiological health as inferred from paleopathological analyses and stature reconstructions of skeletal remains. A key component of the health decline inference is that relatively shorter statures observed for early farmers may (at least partly) reflect higher childhood disease burdens and poorer nutrition. However, while such stresses can indeed result in growth stunting, height is also highly heritable, and substantial inter-individual variation in the height genetic component within a population is typical. Moreover, extensive migration and gene flow were characteristics of multiple agricultural transitions worldwide. Here, we consider both osteological and ancient DNA data from the same prehistoric individuals to comprehensively study the trajectory of human stature variation as a proxy for health across a transition to agriculture. Specifically, we compared  predicted genetic contributions to height from paleogenomic data and  achieved adult osteological height estimated from long bone measurements on a per-individual basis for n=160 ancient Europeans from sites spanning the Upper Paleolithic to the Iron Age (~38,000-2,400 BP). We found that individuals from the Neolithic were shorter than expected (given their individual polygenic height scores) by an average of -4.47 cm relative to individuals from the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic (P=0.016). The average osteological vs. expected stature then increased relative to the Neolithic over the Copper (+2.67 cm, P=0.052), Bronze (+3.33 cm, P=0.032), and Iron Ages (+3.95 cm, P=0.094). These results were partly attenuated when we accounted for genome-wide genetic ancestry variation in our sample (which we note is partly duplicative with the individual polygenic score information). For example, in this secondary analysis Neolithic individuals were -3.48 cm shorter than expected on average relative to individuals from the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic (P=0.056). We also incorporated observations of paleopathological indicators of non-specific stress that can persist from childhood to adulthood in skeletal remains (linear enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, and porotic hyperostosis) into our model. Overall, our work highlights the potential of integrating disparate datasets to explore proxies of health in prehistory.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Antigen-specific immunotherapy involves the delivery of self-antigens as proteins or peptides (or using nucleic acids encoding them) to be presented with the goal of inducing tolerance. Approaches employing specific epitopes restricted to the subjects MHC haplotypes have multiplied and offer a more focused and tailored way of targeting autoreactive T cells. In addition, the Endotope platform allows endogenously expressed epitopes to be processed and presented on appropriate MHC class I and II molecules. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a DNA vaccine encoding epitopes selected and tailored for the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse compared to the expression of the proinsulin protein, one of the most successful antigens in prevention of NOD disease, and we assessed the influence of several parameters (e.g. route, dosing frequency) on preventing diabetes onset at normoglycemic and dysglycemic stages. First, encoded peptides should be secreted for effective disease prevention. Furthermore, short weekly treatments with Endotope and proinsulin DNA vaccines delay disease onset, but sustained treatments are required for long-term protection, which was more significant with intradermal delivery. Although epitopes can be presented for at least two weeks, reducing the frequency of antigen administration from weekly to every other week reduced efficacy. Finally, both Endotope and proinsulin DNA vaccines were effective in the dysglycemic stage of disease, but proinsulin provided better protection, particularly in subjects with slower progression of disease. Thus, our data support the possibility of applying a precision medicine approach based on tailored epitopes for the treatment of tissue-specific autoimmune diseases with DNA vaccines.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAntigen-specific immunotherapy is a targeted approach to treat autoimmune diseases by turning off responses to disease-relevant antigens only, leaving the rest of the immune system unaffected. Protein antigens contain many epitopes, but only a fraction of them can be presented on a specific HLA haplotype and the relative importance of different antigens vary between patients due to disease heterogeneity. Strategies based on specific epitopes do not only consider the HLA haplotype and immune profile of groups of patients but can also include important neoepitopes not present in protein antigens. Here, we provide proof-of-principle that such strategy applied to tolerogenic DNA vaccination is effective in a preclinical model of autoimmune diabetes, paving the way for precision medicine using endogenously encoded epitopes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In probabilistic and nonstationary environments, individuals must use internal and external cues to flexibly make decisions that lead to desirable outcomes. To gain insight into the process by which animals choose between actions, we trained mice in a task with time-varying reward probabilities. In our implementation of such a \"two-armed bandit\" task, thirsty mice use information about recent action and action-outcome histories to choose between two ports that deliver water probabilistically. Here, we comprehensively modeled choice behavior in this task, including the trial-to-trial changes in port selection - i.e. action switching behavior. We find that mouse behavior is, at times, deterministic and, at others, apparently stochastic. The behavior deviates from that of a theoretically optimal agent performing Bayesian inference in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We formulate a set of models based on logistic regression, reinforcement learning, and  sticky Bayesian inference that we demonstrate are mathematically equivalent and that accurately describe mouse behavior. The switching behavior of mice in the task is captured in each model by a stochastic action policy, a history-dependent representation of action value, and a tendency to repeat actions despite incoming evidence. The models parsimoniously capture behavior across different environmental conditionals by varying the  stickiness parameter, and, like the mice, they achieve nearly maximal reward rates. These results indicate that mouse behavior reaches near-maximal performance with reduced action switching and can be described by a set of equivalent models with a small number of relatively fixed parameters.\n\nSignificanceTo obtain rewards in changing and uncertain environments, animals must adapt their behavior. We found that mouse choice and trial-to-trial switching behavior in a dynamic and probabilistic two-choice task could be modeled by equivalent theoretical, algorithmic, and descriptive models. These models capture components of evidence accumulation, choice history bias, and stochasticity in mouse behavior. Furthermore, they reveal that mice adapt their behavior in different environmental contexts by modulating their level of  stickiness to their previous choice. Despite deviating from the behavior of a theoretically ideal observer, the empirical models achieve comparable levels of near-maximal reward. These results make predictions to guide interrogation of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision-making strategies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The RNA binding protein RIG-I is a key initiator of the antiviral innate immune response. The signaling that mediates the antiviral response downstream of RIG-I is transduced through the adaptor protein MAVS and results in the induction of type I and III interferons (IFN). This signal transduction occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial contact sites, to which RIG-I and other signaling proteins are recruited following their activation. RIG-I signaling is highly regulated to prevent aberrant activation of this pathway and dysregulated induction of IFN. Previously, we identified UFL1, the E3 ligase of the ubiquitin-like modifier conjugation system called ufmylation, UFL1, as one of the proteins recruited to membranes at ER-mitochondrial contact sites in response to RIG-I activation. Here, we show that UFL1, as well as the process of ufmylation, promote IFN induction in response to RIG-I activation. We find that following RNA virus infection, UFL1 is recruited to the membrane targeting protein 14-3-3{varepsilon}, and that this complex is then recruited to activated RIG-I to promote downstream innate immune signaling. Importantly, we found that 14-3-3{varepsilon} has an increase in UFM1-conjugation following RIG-I activation. Additionally, loss of cellular ufmylation prevents the interaction of 14-3-3{varepsilon} with RIG-I, which abrogates the interaction of RIG-I with MAVS and thus downstream signal transduction that induces IFN. Our results define ufmylation as an integral regulatory component of the RIG-I signaling pathway and as a post-translational control for IFN induction.\n\nSignificanceThe viral RNA sensor RIG-I initiates the antiviral innate immune response by activating a signaling cascade that induces interferon. Activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway is highly regulated to quickly mount a protective immune response while preventing dysregulation that can lead to excessive inflammation or autoimmune disorders. Here, we characterize one such mechanism of regulation. We describe that UFL1, an E3 ligase for the ubiquitin-like modifier conjugation system called ufmylation, is important to promote RIG-I signaling. Using molecular approaches, we show that ufmylation promotes RIG-I interaction with the membrane targeting protein 14-3-3{varepsilon}. As such, ufmylation positively regulates RIG-I recruitment to its signaling adaptor proteins MAVS for induction of interferon in response to RNA virus infection.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cells can sense and respond to mechanical forces in fibrous extracellular matrices (ECM) over distances much greater than their size. This phenomenon, termed long-range force transmission, is enabled by the realignment (buckling) of collagen fibers along directions where the forces are tensile (compressive). However, whether other key structural components of the ECM, in particular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), can affect the efficiency of cellular force transmission remains unclear. Here we developed a theoretical model of force transmission in collagen networks with interpenetrating GAGs, capturing the competition between tension-driven collagen-fiber alignment and the swelling pressure induced by GAGs. Using this model, we show that the swelling pressure provided by GAGs increases the stiffness of the collagen network by stretching the fibers in an isotropic manner. We found that the GAG-induced swelling pressure can help collagen fibers resist buckling as the cells exert contractile forces. This mechanism impedes the alignment of collagen fibers and decreases long-range cellular mechanical communication. We experimentally validated the theoretical predictions by comparing collagen fiber alignment between cellular spheroids cultured on collagen gels versus collagen-GAG co-gels. We found significantly less alignment of collagen in collagen-GAG co-gels, consistent with the prediction that GAGs can prevent collagen fiber alignment. The roles of GAGs in modulating force transmission uncovered in this work can be extended to understand pathological processes such as the formation of fibrotic scars and cancer metastasis, where cells communicate in the presence of abnormally high concentrations of GAGs.\n\nStatement of significanceGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are carbohydrates that are expressed ubiquitously in the human body and are among the key macromolecules that influence development, homeostasis, and pathology of native tissues. Abnormal accumulation of GAGs has been observed in metabolic disorders, solid tumors, and fibrotic tissues. Here we theoretically and experimentally show that tissue swelling caused by the highly polar nature of GAGs significantly affects the mechanical interactions between resident cells by altering the organization and alignment of the collagenous extracellular matrix. The roles of GAGs in modulating cellular force transmission revealed here can guide the design of biomaterial scaffolds in regenerative medicine and provides insights on the role of cell-cell communication in tumor progression and fibrosis.",

Mutations in several human P4-ATPase genes are associated with severe diseases, e.g. in ATP8B1 causing progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, a rare inherited disorder progressing toward liver failure. ATP8B1 forms a binary complex with CDC50A and displays a broad specificity to glycerophospholipids, but regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report functional studies and the cryo-EM structure of the human lipid flippase ATP8B1-CDC50A at 3.1 [A] resolution. We find that ATP8B1 is autoinhibited by its N- and C-terminal tails, which form extensive interactions with the catalytic sites and flexible domain interfaces. Consistently, ATP hydrolysis is unleashed by truncation of the C-terminus, but also requires phosphoinositides, most markedly phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), and removal of both N- and C- termini results in full activation. Restored inhibition of ATP8B1 truncation constructs with a synthetic peptide mimicking the C-terminal segment further suggests molecular communication between N- and C-termini in the autoinhibition and demonstrates that the regulatory mechanism can be interfered with by exogenous compounds. A recurring (G/A)(Y/F)AFS motif of the C-terminal segment suggests that this mechanism is employed widely across P4-ATPase lipid flippases in plasma membrane and endomembranes.",

Here we show that a parameter central to both the physics and the physiology of the cell, its volume, depends on a mechano-osmotic coupling. We found that cells change their volume depending on the rate at which they change shape, when they spread, migrate or are externally deformed. Cells undergo slow deformation at constant volume, while fast deformation leads to volume loss. We propose a mechano-sensitive pump and leak model to explain this phenomenon. Our model and experiments suggest that volume modulation depends on the state of the actin cortex and the coupling of ion fluxes to membrane tension. This mechano-osmotic coupling defines a membrane tension homeostasis module constantly at work in cells, causing volume fluctuations associated with fast cell shape changes, with potential consequences on cellular physiology.",

They primarily propagate via asexual reproduction under normal and healthy environmental conditions. Environmental stimuli that signal a shift to disadvantageous conditions induce D. magna to change their mode of reproduction from asexual to sexual reproduction. During the sexual reproduction phase, they produce special tough eggs (resting eggs), which can survive severe environmental conditions. Despite our increased understanding of their mating behaviours, the sex-specific characteristics of swimming behaviours among daphnid species are poorly understood. In this study, we analysed the swimming patterns and dynamics of female and male adult D. magna. First, we found laterally biased diffusion of males in contrast to the homogeneous, nondirectional diffusion of females. Second, computer modelling analysis using a discrete-time Markov chain simulation, in which the frequencies of turning behaviour were evaluated as probability distributions, explained the greater diffusion of males in the horizontal direction. Under the presumption that high diffusion in the horizontal direction increases the probability of encountering a distant mate, these findings led us to hypothesise that male D. magna increase genotype heterogeneity by effectively selecting the probability distributions of certain motion parameters.\n\nSummary statementsWe analysed the swimming behaviours of adult water flea Daphnia magna, and found apparent sexual differences: laterally biased diffusion of males in contrast to the nondirectional diffusion of females.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Animal models of human cancers are an important tool for the development and preclinical evaluation of therapeutics. Canine B-cell lymphoma (cBCL) is an appealing model for human mature B-cell neoplasms due to the high sequence similarity in cancer genes to humans and inactive telomerase in adult tissues. We performed targeted sequencing on 86 canine patients from the Canine Comparative Oncology Genomic Consortium, with 61 confirmed as B-cell lymphomas. We confirmed a high frequency of mutations in TRAF3 (45%) and FBXW7 (20%) as has been reported by our group and others. We also note a higher frequency of DDX3X (20%) and MYC (13%) mutations in our canine cohort.\n\nWe compared the pattern and incidence of mutations in cBCL to human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hDLBCL) and human Burkitt lymphoma (hBL). Canine MYC mutations displayed a focal pattern with 80% of mutations affecting the conserved phosphodegron sequence in MYC box 1, which are known to stabilize MYC protein. We also note that MYC and FBXW7 mutations do not co-occur in our cBCL cohort, leading to the hypothesis that these mutations represent alternative approaches to stabilize MYC in canine lymphoma.\n\nWe observed striking differences in the pattern of DDX3X mutations in canine lymphoma as compared to hBL and uncovered a sex-specific pattern of DDX3X mutations in hBL that is not consistent with those identified in canine lymphomas.\n\nIn sum, we describe key differences between cBCL and human mature B-cell lymphomas which may indicate differences in the biology of these cancers. This should be considered in future studies of cBCL as a model of human lymphomas.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Calpains are a family of calcium-activated proteases involved in numerous disorders. Notably, previous studies have shown that calpain activity was substantially increased in various models for inherited retinal degeneration (RD). In the present study, we tested the capacity of the t-BOC-Leu-Met-CMAC calpain-specific substrate to detect calpain activity in living retina, in organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type mice, as well as from rd1 and RhoP23H/+ RD-mutant mice. Test conditions were refined until the calpain substrate readily detected large numbers of cells in the photoreceptor layer of RD retina but not in wild-type retina. At the same time, the calpain substrate was not obviously toxic to photoreceptor cells. Comparison of calpain activity with an immunostaining for activated calpain-2 furthermore suggested that individual calpain isoforms may be active in distinct temporal stages of photoreceptor cell death. Notably, calpain-2 activity may be a relatively short-lived event, occurring only towards the end of the cell death process. Finally, our results support the development of calpain activity detection as a novel in vivo biomarker for RD, suitable for combination with non-invasive imaging techniques.",

    "preprint_abstract": "This study examined whether pupil size and response time would distinguish directed exploration from random exploration and exploitation. Eighty-nine participants performed the two-choice probabilistic learning task while their pupil size and response time were continuously recorded. Using LMM analysis, we estimated differences in the pupil size and response time between the advantageous and disadvantageous choices as a function of learning success, i.e., whether or not a participant has learned the probabilistic contingency between choices and their outcomes. We proposed that before a true value of each choice became known to a decision-maker, both advantageous and disadvantageous choices represented a random exploration of the two options with an equally uncertain outcome, whereas the same choices after learning manifested exploitation and direct exploration strategies, respectively. We found that disadvantageous choices were associated with increases both in response time and pupil size, but only after the participants had learned the choice-reward contingencies. For the pupil size, this effect was strongly amplified for those disadvantageous choices that immediately followed gains as compared to losses in the preceding choice. Pupil size modulations were evident during the behavioral choice rather than during the pretrial baseline. These findings suggest that occasional disadvantageous choices, which violate the acquired internal utility model, represent directed exploration. This exploratory strategy shifts choice priorities in favor of information seeking and its autonomic and behavioral concomitants are mainly driven by the conflict between the behavioral plan of the intended exploratory choice and its strong alternative, which has already proven to be more rewarding.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Linear plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA that have been found in a small number of bacterial species. To date, the only linear plasmids described in the Enterobacteriaceae family belong to Salmonella, first found in Salmonella Typhi. Here, we describe a collection of 12 isolates of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex in which we identified linear plasmids. We used this collection to search public sequence databases and discovered an additional 74 linear plasmid sequences in a variety of Enterobacteriaceae species. Gene content analysis divided these plasmids into five distinct phylogroups, with very few genes shared across more than two phylogroups. The majority of linear plasmid-encoded genes are of unknown function, however each phylogroup carried its own unique toxin-antitoxin system and genes with homology to those encoding the ParAB plasmid stability system. Passage in vitro of the 12 linear plasmid-carrying Klebsiella isolates in our collection (which include representatives of all five phylogroups) indicated that these linear plasmids can be stably maintained, and our data suggest they can transmit between K. pneumoniae strains (including members of globally disseminated multidrug resistant clones) and also between diverse Enterobacteriaceae species. The linear plasmid sequences, and representative isolates harbouring them, are made available as a resource to facilitate future studies on the evolution and function of these novel plasmids.\n\nSignificance as a BioResource to the communityThis study provides the first report of linear plasmids identified within the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex and the first report in Enterobacteriaceae besides Salmonella.We present the first comparative analysis of linear plasmid sequences in Enterobacteriaceae, however whilst this family is highly clinically significant, the functional and/or evolutionary importance of these plasmids is not yet clear.

This report presents the results of the manual curation of twenty-seven genes likely associated with circadian rhythm in the genome of Diaphorina citri, the Asian citrus psyllid. This insect acts as the vector of the bacterial pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the causal agent of citrus greening disease (Huanglongbing). This disease is the most severe detriment to citrus industries and has drastically decreased crop yields worldwide. Based on the genes identified in the psyllid genome, namely cry1 and cry2, D. citri likely possesses a circadian model similar to that of the lepidopteran butterfly, Danaus plexippus. Manual annotation of these genes will allow future molecular therapeutics to be developed that can disrupt the psyllid biology.",

Young children are at a particularly high risk, with an estimated half a million deaths worldwide in those under five attributable to invasive pneumococcal disease each year. The cytolytic toxin pneumolysin (Ply) is a primary virulence factor for this bacterium, yet despite its key role in pathogenesis, immune evasion, and transmission, the regulation of Ply production is not well defined. Using a genome-wide association approach we identified a large number of potential affectors of Ply activity, including a gene acquired horizontally on the antibiotic resistance conferring Integrative and Conjugative Element (ICE) ICESp23FST81. This gene encodes a novel modular protein, ZomB, which has an N-terminal UvrD-like helicase domain followed by two Cas4-like domains with potent ATP-dependent nuclease activity. We found the regulatory effect of ZomB to be specific for the ply operon, potentially mediated by its high affinity for the BOX repeats encoded therein. Using a murine model of pneumococcal colonisation, we further demonstrate that a ZomB mutant strain colonises both the upper respiratory tract and lungs at higher levels when compared to the wild type strain. While the antibiotic resistance conferring aspects of ICESp23FST81 is often credited with contributing to the success of the S. pneumoniae lineages that acquire it, its ability to control the expression of a major virulence factor implicated in bacterial transmission is also likely to have played an important role.",

    "preprint_abstract": "A proliferated and post-translationally modified microtubule network underlies cellular growth in cardiac hypertrophy and contributes to contractile dysfunction in heart failure. Yet how the heart achieves this modified network is poorly understood. Determining how the \"tubulin code\" - the permutations of tubulin isoforms and post-translational modifications - is rewritten upon cardiac stress may provide new targets to modulate cardiac remodeling. Further, while tubulin can autoregulate its own expression, it is unknown if autoregulation is operant in the heart or tuned in response to stress. Here we use heart failure patient samples and murine models of cardiac remodeling to interrogate transcriptional, autoregulatory, and post-translational mechanisms that contribute to microtubule network remodeling at different stages of heart disease. We find that autoregulation is operant across tubulin isoforms in the heart and leads to an apparent disconnect in tubulin mRNA and protein levels in heart failure. We also find that within 4 hours of a hypertrophic stimulus and prior to cardiac growth, microtubule detyrosination is rapidly induced to help stabilize the network. This occurs concomitant with rapid transcriptional and autoregulatory activation of specific tubulin isoforms and microtubule motors. Upon continued hypertrophic stimulation, there is an increase in post-translationally modified microtubule tracks and anterograde motors to support cardiac growth, while total tubulin content increases through progressive transcriptional and autoregulatory induction of tubulin isoforms. Our work provides a new model for how the tubulin code is rapidly rewritten to establish a proliferated, stable microtubule network that drives cardiac remodeling, and provides the first evidence of tunable tubulin autoregulation during pathological progression.",

Therefore, there is a high demand for vaccines with enhanced efficacy, high thermostability, superior design flexibility, and fast manufacturing speed. Here, we report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that encodes the trimeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Without the need of nucleotide modification, 5-capping or 3-polyadenylation, circRNA could be rapidly produced via in vitro transcription and is highly thermostable whether stored in naked or lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated format. LNP-encapsulated circRNARBD elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, providing robust protection against Beta (B.1.351) and native viruses in mice and rhesus macaques, respectively. Notably, circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than 1m{Psi}-modified mRNA vaccine, eliciting a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and stronger Th1-biased immune responses. Importantly, we found that circRNARBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against only Omicron but not Delta variant. By contrast, circRNARBD-Delta could elicit high level of neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron. Following two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, circRNARBD-Delta, but not Omicron or Beta vaccines, could effectively boost the neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron variants. These results suggest that circRNARBD-Delta is a favorable choice for vaccination to provide a broad-spectrum protection against the current variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2.",

Before copulation, the germinal epithelium gradually surrounds the oocytes and develops to individually follicles with a stalk-like structure hanging on the ovigerous lamella, which ensures each follicle have access to spermatozoa after copulation. From stage V to early gestation, the cyp17-I highly expressed accompanied by cyp19a1a signals disappearance, and 11-ketotestosterone level keeps rising and peaks at blastula stage, while 17{beta}-estradiol declines to the bottom. Meanwhile, the theca cells rapidly proliferate and invade outwards forming a highly hypertrophied and folded microvillous placenta. This unbalance of hormone might be an important factor driving the theca cells proliferation and invasion. Additionally, some conserved genes related to mammalian placentation are significantly high expression in follicular placenta suggesting the high convergence in vertebrate placenta evolution.",

Using mouse models, we also find that tumor monocyte-to-macrophage progression is profoundly tied to regulatory T cell (Treg) abundance. Importantly, in human kidney cancer, heterogeneity in macrophage accumulation and myeloid composition corresponded to variance in, not only Treg density, but also the quality of infiltrating CD8+ T cells.

Using a 30-year experiment on desert rodents, we show that the impact of species loss on community-level energy use has changed repeatedly and dramatically over time, due to 1) the addition of new species to the community, and 2) a reduction in functional redundancy among the same set of species. Although strong compensation, initially driven by the dispersal of functionally redundant species to the local community, occurred in this system from 1997-2010, since 2010, compensation has broken down due to decreasing functional overlap within the same set of species. Simultaneously, long-term changes in sitewide community composition due to niche complementarity have decoupled the dynamics of compensation from the overall impact of species loss on community-level energy use. Shifting, context-dependent compensatory dynamics, such as those demonstrated here, highlight the importance of explicitly long-term, metacommunity, and eco-evolutionary perspectives on the link between species-level fluctuations and community function in a changing world.",

We examined in an unbiased manner features of the intergenic region of pairs of tandem and closely spaced (<2kb) genes found on the same strand. Intergenic regions separating tandem genes are enriched with Guanines and are characterized by binding of several proteins, including AGO1 and AGO2 of the RNA interference pathway. Additionally, we found that Pol2 with a specific modification pattern is particularly enriched in this region, and it is lost upon perturbations affecting splicing or transcriptional elongation. Perturbations of genes involved in Pol2 pausing and R loop biology preferentially affect expression of downstream genes in tandem gene pairs. Overall, we find that features associated with potential Pol2 recycling rather than those associated with avoidance of transcriptional interference are the predominant driving force shaping these regions.",

Although the reigning hypothesis is that all tetrapods develop limbs in a similar manner, recent work suggests that urodeles have evolved a derived mode of limb development (3-5). Here we demonstrate through pharmacological and genetic inactivation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in axolotls that Shh directs expansion and survival of limb progenitor cells in addition to patterning the limb across the proximodistal and antero-posterior axis. In contrast to inactivation of Shh in mouse or chick embryos where a humerus, radius and single digit develop (6-9), Shh crispant axolotls completely lack forelimbs. In rescuing limb development by implanting SHH-N protein beads into the nascent limb field of Shh-crispants, we show that the limb field is specified in the absence of Shh and that hedgehog pathway activation is required to initiate proximodistal outgrowth. When the derived nature of salamander limb development is placed in a phylogenetic context, it generates a new hypothesis where the ability to regenerate an entire tetrapod limb may have evolved uniquely among urodeles.\n\nTeaserShh is essential for salamander limb development",

    "preprint_abstract": "When metastasizing, tumor cells must traverse environments with diverse physicochemical properties. Recently, the cell nucleus has emerged as a major regulator of the transition from mesenchymal to fast amoeboid (leader bleb-based) migration. Here, in melanoma cells, we demonstrate that increasing nuclear stiffness through elevating Lamin A, inhibits fast amoeboid migration. Importantly, nuclei may respond to force through stiffening. A key factor in this process is the inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein, emerin. Accordingly, we determined the role of emerin in regulating fast amoeboid migration. Strikingly, we found that both the up- and down-regulation of emerin results in an inhibition of fast amoeboid migration. However, when key Src phosphorylation sites were removed, up-regulation of emerin no longer inhibited fast amoeboid migration. Interestingly, in confined cells, Src activity was low, as measured by a Src biosensor. Thus, the fast amoeboid migration of melanoma cells depends on the precise calibration of emerin activity.\n\nSummary StatementIn mechanically constrictive microenvironments, amoeboid migrating melanoma cells require emerin for the precise calibration of nuclear stiffness.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Centrosomes consist of two centrioles and surrounding pericentriolar material (PCM). PCM expands during mitosis in a process called centrosome maturation, in which PCM scaffold proteins play pivotal roles to recruit other centrosomal proteins. In C. elegans, the scaffold protein SPD-5 forms PCM scaffold in a PLK-1 phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, how phosphorylation of SPD-5 promotes PCM scaffold assembly is unclear. Here, we identified three functional domains of SPD-5 through in vivo domain analyses, and propose that sequential domain interactions of SPD-5 are required for mitotic PCM scaffold assembly. Firstly, SPD-5 is targeted to centrioles through direct interaction between its centriole localization (CL) domain and a centriolar protein PCMD-1. Then, intra- and inter-molecular interaction between SPD-5 phospho-regulated multimerization (PReM) domain and the PReM association (PA) domain is triggered by phosphorylation by PLK-1, which leads to PCM scaffold expansion. Our findings suggest that the sequential domain interactions of scaffold proteins mediated by Polo/PLK-1 phosphorylation is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of PCM scaffold assembly.",

To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we mapped genome-wide localization of endogenous mH2A1.1 in the human breast cancer cell MDA-MB 231. We demonstrate that mH2A1.1 specifically binds to active promoters and enhancers in addition to facultative heterochromatin. Selective knock-down of mH2A1.1 deregulates expression of hundreds of highly active genes. Depending on the chromatin landscape, mH2A1.1 acts through two distinct molecular mechanisms. The first is to limit excessive transcription in a predefined environment and relies on domain recruitment of mH2A1.1 at the promoter and gene body. The second mechanism is specific to RNA Pol II (Pol II) paused genes. It requires recruitment of mH2A1.1 restricted to the TSS of these genes. Moreover, we show that these processes occur in a predefined local 3D genome organization and are largely independent of enhancer-promoter looping. Among the genes activated by mH2A1.1, genes regulating mammary tumor cell migration are mostly dependent on Pol II release for their expression level, unlike other categories of mH2A1.1-regulated genes. We thus identified an intriguing new mode of transcriptional regulation by mH2A1.1 and propose that mH2A1.1 serves as a transcriptional modulator with a potential role in assisting the conversion of promoter-locked RNA polymerase II into a productive and elongated Pol II.",

We present a rapid, robust, sensitive and versatile RT-LAMP based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay. Our forty-minute procedure bypasses a dedicated RNA isolation step, is insensitive to carry-over contamination, and uses a hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB)-based colorimetric readout, which allows robust SARS-CoV-2 detection from various sample types. Based on this assay, we have substantially increased sensitivity and scalability by a simple nucleic acid enrichment step (bead-LAMP), established a pipette-free version for home testing (HomeDip-LAMP), and developed open source enzymes that can be produced in any molecular biology setting. Our advanced, universally applicable RT-LAMP assay is a major step towards population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.",

However, the yield or quality of the isolated DNA is often compromised, and commercial kits are used to overcome this to some extent. We developed a new protocol (IARCp) to improve better quality and yield of DNA from FFPE tissues without using any commercial kit. To evaluate the IARCps performance, we compared the quality and yield of DNA with two commercial kits, namely NucleoSpin(R) DNA FFPE XS (MN) and QIAamp DNA Micro (QG) isolation kit. Total DNA yield for QG ranged from 120.0 - 282.0 ng (mean 216.5 ng), for MN: 213.6 - 394.2 ng (mean 319.1 ng), and with IARCp the yield was much higher ranging from 775.5 - 1896.9 ng (mean 1517.8 ng). Moreover, IARCp has also performed well in qualitative assessments. Overall, IARCp represents a novel approach to DNA isolation from FFPE which results in good quality and significant amounts of DNA suitable for many downstream genome-wide and targeted molecular analyses. Our proposed protocol does not require the use of any commercial kits for isolating DNA from FFPE tissues, making it suitable to implement in low-resource settings such as low and middle-income countries (LMICs).",

Yet, despite its pivotal importance in evolution, little is known about the actual prevalence and distribution of hybridization across the tree of life. Here we develop and implement a new statistical method enabling the detection of F1 hybrids from single-individual genome sequencing data. Using simulations and sequencing data from known hybrid systems, we first demonstrate the specificity of the method, and identify its statistical limits. Next, we showcase the method by applying it to available sequencing data from more than 1500 species of Arthropods, including Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Archnida. Among these taxa, we find Hymenoptera, and especially ants, to display the highest number of candidate F1 hybrids, suggesting higher rates of recent hybridization in these groups. The prevalence of F1 hybrids was heterogeneously distributed across ants, with taxa including many candidates tending to harbor specific ecological and life history traits. This work shows how large-scale genomic comparative studies of recent hybridization can be implemented, uncovering the determinants of hybridization frequency across whole taxa.",

We show that larvae degrade the mucus layers to access epithelial cells. In early syncytial tunnels, larvae are completely intracellular but woven through multiple live enterocytes and goblet cells. We also use single cell RNA sequencing for the first time to describe the mouse caecum. From infected caeca, the transcriptome data reveal the progression of infection results in cell damage and an expansion of enterocytes with a type-I interferon (IFN) signature, characterised by the expression of Isg15, instigating the host immune response to the whipworm and tissue repair.

Deciphering the spatial context of spots in a tissue needs to use their spatial information carefully. To this end, we developed a graph attention auto-encoder framework STAGATE to accurately identify spatial domains by learning low-dimensional latent embeddings via integrating spatial information and gene expression profiles. To better characterize the spatial similarity at the boundary of spatial domains, STAGATE adopts an attention mechanism to adaptively learn the similarity of neighboring spots, and an optional cell type-aware module through integrating the pre-clustering of gene expressions. We validated STAGATE on diverse spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by different platforms with different spatial resolutions. STAGATE could substantially improve the identification accuracy of spatial domains, and denoise the data while preserving spatial expression patterns. Importantly, STAGATE could be extended to multiple consecutive sections to reduce batch effects between sections and extracting three-dimensional (3D) expression domains from the reconstructed 3D tissue effectively.",

However, once mTORC1 is activated, it is unclear whether mTORC1 phosphorylates local lysosomal proteins to regulate specific aspects of lysosomal biology. Through cross-reference analyses of lysosome proteomic with mTORC1-regulated phosphoproteomic, we identified STK11IP as a novel lysosome-specific substrate of mTORC1. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates STK11IP at S404. Knockout of STK11IP led to a robust increase of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy flux. Dephosphorylation of STK11IP at S404 represses the role of STK11IP as an autophagy inhibitor. Mechanistically, STK11IP binds to V-ATPase, and regulates the activity of V-ATPase. Knockout of STK11IP protects mice from fasting and Methionine and Choline-Deficient Diet (MCD) diet induced fatty liver. Thus, our study demonstrates that STK11IP phosphorylation represents a novel mechanism for mTORC1 to regulate lysosomal acidification, and points to STK11IP as a promising therapeutic target for the amelioration of diseases with aberrant autophagy signaling.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hundreds of genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have indicated that some phenotypes caused by decreased developmental function of select risk genes can be reversed by restoring gene function in adulthood. However, very few risk genes have been assessed for adult reversibility. We developed a strategy to rapidly assess the temporal requirements and phenotypic reversibility of neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene orthologs using a conditional protein degradation system and machine vision phenotypic profiling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using this approach, we measured the effects of degrading and re- expressing orthologs of 3 neurodevelopmental risk genes EBF3, BRN3A, and DYNC1H1 across 30 morphological, locomotor, sensory, and learning phenotypes at multiple timepoints throughout development. We found some degree of phenotypic reversibility was possible for each gene studied. However, the temporal requirements of gene function and degree of phenotypic reversibility varied by gene and phenotype. The data reflects the dynamic nature of gene function and the importance of using multiple time windows of degradation and re-expression to understand the many roles a gene can play over developmental time. This work also demonstrates a strategy of using a high-throughput model system to investigate temporal requirements of gene function across a large number of phenotypes to rapidly prioritize neurodevelopmental disorder genes for re-expression studies in other organisms.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe developed a strategy that combines a conditional and reversible protein degradation system with our high-throughput machine vision tracking system to assess the temporal windows of gene function and reversibility of phenotypic disruptions associated with neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene orthologs using C. elegans. Using this approach, we assessed 3 genes (unc- 3, unc-86, and dhc-1) and found that post-embryonic rescue was possible for each gene and each phenotypic feature class assessed. Re-activation of certain genes was able to reverse multiple phenotypic disruptions late into development without inducing novel phenotypes, prioritizing them for further study.",

The convergence of machine learning (ML) and available multi-modal data is key moving forward. We build upon previous work to deliver multi-modal predictions of Parkinsons Disease (PD).\n\nMethodsWe performed automated ML on multi-modal data from the Parkinsons Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). After selecting the best performing algorithm, all PPMI data was used to tune the selected model. The model was validated in the Parkinsons Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) dataset. Finally, networks were built to identify gene communities specific to PD.\n\nFindingsOur initial model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 89.72% for the diagnosis of PD. The tuned model was then tested for validation on external data (PDBP, AUC 85.03%). Optimizing thresholds for classification, increased the diagnosis prediction accuracy (balanced accuracy) and other metrics. Combining data modalities outperforms the single biomarker paradigm. UPSIT was the largest contributing predictor for the classification of PD. The transcriptomic data was used to construct a network of disease-relevant transcripts.\n\nInterpretationWe have built a model using an automated ML pipeline to make improved multi-omic predictions of PD. The model developed improves disease risk prediction, a critical step for better assessment of PD risk. We constructed gene expression networks for the next generation of genomics-derived interventions. Our automated ML approach allows complex predictive models to be reproducible and accessible to the community.\n\nFundingNational Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Global Parkinsons Genetics Program.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrior research into predictors of Parkinsons disease (PD) has either used basic statistical methods to make predictions across data modalities, or they have focused on a single data type or biomarker model. We have done this using an open-source automated machine learning (ML) framework on extensive multi-modal data, which we believe yields robust and reproducible results. We consider this the first true multi-modality ML study of PD risk classification.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used a variety of linear, non-linear, kernel, neural networks, and ensemble ML algorithms to generate an accurate classification of both cases and controls in independent datasets using data that is not involved in PD diagnosis itself at study recruitment. The model built in this paper significantly improves upon our previous models that used the entire training dataset in previous work1. Building on this earlier work, we showed that the PD diagnosis can be refined using improved algorithmic classification tools that may yield potential biological insights. We have taken careful consideration to develop and validate this model using public controlled-access datasets and an open-source ML framework to allow for reproducible and transparent results.\n\nImplications of all available evidenceTraining, validating, and tuning a diagnostic algorithm for PD will allow us to augment clinical diagnoses or risk assessments with less need for complex and expensive exams. Going forward, these models can be built on remote or asynchronously collected data which may be important in a growing telemedicine paradigm. More refined diagnostics will also increase clinical trial efficiency by potentially refining phenotyping and predicting onset, allowing providers to identify potential cases earlier. Early detection could lead to improved treatment response and higher efficacy. Finally, as part of our workflow, we built new networks representing communities of genes correlated in PD cases in a hypothesis-free manner, showing how new and existing genes may be connected and highlighting therapeutic opportunities.",

This lack of secondary bile acids was associated with a greater disturbance to the gut microbiome with antibiotics in both the WD and LF/LF diet compared to mouse chow.

    "preprint_abstract": "Determining how and how often asexual lineages emerge within sexual species is central to our understanding of sex-asex transitions and the long-term maintenance of sex. Asexuality can arise \"by transmission\" from an existing asexual lineage to a new one, through different types of crosses. The occurrence of these crosses, cryptic sex, variation in ploidy and recombination within asexuals greatly complicates the study of sex-asex transitions, as they preclude the use of standard phylogenetic methods and genetic distance metrics. In this study we show how to overcome these challenges by developing new approaches to investigate the origin of the various asexual lineages of the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica. We use a large sample of asexuals, including all known polyploids, and their sexual relatives. We combine flow cytometry with mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. We develop new genetic distance measures and methods to compare various scenarios describing the origin of the different lineages. We find that all diploid and polyploid A. parthenogenetica likely arose within the last 80,000 years through successive and nested hybridization events that involved backcrosses with different sexual species. All A. parthenogenetica have the same common ancestor and therefore likely carry the same asexuality gene(s) and reproduce by automixis. These findings radically change our view of sex-asex transitions in this group, and show the importance of considering asexuality \"by transmission\" scenarios. The methods developed are applicable to many other asexual taxa.",

Recent electrophysiological and imaging findings in Drosophila melanogaster allow detailed examination of the neural mechanisms supporting the acquisition, forgetting and assimilation of memories. We propose that this data can be explained by the combination of a dopaminergic plasticity rule that supports a variety of synaptic strength change phenomena, and a circuit structure (derived from neuroanatomy) between dopaminergic and output neurons that creates different roles for specific neurons. Computational modelling shows that this circuit allows for rapid memory acquisition, transfer from short-term to long-term, and exploration/exploitation trade-off. The model can reproduce the observed changes in the activity of each of the identified neurons in conditioning paradigms and can be used for flexible behavioural control.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The ability to control transgene expression, both spatially and temporally, is essential for studying model organisms. In Drosophila, spatial control is primarily provided by the GAL4/UAS system, whilst temporal control relies on a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (which inhibits GAL4) and drug-inducible systems. However, these are not ideal. Shifting temperature can impact on many physiological and behavioural traits, and the current drug-inducible systems are either leaky, toxic, incompatible with existing GAL4-driver lines, or do not generate effective levels of expression. Here we describe the Auxin-inducible Gene Expression System (AGES). AGES relies on the auxin-dependent degradation of a ubiquitously expressed GAL80, and therefore, is compatible with existing GAL4-driver lines. Water-soluble auxin is added to fly food at a low, non-lethal, concentration, which induces expression comparable to uninhibited GAL4 expression. The system works in both larvae and adults, providing a stringent, non-lethal, cost-effective, and convenient method for temporally controlling GAL4 activity in Drosophila.",

While sea urchins can survive a wide range of pH, this comes at a high energetic cost, and early life stages are particularly vulnerable. Information on how OA affects transitions between life-history stages is scarce. We evaluated the direct and indirect effects of pH (pHT 8.0, 7.6 and 7.2) on the development and transition between life-history stages of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, from fertilization to early juvenile. Continuous exposure to low pH negatively affected larval mortality and growth. At pH 7.2, formation of the rudiment (the primordial juvenile) was delayed by two days. Larvae raised at pH 8.0 and transferred to 7.2 after competency had mortality rates five to six times lower than those kept at 8.0, indicating that pH also has a direct effect on older, competent larvae. Latent effects were visible on the larvae raised at pH 7.6: they were more successful in settling (45%) and metamorphosing (30%) than larvae raised at 8.0 (17 and 1% respectively). These direct and indirect effects of OA on settlement and metamorphosis have important implications for population survival.",

In this study, I used mutant rice with a T-DNA insertion in the Os04g0606400 ({Delta}-manI) gene to produce recombinant human acid -glucosidase (rhGAA) for enzyme replacement therapy to treat Pompe disease. After characterization of {Delta}-manI mutant rice, the gene encoding rhGAA was introduced into mutant calli by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Integration of the target sequence into the rice genome was detected by genomic DNA PCR. Expression of rhGAA from {Delta}-manI mutant ({Delta}-manI-GAA) and its secretion into culture media were confirmed by western blot analysis. The N-glycosylation pattern of purified {Delta}-manI-GAA was analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This showed that the high-mannose type N-glycan with man8 (63.8%) was the most abundant form, followed by Man7 (22.5%), GnGnXF3 (6.7%), Man6 (5.4%), and Man5 (1.6%).

These events are part of the inflammatory cascade which involves multiple regulatory steps. Using a murine air-pouch model of inflammation with LPS as an inflammation inducer we demonstrate that isoenzymes of the neuraminidase family (NEU1, 3, and 4) play essential roles in this process acting as positive or negative regulators of leukocyte infiltration. Genetically knocked-out (KO) mice for different NEU genes (Neu1 KO, Neu3 KO, Neu4 KO, and Neu3/4 double KO mice) were induced with LPS, leukocytes at the site of inflammation were counted, and the inflamed tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Our data show that leukocyte recruitment was decreased in NEU1 and NEU3-deficient mice, while it was increased in NEU4-deficient animals. Consistent with these results, systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and those in pouch exudate were reduced in Neu1 and increased in Neu4 KO mice. We found that pharmacological inhibitors specific for NEU1, NEU3, and NEU4 isoforms also affected leukocyte recruitment. We conclude that NEU isoenzymes have distinct - and even opposing - effects on leukocyte recruitment, and therefore warrant further investigation to determine their mechanisms and importance as regulators of the inflammatory cascade.",

We characterize rice OsbZIP47 for vegetative and inflorescence phenotypes in knockdown (OsbZIP47KD) transgenics and uncover its role in meristem maintenance and developmental progression. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) size in five day old OsbZIP47KD seedlings, was reduced as compared to the wild-type (WT). Whereas SAM in older twenty-five-day OsbZIP47KD plants was larger with increased size for L1 and underlying cells. We tested protein interactions of OsbZIP47 with other transcription factors and found partnerships with OsMADS1, RFL, and OSH1. Results from meta-analysis of deregulated panicle transcriptome datasets, in OsbZIP47KD, OsMADS1KD and RFLKD knockdown transgenics, and OSH1 genome-wide binding sites divulge potential targets coregulated by OsbZIP47, OsMADS1, OSH1 and RFL. Transcript analysis in OsbZIP47KD SAM and panicles showed abnormal gene expression for CLAVATA peptide-like signaling FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1), FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER 2 (FON2), and hormone pathway: cytokinin (CK) Isopenteyltransferase2 (OsIPT2), Isopenteyltransferase8 (OsIPT8); auxin biosynthesis OsYUCCA6, OsYUCCA7; gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis GA20Ox1, GA20Ox4 and brassinosteriod biosynthesis CYP734A4 genes. The effects on ABBERANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1), OsMADS16, and DROOPING LEAF relate to second and third whorl organ phenotypes in OsbZIP47KD florets. Further, we demonstrate that OsbZIP47 redox status affects its DNA binding to cis elements in the FCP1 locus. Taken together, we provide insights on unique functional roles for OsbZIP47 in rice shoot meristem maintenance, its progression through inflorescence branching and floret development.\n\nOne sentence summaryOsbZIP47 regulates rice shoot meristem size, panicle and floret development in concert with other meristem regulators such as OsMADS1, RFL and OSH1.",

During repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), RIF1 functions in the 53BP1-Shieldin pathway that inhibits resection of DNA ends to modulate the cellular decision on which repair pathway to engage. Under conditions of replication stress, RIF1 protects nascent DNA at stalled replication forks from degradation by the DNA2 nuclease. How these RIF1 activities are regulated at the post-translational level has not yet been elucidated. Here, we identified a cluster of conserved ATM/ATR consensus SQ motifs within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of mouse RIF1 that are phosphorylated in proliferating B lymphocytes. We found that phosphorylation of the conserved IDR SQ cluster is dispensable for the inhibition of DSB resection by RIF1, but is essential to counteract DNA2-dependent degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks. Therefore, our study identifies a key molecular switch that enables the genome-protective function of RIF1 during DNA replication stress.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Viral antagonism of innate immune pathways is a common mechanism by which viruses evade immune surveillance. Infection of host cells with reovirus leads to the blockade of NF-{kappa}B, a key transcriptional regulator of the hosts innate immune response. One mechanism by which reovirus infection results in inhibition of NF-{kappa}B is through a diminishment in levels of upstream activators, IKK{beta} and NEMO. Here, we demonstrate a second, distinct mechanism by which reovirus blocks NF-{kappa}B. We report that expression of a single viral protein, {sigma}3, is sufficient to inhibit expression of NF-{kappa}B target genes. Further, {sigma}3-mediated blockade of NF-{kappa}B occurs without changes to IKK levels or activity. Expression of only a subset of NF-{kappa}B target genes is reduced. Among NF-{kappa}B targets, the expression of type I interferon is significantly diminished by {sigma}3 expression. Correspondingly, ectopic expression of {sigma}3 enhances viral replication. Expression of NF-{kappa}B target genes varies following infection with closely related reovirus strains. Our genetic analysis identifies that these differences are controlled by polymorphisms in the amino acid sequence of {sigma}3. This work identifies a new role for reovirus {sigma}3 as a viral antagonist of the NF-{kappa}B-dependent antiviral pathways.\n\nIMPORTANCEHost cells mount a response to curb virus replication in infected cells and prevent spread of virus to neighboring, as yet uninfected cells. The NF-{kappa}B family of proteins is important for the cell to mediate this response. In this study, we show that a single protein, {sigma}3, produced by mammalian reovirus, impairs the function of NF-{kappa}B. We demonstrate that by blocking NF-{kappa}B, {sigma}3 diminishes the hosts response to infection and promotes viral replication.

    "preprint_abstract": "The ability of the anaerobic gastrointestinal pathogen, Clostridioides difficile, to survive outside the host relies on the formation of dormant endospores. Spore formation is contingent on the activation of a conserved transcription factor, Spo0A, by phosphorylation. Multiple kinases and phosphatases regulate Spo0A activity in other spore-forming organisms; however, these factors are not well conserved in C. difficile. Previously, we discovered that deletion of a conserved phosphotransfer protein, CD1492, increases sporulation, indicating that CD1492 inhibits C. difficile spore formation. In this study, we investigate the functions of additional conserved orphan phosphotransfer proteins, CD2492, CD1579, and CD1949 which are hypothesized to regulate Spo0A phosphorylation. Disruption of the conserved phosphotransfer protein, CD2492, also increased sporulation frequency, similarly to the CD1492 mutant, and in contrast to a previous study. A CD1492 CD2492 mutant phenocopied the sporulation and gene expression patterns of the single mutants, suggesting that these proteins function in the same genetic pathway to repress sporulation. Deletion of the conserved CD1579 phosphotransfer protein also variably increased sporulation frequency; however, knockdown of CD1949 expression did not influence sporulation. We provide evidence that CD1492, CD2492 and CD1579 function as phosphatases, as mutation of the conserved histidine residue for phosphate transfer abolished CD2492 function, and expression of the CD1492 or CD2492 histidine site-directed mutants or the wild-type CD1579 allele in a parent strain resulted in a dominant negative hypersporulation phenotype. Altogether, at least three phosphotransfer proteins, CD1492, CD2492 and CD1579 (herein, PtpA, PtpB and PtpC) repress C. difficile sporulation initiation by regulating activity of Spo0A.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe formation of inactive spores is critical for the long-term survival of the gastrointestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile. The onset of sporulation is controlled by the master regulator of sporulation, Spo0A, which is activated by phosphorylation. Multiple kinases and phosphatases control Spo0A phosphorylation; however, this regulatory pathway is not defined in C. difficile. We show that two conserved phosphotransfer proteins, CD1492 (PtpA) and CD2492 (PtpB), function in the same regulatory pathway to repress sporulation by preventing Spo0A phosphorylation. We show that another conserved phosphotransfer protein, CD1579 (PtpC), also represses sporulation, and we eliminate the possibility that a fourth orphan histidine kinase protein, CD1949, impacts C. difficile sporulation. These results support the idea that C. difficile inhibits sporulation initiation through multiple phosphatases.",

    "preprint_abstract": "An in-depth understanding of microbial function and the division of ecological niches requires accurate delineation and identification of microbes at a fine taxonomic resolution. Microbial phylotypes are typically defined using a 97% small subunit (16S) rRNA threshold. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of taxonomic units of distinct functions within phylotypes. These so-called sequence-discrete populations (SDPs) have used to be mainly delineated by disjunct sequence similarity at the whole-genome level. However, gene markers that could accurately identify and quantify SDPs are lacking in microbial community studies. Here we developed a pipeline to screen single-copy protein-coding genes that could accurately characterize SDP diversity via amplicon sequencing of microbial communities. Fifteen candidate marker genes were evaluated using three criteria (extent of sequence divergence, phylogenetic accuracy, and conservation of primer regions) and the selected genes were subject to test the efficiency in differentiating SDPs within Gilliamella, a core honeybee gut microbial phylotype, as a proof-of-concept. The results showed that the 16S V4 region failed to report accurate SDP diversities due to low taxonomic resolution and changing copy numbers. In contrast, the single-copy genes recommended by our pipeline were able to successfully quantify Gilliamella SDPs for both mock samples and honeybee guts, with results highly consistent with those of metagenomics. The pipeline developed in this study is expected to identify single-copy protein coding genes capable of accurately quantifying diverse bacterial communities at the SDP level.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial communities can be distinguished by discrete genetic and ecological characteristics. These sequence-discrete populations are foundational for investigating the composition and functional structures of microbial communities at high resolution. In this study, we screened for reliable single-copy protein-coding marker genes to identify sequence-discrete populations through our pipeline. Using marker gene amplicon sequencing, we could accurately and efficiently delineate the population diversity in microbial communities. These results suggest that single copy protein-coding genes can be an accurate, quantitative and economical alternative for characterizing population diversity. Moreover, the feasibility of a gene as marker for any bacterial population identification can be quickly evaluated by the pipeline proposed here.",

P. micra is among the most highly enriched species at numerous sites of mucosal dysbiotic disease and is closely associated with the development of multiple types of malignant tumors. Despite its strong association with disease, surprisingly little is known about P. micra pathobiology, which is directly attributable to its longstanding genetic intractability. To address this problem, we directly isolated a collection of P. micra strains from odontogenic abscess clinical specimens and then screened these isolates for natural competence. Amazingly, all of the P. micra clinical isolates exhibited various levels of natural competence, including the reference strain ATCC 33270. By exploiting this ability, we were able to employ cloning-independent methodologies to engineer and complement a variety of targeted chromosomal genetic mutations directly within low passage clinical isolates. To create the first P. micra genetic system, we employed renilla-based bioluminescence for highly sensitive reporter studies. This reporter system was then applied for the development of the novel Theo+ theophylline-inducible riboswitch for tunable gene expression studies over a broad dynamic range. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of generating Mariner-based Tn-seq libraries for forward genetic screening in P. micra. With the availability of a highly efficient transformation protocol and the current suite of genetic tools, P. micra should now be considered as a fully genetically tractable organism suitable for molecular genetic research. The methods presented here provide a clear path to investigate the understudied role of P. micra in polymicrobial infections and tumorigenesis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Interspecific hybridization may trigger the transition from sexual reproduction to asexuality, but mechanistic reasons for such a change in a hybrids reproduction are poorly understood. Gametogenesis of many asexual hybrids involves a stage of premeiotic endoreduplication (PMER), when gonial cells duplicate chromosomes and subsequent meiotic divisions involve bivalents between identical copies, leading to production of clonal gametes. Here, we investigated the triggers of PMER and whether its induction is linked to intrinsic stimuli within a hybrids gonial cells or whether it is regulated by the surrounding gonadal tissue.\n\nWe investigated gametogenesis in the Cobitis taenia hybrid complex, which involves sexually reproducing species (Cobitis elongatoides and C. taenia) as well as their hybrids, where females reproduce clonally via PMER while males are sterile. We transplanted spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) from C. elongatoides and triploid hybrid males into embryos of sexual species and of asexual hybrid females, respectively, and observed their development in an allospecific gonadal environment. Sexual SSCs underwent regular meiosis and produced normally reduced gametes when transplanted into clonal females. On the other hand, the hybrids SSCs lead to sterility when transplanted into sexual males, but maintained their ability to undergo asexual development (PMER) and production of clonal eggs, when transplanted into sexual females.\n\nThis suggests that asexual gametogenesis is under complex control when somatic gonadal tissue indirectly affects the execution of asexual development by determining the sexual differentiation of stem cells and once such cells develop to female phenotypes, hybrid germ cells trigger the PMER from their intrinsic signals.\n\nSignificance StatementAlthough sexual reproduction is a dominant trait among all eukaryotes, many taxa have evolved the ability to reproduce asexually. While asexuality appears to be linked to interspecific hybridization, it remains unknown how the coexistence of diverged genomes may initiate such a swap in reproduction. In our study, we transplanted germ cells between asexual hybrids and their parents. On one hand, the ability of clonal gametogenesis occurred exclusively in hybrid germ cells, suggesting that asexual development is directly triggered by the hybrid genomic constitution of the cell. On the other hand, clonality was observed only in cells transplanted into females, suggesting that the execution of clonal development is influenced by signals from the gonadal environment and regulated by somatic factors.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Fostering a balanced gut microbiome through the administration of beneficial microbes that can competitively exclude pathogens has gained a lot of attention and use in human and animal medicine. However, little is known about how microbes affect the horizontal gene transfer of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To shed more light on this question, we challenged neonatal broiler chicks raised on reused broiler chicken litter - a complex environment made up of decomposing pine shavings, feces, uric acid, feathers, and feed, with Salmonella Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg), a model pathogen. Neonatal chicks challenged with S. Heidelberg and raised on reused litter were more resistant to S. Heidelberg cecal colonization than chicks grown on fresh litter. Furthermore, chicks grown on reused litter were at a lower risk of colonization with S. Heidelberg strains that encoded AMR on IncI1 plasmids. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to show that the major difference between chicks grown on fresh litter and reused litter was the microbiome harbored in the litter and ceca. The microbiome of reused litter samples was more uniform and enriched in functional pathways related to the biosynthesis of organic and antimicrobial molecules than fresh litter samples. We found that E. coli was the main reservoir of plasmids encoding AMR and that the IncI1 plasmid was maintained at a significantly lower copy per cell in reused litter compared to fresh litter. These findings support the notion that commensal bacteria play an integral role in the horizontal transfer of plasmids encoding AMR to pathogens like Salmonella.\n\nImportance/SignificanceAntimicrobial resistance spread is a worldwide health challenge, stemming in large part, from the ability of microorganisms to share their genetic material through horizontal gene transfer. To address this issue, many countries and international organization have adopted a One health approach to curtail the proliferation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. This includes the removal and reduction of antibiotics used in food animal production and the development of alternatives to antibiotics. However, there is still a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of how resistance spreads in the absence of antibiotic selection and the role commensal bacteria play in reducing antibiotic resistance transfer. In this study, we show that commensal bacteria play a key role in reducing the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance to Salmonella and provide the identity of the bacterial species that potentially perform this function in broiler chickens and also postulate the mechanism involved.",

A body of quantitative comparisons between theory and experiment have since questioned the initial paradigm that the sharp hb transcription pattern emerges solely from diffusive biochemical interactions between the Bicoid transcription factor and the gene promoter region. Several alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as additional sources of positional information, positive feedback from Hb proteins or out-of-equilibrium transcription activation.\n\nBy using the MS2-MCP RNA-tagging system and analysing in real time, the transcription dynamics of synthetic reporters for Bicoid and/or its two partners Zelda and Hunchback, we show that all the hb expression pattern features and temporal dynamics are compatible with an equilibrium model with a short decay length Bicoid activity gradient as a sole source of positional information. Meanwhile, Bicoids partners speed-up the process by different means: Zelda lowers the Bicoid concentration threshold required for transcriptional activation while Hunchback reduces burstiness and increases the polymerase firing rate.",

We isolated 10 E. coli strains and sequenced the genomes of two of them. Phylogenetically the two isolates were closer to strains isolated from poultry meat than with freshwater E. coli, albeit their genomes were smaller than those from poultry. After isolation and fluorescent protein tagging of strains ED1 and ED157 we show that Daphnia sp. can take up these strains and release them alive again, thus forming a temporary host for E. coli. In a chemostat experiment we show that the association does not prolong the bacterial long-term survival, but that at low abundances it does also not significantly reduce the bacterial numbers. We demonstrate that E. coli does not belong to the core microbiota of Daphnia, suffers from competition by the natural microbiota of Daphnia, but can profit from its carapax to survive in water. All in all, this study suggests that the association of E. coli to Daphnia is only temporary but that the cells are viable therein and this might allow encounters with other bacteria for genetic exchange and potential genomic adaptations to the freshwater environment.\n\nImportanceThe contamination of freshwaters with faecal derived bacteria is of major concern regarding drinking water acquisition and recreational activities. Ecological interactions promoting their persistence are still very scarcely studied. This study, which analyses the survival of E. coli in the presence of zooplankton, is thus of ecological as well as water safety relevance.",

Such species sometimes hybridise in nature, which raises the question how can they coexist. This also holds for the Tanganyika mouthbrooders Ophthalmotilapia ventralis and O. nasuta. Earlier studies found indications of asymmetrical hybridisation with females of O. ventralis accepting males of O. nasuta, but not the other way around. We hypothesised that this was due to differences in the capacity for species recognition. Given the higher propensity of O. ventralis females towards hybridisation, we expect a reduced ability for species recognition in O. ventralis females, compared to O. nasuta females. We staged two experiments, one focusing on 22 female O. nasuta and one on 21 female O. ventralis. These fish were placed in one half of a tank and briefly exposed to a conspecific or a heterospecific male, a conspecific female, or nothing (control). Female response was evaluated by scoring six tracking parameters and by noting the occurrence of ten discrete behaviours before and during the encounter. Females always responded to the presence of another fish by approaching it. Remarkably, for both O. nasuta and O. ventralis, we did not find a different response between encounters with conspecific males and females. However, in agreement with our hypothesis, O. nasuta females behaved differently towards conspecific or heterospecific males, whereas O. ventralis females did not. When presented with a heterospecific male, O. nasuta females performed a lower number of  ram behaviours. Additionally, they never displayed the  flee behaviour, a component of the species mating repertoire that was seen in all but one of the presentations with a conspecific male. Our findings show that differences in species recognition at first encounter predict to a large degree the outcome of the mating process, even in the absence of mating behaviour.",

By fusing Dam to single-chain variable fragment antibodies, engineered chromatin reader domains, or endogenous chromatin-binding proteins, we render the DamID technology and all its implementations compatible with the genome-wide identification of histone post-translational modifications. Importantly, this enables the joint analysis of chromatin marks and transcriptome in a variety of biological systems at the single-cell level. In this study, we use EpiDamID to profile single-cell Polycomb occupancy in mouse embryoid bodies and provide evidence for hierarchical gene regulatory networks. We further demonstrate the applicability of this method to in vivo systems by mapping H3K9me3 in early zebrafish embryogenesis, and detect striking heterochromatic regions specifically in the notochord.

However, it remains unclear whether single-brain studies are informative about cooperation in real life, where people interact dynamically. Such dynamic interactions have become the focus of inter-brain studies. An advantageous technique in this regard is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) because it is less susceptible to movement artifacts than more conventional techniques like EEG or fMRI. We conducted a systematic review and the first quantitative meta-analysis of fNIRS hyperscanning of cooperation, based on thirteen studies with 890 participants. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed evidence of statistically significant inter-brain synchrony while people were cooperating, with large overall effect sizes in both frontal and temporoparietal areas. All thirteen studies observed significant inter-brain synchrony in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that this region is particularly relevant for cooperative behavior. The consistency in these findings is unlikely to be due to task-related activations, given that the relevant studies used diverse cooperation tasks. Together, the present findings support the importance of inter-brain synchronization of frontal and temporoparietal regions in interpersonal cooperation. Moreover, the present article highlights the usefulness of meta-analyses as a tool for discerning patterns in inter-brain dynamics.",

Here, we validate a computational framework for modelling electrical potentials, ionic movement, and cellular swelling in brain tissue during CSD. We consider different model variations representing wild type or knock-out/knock-down mice and systematically compare the numerical results with reports from a selection of experimental studies. We find that the data for several CSD hallmarks obtained computationally, including wave propagation speed, direct current shift duration, peak in extracellular K+ concentration as well as a pronounced shrinkage of extracellular space, are well in line with what has previously been observed experimentally. Further, we assess how key model parameters including cellular diffusivity, structural ratios, membrane water and/or K+ permeabilities affect the set of CSD characteristics.\n\nSignificance StatementMovement of ions and molecules in and between cellular compartments is fundamental for brain function. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is associated with dramatic failure of brain ion homeostasis. Better understanding the sequence of events in CSD could thus provide new insight into physiological processes in the brain. Despite extensive experimental research over the last decades, even basic questions related to mechanisms underlying CSD remain unanswered. Computational modelling can play an important role going forward, since simulation studies can address hypotheses that are difficult to target experimentally.

We hypothesize that genes that interact with core cancer gene (CCG) in a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) may have functional importance.\n\nMethodsWe categorized genes into 1- (n=6791), 2- (n=7724), 3- (n=1587), and >3-steps (n=362) removed from the nearest CCG in the STRING PPI and demonstrate that the cancer-biology related functional contribution of the genes in these different neighborhood categories decreases as their distance from the CCGs increases.\n\nResultsGenes closer to cancer genes manifest greater connectedness in the network, show greater importance in maintaining cell viability in a broad range of cancer cells in vitro, are also under greater negative germline selection pressure in the healthy populations, and have higher somatic mutation frequency and cancer effect.\n\nConclusionsApproximately 70% of human genes are 1 or 2 steps removed from cancer genes in protein network and show functional importance in cancer-biology. These results suggest that the universe of cancer-relevant genes extends to thousands of genes that can contribute functional effects when dysregulated.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The marble burying test is a commonly used paradigm to screen phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The current methodological approach relies solely on reporting the number of buried marbles at the end of the test. By measuring the proxy of the behavior (buried marbles), rather than the behavior itself (burying bouts), many important characteristics regarding the temporal aspect of this assay are lost. Here we introduce a novel, automated method to quantify mouse behavior throughout the duration of the marble burying test with the focus on the burying bouts. Using open-source software packages, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm (the \"classifier\") to distinguish burying behavior in freely moving mice. In order to confirm the classifiers accuracy and uncover the behavioral meaning of the marble burying test, we performed marble burying test in three mouse models: Ube3am-/p+ (Angelman Syndrome model), Shank2-/- (autism model), and Sapap3-/- (obsessive-compulsive disorder model) mice. The classifier scored burying behavior accurately and consistent with the literature in the Ube3am-/p+ mice, which showed decreased levels of burying compared to controls. Shank2-/- mice showed a similar pattern of decreased burying behavior, which was not found in Sapap3-/- mice. Tracking mouse behavior throughout the test enabled us to quantify activity characteristics, revealing hypoactivity in Ube3am-/p+ and hyperactivity in the Shank2-/- mice, indicating that mouse activity is unrelated to burying behavior. Together, we demonstrate that our classifier is an accurate method for the analysis of the marble burying test, providing more information than the currently used methods.\n\nSignificance StatementThe marble burying test is widely used in phenotyping neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorder mouse models. Currently, its analysis consists of manually scoring the number of buried marbles upon the completion of the assay. This approach is not standardized across laboratories, and leaves out important variables such as movement characteristics and information about the burying bouts. This leads to divergent interpretations of the marble burying test, ranging from anxiety to cognitive impairment. We introduce a method that reliably tracks mouse behavior throughout the experiment, classifies the duration and number of the burying bouts, and is generalizable across laboratories. Using machine learning for measuring the actual burying behavior standardizes this method, and provides rich information about the burying characteristics.",

Immune cell trafficking into tumors is mediated by chemokines, which are expressed and secreted upon various stimuli and interact with specific receptors. To broadly characterize chemokine expression and function in tumors, we have used multiplex mass cytometry-based imaging of protein markers and RNA transcripts to analyze the chemokine landscape and immune infiltration in metastatic melanoma samples. Tumors that lacked immune infiltration were devoid of most chemokines and exhibited particularly low levels of antigen presentation and inflammation. Infiltrated tumors were characterized by expression of multiple chemokines. CXCL9 and CXCL10 were often localized in patches associated with dysfunctional T cells expressing CXCL13 which was strongly associated with B cell patches and follicles. TCF7+ naive-like T cells, which predict response to immunotherapy, were enriched in the vicinity of B cell patches and follicles. Our data highlight the strength of RNA and protein co-detection which was critical to deconvolve specialized immune microenvironments in inflamed tumors based on chemokine expression. Our findings further suggest that the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures is accompanied by naive and naive- like T cell recruitment, which ultimately boosts anti-tumor activity.\n\nOne sentence summaryInflammatory chemokine milieus in metastatic melanoma are hotspots of T cell dysfunction and CXCL13 expression, which likely guide the recruitment of B cells and the formation of B cell follicles responsible for anti-tumor immunity.",

At the endosome and lysosomes, ubiquitination of membrane proteins triggers ESCRT-mediated substrate recognition and degradation. Using the yeast lysosome/vacuole, we define the principles by which substrate engagement by ESCRTs occurs at this organelle. We find that multivalent interactions between ESCRT-0 and polyubiquitin is critical for substrate recognition at yeast vacuoles, with a lower-valency requirement for cargo engagement at endosomes. Direct recruitment of ESCRT-0 induces dynamic foci on the vacuole membrane, and forms fluid condensates in vitro with polyubiquitin. We propose that self-assembly of early ESCRTs induces condensation, an initial step in ESCRT-assembly/nucleation at membranes. This property can be tuned specifically at various organelles by modulating the number of binding interactions.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCondensation of multivalent ESCRT-0/polyubiquitin assemblies organizes cargo sorting reactions at lysosomes",

    "preprint_abstract": "Aspirin intake has been shown to lead to significant protection against colorectal cancer, e.g. with an up to two-fold reduction in colorectal adenoma incidence rates at higher doses. The mechanisms contributing to protection are not yet fully understood. While aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug and can thus influence the tumor microenvironment, in vitro and in vivo experiments have recently shown that aspirin can also have a direct effect on cellular kinetics and fitness. It reduces the rate of tumor cell division and increases the rate of cell death. The question arises whether such changes in cellular fitness are sufficient to significantly contribute to the epidemiologically observed protection. To investigate this, we constructed a class of mathematical models of in vivo evolution of advanced adenomas, parameterized it with available estimates, and calculated population level incidence. Fitting the predictions to age incidence data revealed that only a model that included colonic crypt competition can account for the observed age-incidence curve. This model was then used to predict modified incidence patterns if cellular kinetics were altered as a result of aspirin treatment. We found that changes in cellular fitness that were within the experimentally observed ranges could reduce advanced adenoma incidence by a sufficient amount to account for age incidence data in aspirin-treated patient cohorts. While the mechanisms that contribute to the protective effect of aspirin are likely complex and multi-factorial, our study demonstrates that direct aspirin-induced changes of tumor cell fitness can significantly contribute to epidemiologically observed reduced incidence patterns.",

However, current experimental approaches have not yet produced whole-brain maps of a comprehensive set of neuronal and nonneuronal types that approaches the cellular diversity of the mammalian cortex. Here we aim to fill in this gap in knowledge with an open-source computational pipeline, Matrix Inversion with Subset Selection (MISS), that can infer quantitatively validated distributions of diverse collections of neural cell types at 200m resolution using a combination of single-cell RNAseq and in situ hybridization datasets. We rigorously demonstrate the accuracy of MISS against literature expectations. Importantly, we show that gene subset selection, a procedure by which we filter out low-information genes prior to performing deconvolution, is a critical pre-processing step that distinguishes MISS from its predecessors and facilitates the production of cell type maps with significantly higher accuracy. We also show that MISS is generalizable by generating high-quality cell type maps from a second, independently curated single-cell RNAseq dataset. Together, our results illustrate the viability of computational approaches for determining the spatial distributions of a wide variety of cell types from genetic data alone.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In wild populations, large individuals have disproportionately higher reproductive output than smaller individuals. Some theoretical models explain this pattern - termed reproductive hyperallometry - by individuals allocating a greater fraction of available energy towards reproductive effort as they grow. Here, we propose an ecological explanation for this observation: differences between individuals in rates of resource assimilation, where greater assimilation causes both increased reproduction and body size, resulting in reproductive hyperallometry at the level of the population. We illustrate this effect by determining the relationship between size and reproduction in wild and lab-reared Trinidadian guppies. We show that (i) reproduction increased disproportionately with body size in the wild but not in the lab, where resource competition was eliminated and food availability restricted; (ii) in the wild, hyperallometry was greatest during the wet season, when resource competition is strongest; and (iii) detection of hyperallometric scaling of reproduction at the population level was inevitable if individual differences in assimilation were ignored. We propose that ecologically-driven variation in assimilation - caused by size-dependent resource competition, niche expansion, and chance - contributes substantially to hyperallometric scaling of reproduction in natural populations. We recommend that mechanistic models incorporate such ecologically-caused variation when seeking to explain reproductive hyperallometry.",

Ligands could be classified into equivalence groups based on their profile of positive and negative synergies with other ligands. These groups varied with receptor expression, explaining how ligands can functionally replace each other in one context but not another.

To identify clinically relevant circRNAs with potential for wound diagnosis and therapy, an in-depth characterization of circRNA expression in human healing and non-healing wounds is a prerequisite that has not been attained yet.\n\nMethodsWe collected wound-edge biopsies through the healing process of healthy donors and in chronic non-healing venous ulcers (VU). Paired total RNA- and small RNA-sequencing were performed to profile circRNAs, protein-coding mRNAs, and microRNA expression. We analyzed the co-expression relationship between circRNAs and mRNAs with weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and constructed circRNA-microRNA-mRNA networks. For the circRNAs surfaced in the in-silico analysis, after validating their expression with RT-PCR and sequencing, we silenced hsa-CHST15_0003 and hsa-TNFRSF21_0001 expression in keratinocytes with siRNAs and studied their function with transcriptomic profiling and live-cell monitoring.\n\nResultsOur study unravels the dynamically changed expression patterns of circRNAs during human skin wound healing and their abnormal expression signature in VU, which are presented as a searchable web resource (http://130.229.28.87/shiny/circRNA_wholebiopsy-shinyApp/). In silico analysis deciphers the circRNA-miRNAs-mRNA networks specific to the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound repair and VU, the biological processes that circRNAs are involved, and the circRNAs that could act as miRNAs sponge in human wounds. Importantly, we found that hsa-CHST15_0003 and hsa-TNFRSF21_0001, two circRNAs upregulated in VU, hampered keratinocyte migration while promoting proliferation through modulating gene networks underpinning these cellular processes.\n\nConclusionBy integrating circRNA, mRNA, and miRNA expression profiles in a unique collection of clinical samples, we identify the circRNAs that are relevant to human wound healing physiology and pathology.

Cells undergoing transformation have to adjust to changes, such as metabolic requirements. This is achieved, in part, by modulating the protein abundance of transcription factors, which manifest these adjustments. Here, we report that the deubiquitylase USP28 enables oncogenic reprogramming by regulating the protein abundance of proto-oncogenes, such as c-JUN, c-MYC, NOTCH and {Delta}NP63, at early stages of malignant transformation. USP28 is increased in cancer compared to normal cells due to a feed-forward loop, driven by increased amounts of oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-MYC and c-JUN. Irrespective of oncogenic driver, interference with USP28 abundance or activity suppresses growth and survival of transformed lung cells. Furthermore, inhibition of USP28 via a small molecule inhibitor reset the proteome of transformed cells towards a  pre-malignant state, and its inhibition cooperated with clinically established compounds used to target EGFRL858R, BRAFV600E or PI3KH1047R driven tumor cells. Targeting USP28 protein abundance already at an early stage via inhibition of its activity therefore is a feasible strategy for the treatment of early stage lung tumours and the observed synergism with current standard of care inhibitors holds the potential for improved targeting of established tumors.",

Throughout eukaryotes, 2-O-methylation of residues 32 and 34 of the anticodon loop of tRNA is important for proper translation, and in humans, lack of these modifications results in non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. In yeast, the methyltransferase Trm7 forms a complex with Trm732 to 2-O-methylate tRNA residue 32 and with Trm734 to 2-O-methylate tRNA residue 34. Trm732 and Trm734 are required for the methylation activity of Trm7, but the role of these auxiliary proteins is not clear. Additionally, Trm732 and Trm734 homologs are implicated in biological processes not directly related to translation, suggesting that these proteins may have additional cellular functions. To identify critical amino acids in Trm732, we generated variants and tested their ability to function in yeast cells. We identified a conserved RRSAGLP motif in the conserved DUF2428 domain of Trm732 that is required for tRNA modification activity by both yeast Trm732 and its human homolog THADA. The identification of Trm732 variants that lack tRNA modification activity will help to determine if other biological functions ascribed to Trm732 and THADA are directly due to tRNA modification, or to secondary effects due to other functions of these proteins.",

However, these invasive recordings are spatially sparse since they depend on clinical needs. This sparsity hampers systematic comparisons across-subjects, the detection of the whole-brain spatiotemporal properties of CCEPs, as well as their relationships with classic sensory evoked potentials.\n\nObjectiveTo demonstrate that CCEPs recorded by high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) are sensitive to changes in stimulation parameters and compensate for the limitations typical of invasive recordings.\n\nMethodsSEEG and hd-EEG activities were simultaneously recorded during SPES in drug-resistant epileptic patients (N=36). Changes in stimulation parameters encompassed physical (pulse intensity and width), geometrical (angle and position with respect to white/grey matter) and topological (stimulated cortical area) properties. Differences were assessed by measuring the overall responses and the amplitude of N1 and N2 components of the CCEPs, and by their spectral profiles.\n\nResultsWhile invasive and non-invasive CCEPs were generally correlated, differences in pulse duration, angle and stimulated cortical area were better captured by hd-EEG. Further, hd-EEG responses to SPES reproduced basic features of responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation and showed a much larger amplitude as compared to typical sensory evoked potentials.\n\nConclusionsThe present results show that macroscale hd-EEG recordings are exquisitely sensitive to variations in SPES parameters, including local changes in physical and geometrical stimulus properties, while providing valuable information about whole-brain dynamics.

    "preprint_abstract": "Hippocampal somatostatin (SOM) cells are dendrite-projecting inhibitory interneurons. CA1 SOM cells receive major excitatory inputs from pyramidal cells (PC-SOM synapses) which show mGluR1a- and mTORC1-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP). PC-SOM synapse LTP contributes to CA1 network metaplasticity and memory consolidation, but whether it is sufficient to regulate these processes remains unknown. Here we used optogenetic stimulation of CA1 pyramidal cells and whole cell recordings in slices to show that optogenetic theta burst stimulation (TBSopto) produces LTP at PC-SOM synapses. At the network level, we found that TBSopto differentially regulates metaplasticity of pyramidal cell inputs: enhancing LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses and depressing LTP at temporo-ammonic synapses. At the behavioral level, we uncovered that in vivo TBSopto regulates learning-induced LTP at PC-SOM synapses, as well as contextual fear memory. Thus, LTP of PC-SOM synapses is a long-term feedback mechanism controlling pyramidal cell synaptic plasticity, sufficient to regulate memory consolidation.",

We report that 22% of the high grade OvCa tumors at diagnosis express CIP2A oncoprotein at low levels. CIP2Alow OvCa tumors have significantly lower likelihood of disease relapse after standard chemotherapy, but yet a portion of relapsed tumors retain their CIP2Alow phenotype. We further discover that reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducing compound APR-246 (PRIMA-1Met/Eprenetapopt), currently in clinical development, preferentially kill CIP2Alow OvCa cells across multiple chemotherapy resistant cell lines. Consistent with CIP2Alow OvCa subtype in humans, CIP2A is dispensable for development of MISIIR-TAg-driven mouse OvCa tumors. Nevertheless, CIP2A deficient OvCa tumor cells from MISIIR-TAg mice displayed APR-246 hypersensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the lack of CIP2A expression hypersensitizes the OvCa cells to APR-246 by inhibition of NF-kB activity. Accordingly, combination of APR-246 and Nf-kB inhibitor compounds strongly synergized in killing of CIP2A positive OvCa cells. Collectively, we discover low CIP2A expression as a vulnerability for APR-246 in OvCa. The results warrant consideration of clinical testing of APR-246 for CIP2Alow OvCa tumor subtype patients, and reveal CIP2A as a candidate APR-246 combination therapy target.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Recent research has pointed to alpha brain oscillations as a potential clinical biomarker for sensitivity to pain. In particular, researchers claimed that the slowing of individual alpha frequency (IAF) could be an objective marker of pain during prolonged nociceptive stimulation. However, prolonged pain has been also associated with increased IAF. To date, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that IAF can be a neural marker of pain.\\n\\nThe current study aimed at elucidating the conflicting findings by assessing the specificity of the relationship between brain alpha oscillations and tonic pain. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) on healthy volunteers during exposure to consecutive 5-minute sessions of painful hot water immersion, innocuous warm water immersion and an aversive, non-painful auditory stimulus, matched by unpleasantness to the painful condition. Participants rated stimulus unpleasantness throughout each condition. We also asked participants to sit still with eyes closed and eyes open right before and after the three experimental conditions in order to obtain a robust estimate of baseline alpha. Our findings revealed both increased and decreased IAF during tonic hot stimulation depending on the alpha range targeted (7-13 Hz vs. 8-10 Hz). In addition, they provide mild evidence for a negative relationship between IAF and the unpleasantness of the experience. Finally, we could not identify a difference between IAF during tonic hot temperature and during tonic auditory experience. Altogether, these findings emphasize a twofold frequency pattern (increase vs. decrease) for IAF during tonic thermal pain, thus indicating the need for robust methodological scrutiny of IAF as a neural marker of pain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The study of brain network interactions during naturalistic stimuli facilitates a deeper understanding of human brain function. Intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is a widely used method that can measure neural responses to naturalistic stimuli that are consistent across subjects. However, interdependent correlation values in ISC artificially inflated the degrees of freedom, which hinders the investigation of individual differences. Besides, the existing ISC model mainly focus on similarities between subjects but fails to distinguish neural responses to different stimuli features. To estimate large-scale brain networks evoked with naturalistic stimuli, we propose a novel analytic framework to characterize shared spatio-temporal patterns across subjects in a purely data-driven manner. In the framework, a third-order tensor is constructed from the timeseries extracted from all brain regions from a given parcellation, for all participants, with modes of the tensor corresponding to spatial distribution, time series and participants. Tensor component analysis (TCA) will then reveal spatially and temporally shared components, i.e., naturalistic stimuli evoked networks, their temporal courses of activity and subject loadings of each component. To enhance the reproducibility of the estimation with TCA, a novel spectral clustering method, tensor spectral clustering, was proposed and applied to evaluate the stability of TCA algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via simulations and real fMRI data collected during a motor task with a traditional fMRI study design. We also apply the proposed framework to fMRI data collected during passive movie watching to illustrate how reproducible brain networks are identified evoked by naturalistic movie viewing.",

Prior studies have reported a predominantly horizontal direction for healthy subjects in a 7 Tesla (T) MR scanner, with slow phase velocity (SPV) dependent on head orientation. Less is known about vestibular signal behavior for subjects in a weaker, 3T magnetic field, the standard strength used in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The purpose of this study is to characterize the form and magnitude of nystagmus induced at 3T.\n\nMethodsForty-two subjects were studied after being introduced head-first, supine into a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. Eye movements were recorded in four separate acquisitions over 20 minutes. A biometric eye model was fit to the recordings to derive rotational eye position and then SPV. An anatomical template of the semi-circular canals was fit to the T2 anatomical image from each subject, and used to derive the angle of the B0 magnetic field with respect to the vestibular apparatus.\n\nResultsRecordings from 37 subjects yielded valid measures of eye movements. The population-mean SPV {+/-} SD for the horizontal component was -1.38 {+/-} 1.27 deg/sec, and vertical component was -0.93 {+/-} 1.44 deg/sec, corresponding to drift movement in the rightward and downward direction. Although there was substantial inter-subject variability, persistent nystagmus was present in half of subjects with no significant adaptation over the 20 minute scanning period. The amplitude of vertical drift was correlated with the roll angle of the vestibular system, with a non-zero vertical SPV present at a 0 degree roll.\n\nInterpretationNon-habituating vestibular signals of varying amplitude are present in resting state data collected at 3T.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cortical processing of binocular disparity is believed to begin in V1 where cells are sensitive to absolute disparity, followed by the extraction of relative disparity in higher visual areas. While much is known about the cortical distribution and spatial tuning of disparity-selective neurons, the relationship between their spatial and temporal properties is less well understood. Here, we use steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials and dynamic random dot stereograms to characterize the temporal dynamics of spatial mechanisms in human visual cortex that are primarily sensitive to either absolute or relative disparity. Stereograms alternated between disparate and non-disparate states at 2 Hz. By varying the spatial frequency content of the disparate fields from a planar surface to corrugated ones, we biased responses towards absolute vs. relative disparities. Reliable Components Analysis was used to derive two dominant sources from the 128 channel EEG records. The first component (RC1) was maximal over the occipital pole while the second component (RC2) was maximal over right lateral occipital electrodes. In RC1, first harmonic responses were sustained, tuned for corrugation frequency, and sensitive to the presence of disparity references, consistent with prior psychophysical sensitivity measurements. By contrast, the second harmonic, associated with transient processing, was not spatially tuned and was indifferent to references, consistent with it being generated by an absolute disparity mechanism. In RC2, the sustained response component showed similar tuning and sensitivity to references. However, sensitivity for absolute disparity dropped off, and transient signals were mainly driven by the lowest corrugation frequencies.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSustained and transient mechanisms have been demonstrated across sensory systems and may reflect a common coding strategy. This strategy may be useful for the analysis of the form and duration of complex events in the case of sustained signals, and the onset and location of events in the case of transient signals. Here, we provide direct neural correlates of sustained and transient disparity mechanisms in human visual cortex. Early visual cortex is sensitive to both relative and absolute disparity, with the former being processed in a sustained fashion and the latter in a more transient fashion. Outside of early visual cortex, sustained relative disparity responses are readily measurable, but transient responses and responses to absolute disparity are not.",

However, to the best of our knowledge this property of human IgA has previously been described only cursorily. In the present study pooled human serum IgA and two human monoclonal IgA antibodies were exposed to buffers with acidic pH, to free heme or to ferrous ions, and the antigen-binding behavior of the native and modified IgA to viral and bacterial antigens were compared using immunoblot and ELISA. We observed a dose-dependent increase in reactivity to several bacterial extracts and to pure viral antigens.

    "preprint_abstract": "Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling plays critical roles during vertebrate development, including regulation of skeletal and cartilage growth. TH acts through its receptors (TRs), nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) that heterodimerize with Retinoid-X receptors (RXRs), to regulate gene expression. A defining difference between NR signaling during development compared to in adult tissues, is competence, the ability of the organism to respond to an endocrine signal. Amphibian metamorphosis, especially in Xenopus laevis, the African clawed frog, is a well-established in vivo model for studying the mechanisms of TH action during development. Previously, weve used one-week post-fertilization X. laevis tadpoles, which are only partially competent to TH, to show that in the tail, which is naturally refractive to exogenous T3 at this stage, RXR agonists increase TH competence, and that RXR antagonism inhibits the TH response. Here, we focused on the jaw that undergoes dramatic TH-mediated remodeling during metamorphosis in order to support new feeding and breathing styles. We used a battery of approaches in one-week-old tadpoles, including quantitative morphology, differential gene expression and whole mount cell proliferation assays, to show that both pharmacologic (bexarotene) and environmental (tributyltin) RXR agonists potentiated TH-induced responses but were inactive in the absence of TH; and the RXR antagonist UVI 3003 inhibited TH action. At this young age, the lower jaw has not developed to the point that T3-induced changes produce an adult-like jaw morphology, and we found that increasing TH competence with RXR agonists did not give us a more natural-metamorphic phenotype, even though Bex and TBT significantly potentiated cellular proliferation and the TH induction of runx2, a transcription factor critical for developing cartilage and bone. Prominent targets of RXR-mediated TH potentiation were members of the matrix metalloprotease family, suggesting that RXR potentiation may emphasize pathways responsible for rapid changes during development.",

Its study in D. dadantii showed that it secretes a wide range of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, including pectinases and a cellulase. However, the full repertoire of exoproteins it can secrete has probably not yet been identified. Secreted proteins are first addressed to the periplasm before their secretion by Out. No secretion signal present on the protein allows the identification of substrates of a T2SS. To identify new Out substrates, we analyzed D. dadantii transcriptome data obtained in plant infection condition and searched for genes strongly induced encoding a protein with a signal sequence. We identified four new Out-secreted proteins: the expansin YoaJ, the putative virulence factor VirK and two proteins of the DUF 4879 family, SvfA and SvfB. We showed that SvfA and SvfB are required for full virulence of D. dadantii and showed that svf genes are present in a variable number of copies in other Pectobacteriaceae, up to three in D. fanghzongdai. This work opens the way to the study of the role of non-pectinolytic proteins secreted by the Out pathway in Pectobacteriaceae.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe plant pathogen Dickeya rely on a type 2 secretion system named Out for their pathogenicity. Importance of plant cell wall degrading enzymes secreted by this system has been well studied. However, existence and role of other Out-secreted proteins has barely been investigated. By mining D. dadantii transcriptome data, we identified four new Out-secreted proteins. We showed that two of them, SvfA and SvfB, are necessary for the full virulence of the bacteria. These findings show that identification of all the proteins secreted by the Dickeya Out system is necessary for a better knowledge of the virulence of these bacteria.",

The structure and diversity of bacterial species in various ecosystems can be quickly examined using NGS. This approach is considerably quicker and more precise than outdated methods. Healthy or citrus greening infected leaf samples of Grapefruit, Citrus aurantifolia, and Citrus reticulata Blanco was used for diversity analysis. In this study high throughput, NGS technique was used to access the population of both cultivable and non-cultivable bacterial endophytes from citrus leaves, by using PCR amplicons of 16S rDNA sequences (V5-V7 regions) with Illumina Hi seq. As a result, a total number of 68,722 sequences were produced from the test samples. According to the NGS-based diversity classification, the most common genera of exploited bacterial endophytes were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus paradisi showed almost equal diversity, whereas Citrus reticulata Blanco had a higher proportion of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria in their leaves. To determine alpha diversity (AD), additional data was analyzed using statistical indices such as Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson. According to the inverse Simpson diversity index, the abundance of the microbial population in six different citrus samples was 0.48, 0.567, and 0.163, respectively. The metagenomics of microbiota in plant tissues was successfully recorded by NGS technology, which can help us learn more about the interactions between plants and microbes.

In contrast, studies focusing on specific taxa revealed a biodiversity homogenization effect in areas subjected to long-term intensive industrial agriculture. We investigated whether land use affects biodiversity and metacommunity structure in 67 kettle holes (KH) representing small aquatic islands embedded in the patchwork matrix of a largely agricultural landscape comprising grassland, forest, and arable fields. These KH, similar to millions of standing water bodies of glacial origin, spread across northern Europe, Asia, and North America, are physico-chemically diverse, differ in the degree of coupling with their surroundings. We assessed biodiversity patterns of eukaryotes, Bacteria and Archaea in relation to environmental features of the KH, using deep-amplicon-sequencing of eDNA. First, we asked whether deep sequencing of eDNA provides a representative picture of KH biodiversity across the three domains of life. Second, we investigated if and to what extent KH biodiversity is influenced by the surrounding land-use. Our data shows that deep eDNA amplicon sequencing is useful for in-depth assessments of cross-domain biodiversity comprising both micro- and macro-organisms, but, has limitations with respect to single-taxa conservation studies. Using this broad method, we show that sediment eDNA, integrating several years to decades, depicts the history of agricultural land-use intensification. The latter, coupled with landscape wide nutrient enrichment (including by atmospheric deposition), groundwater connectivity between KH and organismal movement in the tight network of ponds, resulted in a biodiversity homogenization in the KH water, levelling off todays detectable differences in KH biodiversity between land-use types.",

This allows the user to design gRNAs targeting all genes in a typical bacterial genome in about 1-2 minutes.\n\nConclusionsGuidemaker enables the rapid design of genome-wide gRNA for any CRISPR-Cas enzyme in non-model organisms. While GuideMaker is designed with prokaryotic genomes in mind, it can efficiently process smaller eukaryotic genomes as well. GuideMaker is available as command-line software, a stand-alone web application, and a tool in the CyCverse Discovery Environment.

Little is known about the human {beta} cell secretome, and recent studies question translatability of rodent {beta} cell secretory profiles. Here, we verify representativeness of EndoC-{beta}H1, one of the most widely used human {beta} cell lines, as a translational human {beta} cell model based on omics and characterize the EndoC-{beta}H1 secretome. We profiled EndoC-{beta}H1 cells using RNA-seq, Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) and Tandem Mass Tag proteomics of cell lysate. Omics profiles of EndoC-{beta}H1 cells were compared to human {beta} cells and insulinomas. Secretome composition was assessed by DIA proteomics. Agreement between EndoC-{beta}H1 cells and primary adult human {beta} cells was ~90% for global omics profiles as well as for {beta} cell markers, transcription factors and enzymes. Discrepancies in expression were due to elevated proliferation rate of EndoC-{beta}H1 cells compared to adult {beta} cells. Consistently, similarity was slightly higher with benign non-metastatic insulinomas. EndoC-{beta}H1 secreted 671 proteins in untreated baseline state and 3,278 proteins when stressed with non-targeting control siRNA, including known {beta} cell hormones INS, IAPP, and IGF2. Further, EndoC-{beta}H1 secreted proteins known to generate bioactive peptides such as granins and enzymes required for production of bioactive peptides. Unexpectedly, exosomes appeared to be a major mode of secretion in EndoC-{beta}H1 cells. We believe that secretion of exosomes and bioactive peptides warrant further investigation with specialized proteomics workflows in future studies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=106 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459582v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1976bc0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@233c4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c3350org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bcf0d5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIWe validate EndoC-{beta}H1 as a translational human {beta} cell model using omics.\nC_LIO_LIWe present the first unbiased proteomics composition of human {beta} cell line secretome.\nC_LIO_LIThe secretome of human {beta} cells is more extensive than previously thought.\nC_LIO_LIUntreated cells secreted 671 proteins and stressed cells secreted 3,278 proteins.\nC_LIO_LISecretion of exosomes and bioactive peptides constitute directions of future research.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundBurkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis. Sequence typing this pathogen can reveal geographical origin and uncover epidemiological associations. Here, we describe B. pseudomallei genes encoding putative penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and investigate their utility for determining phylogeography and differentiating closely related species.\n\nMethodology & Principal FindingsWe performed in silico analysis to characterize 10 PBP homologs in B. pseudomallei 1026b. As PBP active site mutations can confer {beta}-lactam resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, PBP sequences in two resistant B. pseudomallei strains were examined for similar alterations. Sequence alignments revealed single amino acid polymorphisms (SAAPs) unique to the multidrug resistant strain Bp1651 in the transpeptidase domains of two PBPs, but not directly within the active sites. Using BLASTn analyses of complete assembled genomes in the NCBI database, we determined genes encoding PBPs were conserved among B. pseudomallei (n=101) and Burkholderia mallei (n=26) strains. Within these genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) useful for predicting geographic origin of B. pseudomallei were uncovered. SNPs unique to B. mallei were also identified. Based on 11 SNPs identified in two genes encoding predicted PBP-3s, a dual-locus sequence typing (DLST) scheme was developed. The robustness of this typing scheme was assessed using 1,523 RefSeq genomes from B. pseudomallei (n=1,442) and B. mallei (n=81) strains, resulting in 32 sequence types (STs). Compared to multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), the DLST scheme demonstrated less resolution to support the continental separation of Australian B. pseudomallei strains. However, several STs were unique to strains originating from a specific country or region. The phylogeography of Western Hemisphere B. pseudomallei strains was more highly resolved by DLST compared to internal transcribed spacer (ITS) typing, and all B. mallei strains formed a single ST.\n\nSignificanceConserved genes encoding PBPs in B. pseudomallei are useful for strain typing, can enhance predictions of geographic origin, and differentiate strains of closely related Burkholderia species.\n\nAuthor SummaryBurkholderia pseudomallei causes the life-threatening disease melioidosis and is considered a biological threat and select agent by the United States government. This soil-dwelling bacterium is commonly found in regions of southeast Asia and northern Australia, but it is also detected in other tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world. With a predicted global burden of 165,000 annual cases and mortality rate that can exceed 40% without prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment, understanding the epidemiology of melioidosis and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in B. pseudomallei can benefit public health and safety. Recently, we identified ten conserved genes encoding putative penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in B. pseudomallei. Here, we examined B. pseudomallei PBP sequences for amino acid mutations that may contribute to {beta}-lactam resistance. We also uncovered nucleotide mutations with utility to predict the geographical origin of B. pseudomallei strains and to differentiate closely related Burkholderia species. Based on 11 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms in two genes each encoding a PBP-3, we developed a simple, targeted dual-locus typing approach.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones is well-conserved and expressed in all organisms. In budding yeast, cells express four highly similar cytosolic Hsp70s Ssa1, 2, 3 and 4 which arose from gene duplication. Ssa1 and 2 are constitutively expressed while Ssa3 and 4 are induced upon heat shock. Recent evidence suggests that despite their amino acid similarity, these Ssas have unique roles in the cell. Here we examine the relative importance of Ssa1-4 in the regulation of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). We demonstrate that cells expressing either Ssa3 or Ssa4 as their sole Ssa are compromised for their resistance to DNA damaging agents and activation of DDR transcription. In addition, we show that the steady state levels and stability of RNR small subunits Rnr2 and Rnr4 are reduced in Ssa3 or Ssa4-expressing cells, a result of decreased Ssa-RNR interaction. Interaction between the Hsp70 co-chaperone Ydj1 and RNR is correspondingly decreased in cells only expressing Ssa3 and 4. Through studies of Ssa2/4 domain swap chimeras, we determined that the C-terminal domain of Ssas are the source of this functional specificity. Taking together, our work suggests a distinct role for Ssa paralogs in regulating DNA replication mediated by C-terminus sequence variation.\n\nAuthor SummaryCells require molecular chaperones to fold proteins into their active conformation. A major mystery however is why cells express so many highly-related and apparently redundant Hsp70 paralogs. We examined the role of four Hsp70 paralogs in budding yeast (Ssa1, 2, 3 and 4) on the activity of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR complex). Importantly, we demonstrate there is selectivity of RNR subunits for Ssa1 and Ssa2 subunits, which is dictated by the co-chaperone Ydj1. Taken together, our work provides new insight into the functional specificity of Hsp70 paralogs using a native client protein.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that trogocytosis modulates immune responses, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, using two mouse models of leukemia, we found that cytotoxic lymphocytes perform trogocytosis at high rates with tumor cells. While performing trogocytosis, both Natural Killer and CD8+ T cells acquire the checkpoint receptor PD-1 from leukemia cells. In vitro and in vivo investigation revealed that PD-1 protein found on the surface of Natural Killer cells, rather than being endogenously expressed, was derived entirely from leukemia cells. Mechanistically, SLAM receptors were essential for PD-1 trogocytosis. PD-1 acquired via trogocytosis actively suppressed anti-tumor immunity, as revealed by the positive outcome of PD-1 blockade in PD-1-deficient mice. PD-1 trogocytosis was corroborated in patients with clonal plasma cell disorders, where Natural Killer cells that stained for PD-1 also stained for tumor cell markers. Our results, in addition to shedding light on a previously unappreciated mechanism underlying the presence of PD-1 on Natural Killer and cytotoxic T cells, reveal the immune-regulatory effect of membrane transfer occurring when immune cells contact tumor cells.\n\nOnce sentence summaryNatural Killer cells are inhibited by PD-1 acquired from the surface of tumor cells via trogocytosis.",

Salmonella Typhimurium (STm), which causes severe systemic disease in most inbred mice, has been used as a model for disseminated disease. To screen for new infection phenotypes across a range of host genetics, we orally infected 32 Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains with STm and monitored their disease progression for seven days by telemetry. Our data revealed a broad range of phenotypes across CC strains in many parameters including survival, bacterial colonization, tissue damage, complete blood counts (CBC), and serum cytokines. Eighteen CC strains survived to day 7, while fourteen susceptible strains succumbed to infection before day 7. Several CC strains had sex differences in survival and colonization. Surviving strains had lower pre-infection baseline temperatures and were less active during their daily active period. Core body temperature disruptions were detected earlier after STm infection than activity disruptions, making temperature a better detector of illness. All CC strains had STm in spleen and liver, but susceptible strains were more highly colonized. Tissue damage was weakly negatively correlated to survival. We identified loci associated with survival on Chromosomes (Chr) 1, 2, 4, 7. Polymorphisms in Ncf2 and Slc11a1, known to reduce survival in mice after STm infections, are located in the Chr 1 interval, and the Chr 7 association overlaps with a previously identified QTL peak called Ses2. We identified two new genetic regions on Chr 2 and 4 associated with susceptibility to STm infection. Our data reveal the diversity of responses to STm infection across a range of host genetics and identified new candidate regions for survival of STm infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySalmonella Typhimurium (STm) infections typically cause self-limiting diarrheal symptoms, but in some individuals, the bacteria can spread throughout the body and cause life-threatening infection. We used a population of genetically different mice (Collaborative Cross) to identify their range of responses to STm infection. We identified a broad range of outcomes across these different mice, including a group of mice susceptible to lethal infection and a group that survived our 7 day study. We found that mice that survived STm infection had a cooler core body temperature before infection than susceptible mice, while remaining active. Thus, body temperature, rather than activity, appears to be a better predictor of poor outcomes after STm infection. We identified several regions of the mouse genome that are associated with outcome after STm infection. One of these regions, mouse Chromosome (Chr) 1 has genes that are already known to influence susceptibility to STm infection. Two other regions that we identified to influence survival after STm infection, located on mouse Chr 2 and 4, are novel and contain numerous genes of interest that may be linked to susceptibility. Our work defines the utility of exploring how host genetic diversity influences infection outcomes with bacterial pathogens.",

Even though AIV has a broad host range, few studies account for host diversity when estimating AIV spread. We analyzed AIV genomic sequences from North American wild birds, including 303 newly sequenced isolates, to estimate interspecies transmission and geographic diffusion patterns among multiple co-circulating subtypes. Our results show high transition rates within Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, but limited transitions between these orders. Patterns of interspecies transmission were positively associated with breeding habitat range overlap, and negatively associated with host genetic distance. Distance between regions (negative correlation) and summer temperature at origin (positive correlation) were strong predictors of diffusion. Taken together, this study demonstrates that host diversity and ecology can determine evolutionary processes that underlie AIV natural history and spread. Understanding these processes can provide important insights for effective control of AIV.",

Cloacimonadota members were abundant and diverse in metagenomic datasets from a municipal landfill, prompting an examination of phylogenetic relationships, metabolic diversity, and pangenomic dynamics across the phylum, based on 22 publicly available genomes and 24 from landfill samples. Cloacimonadota formed two discrete clades, with one clades genomes principally deriving from engineered systems. A few more-divergent genomes were placed basal in the tree, and not associated with either clade. Metabolic reconstructions for metagenome-assembled genomes predict an anaerobic, acetogenic, and fermentative lifestyle for the majority of Cloacimonadota surveyed. Genomes from engineered ecosystems (first clade) encode a unique suite of genes not typically found in genomes from natural environments (second clade). These encoded functions include acetate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of acetate from acetyl phosphate, and carbon utilization enzymes, suggesting different substrate degradation and energy generation strategies in these ecologically and phylogenetically distinct lineages.\n\nOriginality/Significance StatementCloacimonadota is a bacterial phylum that is under-described compared to its members prevalence in genome repositories. Cloacimonadota are frequently associated with engineered systems, including being identified as abundant and diverse in the municipal landfill site surveyed in this study. We reconstructed twenty-four landfill-associated Cloacimonadota metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), more than doubling the number of publicly available Cloacimonadota genomes. We combined these MAGs with available reference genomes to predict major metabolic pathways and to describe the conserved features in the lifestyle of phylum Cloacimonadota. We found that Cloacimonadota have distinct evolutionary histories associated with engineered versus natural environments. Prior studies have evaluated metabolism from individual Cloacimonadota genomes - this work is the first to examine trait distribution across a more-complete representation of the phylum, including identification of genomic features and metabolic strategies that correlate to habitat of origin.",

Abscission is thus triggered by tension release, but how ICB tension is controlled is unknown. Here, we report that caveolae, which are known to control membrane tension upon mechanical stress in interphase cells, are located at the midbody, at the abscission site and at the ICB/cell interface in dividing cells. Functionally, the loss of caveolae delays ESCRT-III recruitment during cytokinesis and impairs abscission. This is the consequence of a 2-fold increase of ICB tension measured by laser ablation, associated with a local increase in myosin II activity at the ICB/cell interface. We thus propose that caveolae buffer membrane tension and limit contractibility at the ICB to promote ESCRT-III assembly and cytokinetic abscission. Altogether, this work reveals an unexpected connection between caveolae and the ESCRT machinery and the first role of caveolae in cell division.\n\nTEASERCaveolae limit the tension in the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis to enable ESCRT-III assembly and successful abscission.",

We analysed population genomic data and tested for cryptic species in 160 Ae. albopictus sampled from 16 locations across this region. We found no evidence of cryptic Ae. albopictus but found multiple intraspecific COI haplotypes partitioned into groups representing three Asian lineages: East Asia, Southeast Asia and Indonesia. Papua New Guinea (PNG), Vanuatu and Christmas Island shared recent coancestry, and Indonesia and Timor-Leste were likely invaded from East Asia. We used a machine learning trained on morphologically sexed samples to classify sexes using multiple genetic features and then characterized the wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia infections in 664 other samples. The wAlbA and wAlbB infections as detected by qPCR showed markedly different patterns in the sexes. For females, most populations had a very high double infection incidence, with 67% being the lowest value (from Timor-Leste). For males, the incidence of double infections ranged from 100% (PNG) to 0% (Vanuatu). Only 6 females were infected solely by the wAlbA infection, while rare uninfected mosquitoes were found in both sexes. The wAlbA and wAlbB densities varied significantly among populations. For mosquitoes from Torres Strait and Vietnam, the wAlbB density was similar in single-infected and superinfected (wAlbA and wAlbB) mosquitoes. There was a positive association between wAlbA and wAlbB infection densities in superinfected Ae. albopictus. Our findings provide no evidence of cryptic species of Ae. albopictus in the region and suggest site-specific factors influencing the incidence of Wolbachia infections and their densities. We also demonstrate the usefulness of SNPs as sex-specific mosquito markers.

    "preprint_abstract": "The large taxonomic variability of microbial community composition is a consequence of the combination of environmental variability, mediated through ecological interactions, and stochasticity. Most of the analysis aiming to infer the biological factors determining this difference in community structure start by quantifying how much communities are similar in their composition, trough beta-diversity metrics. The central role that these metrics play in microbial ecology does not parallel with a quantitative understanding of their relationships and statistical properties. In particular, we lack a framework that reproduces the empirical statistical properties of beta-diversity metrics. Here we take a macroecological approach and introduce a model to reproduce the statistical properties of community similarity. The model is based on the statistical properties of individual communities and on a single tunable parameter, the correlation of species carrying capacities across communities, which sets the difference of two communities. The model reproduces quantitatively the empirical values of several commonly-used beta-diversity metrics, as well as the relationships between them. In particular, this modeling framework naturally reproduces the negative correlation between overlap and dissimilarity, which has been observed in both empirical and experimental communities and previously related to the existence of universal features of community dynamics. In this framework, such correlation naturally emerges due to the effect of random sampling.\n\nAUTHORS SUMMARYSeveral biological and ecological forces shape the composition of microbial communities. But also contingency and stochasticity play an important role. Comparing communities, identifying which conditions are similar in communities with similar species composition, allows to identify which forces shape their structure. Here we introduce a modeling framework which reproduces the statistical features of community similarity. We identify a single relevant parameter that captures in a single number the multidimensional nature of similarity in community composition. These results set the basis for a quantitative, and predicting, theory of the statistical properties of microbial communities.",

However, cluster analysis is not able to reveal continuous spectrum of states and underlying gene expression programs (GEPs) shared across cell types. We introduce scAAnet, an autoencoder for single-cell non-linear archetypal analysis, to identify GEPs and infer the relative activity of each GEP across cells. We use a count distribution-based loss term to account for the sparsity and overdispersion of the raw count data and add an archetypal constraint to the loss function of scAAnet. We first show that scAAnet outperforms existing methods for archetypal analysis across different metrics through simulations. We then demonstrate the ability of scAAnet to extract biologically meaningful GEPs using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets including a pancreatic islet dataset, a lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis dataset and a prefrontal cortex dataset.",

This vastly expands the range of chemical functionality accessible within proteins produced in these organisms. Despite these clear successes, explorations of PylRS function in yeast remains limited. In this work, we demonstrate that the Methanomethylophilus alvus PylRS (MaPylRS) and its cognate tRNACUA support the incorporation of ncAAs into proteins produced in S. cerevisiae using stop codon suppression methodologies. Additionally, we prepared three MaPylRS mutants originally engineered in E. coli and determined that all three were translationally active with one or more ncAAs, although with low efficiencies of ncAA incorporation in comparison to the parent MaPylRS. Alongside MaPylRS variants, we evaluated the translational activity of previously reported Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina barkeri, and chimeric M. mazei and M. barkeri PylRSs. Using the yeast strain RJY100, and pairing these aaRSs with the M. barkeri tRNACUA, we did not observe any detectable stop codon suppression activity under the same conditions that produced moderately efficient ncAA incorporation with MaPylRS. The addition of MaPylRS to the orthogonal translation machinery toolkit in yeast potentially opens the door to hundreds of ncAAs that have not previously been genetically encodable using other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs. Extending the scope of ncAA incorporation in yeast could powerfully advance chemical and biological research for applications ranging from basic biological discovery to enzyme engineering and therapeutic protein lead discovery.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=164 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475408v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@606cceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@874cadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb2c99org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6cf963_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, creating designs with functions beyond folding is more challenging. In that regard, the recent design of small beta barrel proteins that activate the fluorescence of an exogenous small molecule chromophore (DFHBI) is noteworthy. These proteins, termed mini Fluorescence Activating Proteins (mFAPs), have been shown increase the brightness of the chromophore more than 100-fold upon binding to the designed ligand pocket. The design process created a large library of variants with different brightness levels but gave no rational explanation for why one variant was brighter than another. Here we use quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how molecular flexibility in the ground and excited states influences brightness. We show that the ability of the protein to resist dihedral angle rotation of the chromophore is critical for predicting brightness. Our simulations suggest that the mFAP/DFHBI complex has a rough energy landscape, requiring extensive ground-state sampling to achieve converged predictions of excited-state kinetics. While computationally demanding, this roughness suggests that mFAP protein function can be enhanced by reshaping the energy landscape towards states that better resist DFHBI bond rotation.",

However, MSci models are known to have unidentifiability issues, whereby different models or parameters make the same predictions about the data and cannot be distinguished by the data. Previous studies have focused on heuristic methods based on gene trees, and does not make an efficient use of the information in the data. Here we study the unidentifiability of MSci models under the full likelihood methods. We characterize the unidentifiability of the bidirectional introgression (BDI) model, which assumes that gene flow occurs in both directions. We derive simple rules for arbitrary BDI models, which create unidentifiability of the label-switching type. In general, an MSci model with k BDI events has 2k unidentifiable modes or towers in the posterior, with each BDI event between sister species creating within-model parameter unidentifiability and each BDI event between non-sister species creating between-model unidentifiability. We develop novel algorithms for processing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples to remove label-switching problems and implement them in the BPP program. We analyze real and synthetic data to illustrate the utility of the BDI models and the new algorithms. We discuss the unidentifiability of heuristic methods and provide guidelines for the use of MSci models to infer gene flow using genomic data.",

Approximately 22-30 kya there is evidence for a reduction in Ne to approximately 60 000 individuals. These events are likely due to changes in environmental conditions, such as sea level and oceanic currents, especially around the last glacial maximum (19-33 kya).\nC_LIO_LIThe results of this study suggest that Japanese eel has experienced at least two population bottlenecks, interspersed by a period of population growth. This pattern of demographic history may make Japanese eel sensitive to current and future population declines.

We complement this result with parameterized complexity lower-bounds for stronger variants (e.g., NP-hardness when tw' or tw - tw' is constant). We propose a prototype implementation for our approach which we apply on difficult instances of selected RNA-based problems: RNA design, sequence-structure alignment, and search of pseudoknotted RNAs in genomes, revealing very encouraging results.

    "preprint_abstract": "Many plant species have floral morphologies that restrict access to floral resources, such as pollen or nectar, and only a subset of floral visitors can perform the complex handling behaviours required to extract restricted resources. Due to the time and energy required to extract resources from morphologically complex flowers, these plant species potentially compete for pollinators with co-flowering plants that have more easily accessible resources. A widespread floral mechanism restricting access to pollen is the presence of tubular anthers that open through small pores or slits (poricidal anthers). Some bees have evolved the capacity to remove pollen from poricidal anthers using vibrations, giving rise to the phenomenon of buzz-pollination. These bee vibrations that are produced for pollen extraction are presumably energetically costly, and to date, few studies have investigated whether buzz-pollinated flowers may be at a disadvantage when competing for pollinators attention with plant species that present unrestricted pollen resources. Here, we studied Cyanella hyacinthoides (Tecophilaeaceae), a geophyte with poricidal anthers in the hyperdiverse Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, to assess how the composition and relative abundance of flowers with easily accessible pollen affect bee visitation to a buzz-pollinated plant. We found that the number of pollinator species was not influenced by community composition. However, visitation rates to C. hyacinthoides were negatively related to the abundance of flowers with more accessible resources. Visitation rates were strongly associated with petal colour, showing that flower colour is important in mediating these interactions. We conclude that buzz-pollinated plants might be at a competitive disadvantage when many easily accessible pollen sources are available, particularly when competitor species share its floral signals.",

Also, for most LSDs we do not know the impact of loss-of-function in individual cell types. Understanding these critical questions are essential to therapy development. Here, we determined the impact of genetic rescue in distinct cell types on neural circuit dysfunction in CLN3 disease, the most common pediatric dementia and a representative LSD. We restored Cln3 expression via AAV-mediated gene delivery and conditional genetic rescue in a CLN3 mouse model. Surprisingly, we found that low-level rescue of Cln3 expression in neurons alone normalized clinically-relevant electrophysiologic markers of network dysfunction, despite the presence of substantial residual histopathology, in contrast to restoring expression in astrocytes. Thus, loss of Cln3 function in neurons, not storage accumulation, underlies neurologic dysfunction in CLN3 disease, implying that storage clearance may be an inappropriate target for therapy development and an ineffectual biomarker.",

Indeed, insulin resistance and aberrant hepatic lipid accumulation represent driving features of progressive non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ranging from simple steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis. Effective pharmacological regimens to stop progressive liver disease are still lacking to-date.\n\nMethodsBased on our previous discovery of transforming growth factor beta-like stimulated clone (TSC)22D4 as a key driver of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in obesity and type 2 diabetes, we generated a TSC22D4-hepatocyte specific knockout line (TSC22D4-HepaKO) and exposed mice to control or NASH diet models. Mechanistic insights were generated by metabolic phenotyping and single cell liver sequencing.\n\nResultsHepatic TSC22D4 expression was significantly correlated with markers of liver disease progression and fibrosis in both murine and human livers. Indeed, hepatic TSC22D4 levels were elevated in human NASH patients as well as in several murine NASH models. Specific genetic deletion of TSC22D4 in hepatocytes led to reduced liver lipid accumulation, improvements in steatosis and inflammation scores and decreased apoptosis in mice. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed a distinct gene signature identifying an upregulation of mitochondrial-related processes. An enrichment of genes involved in the TCA cycle, mitochondrial organization, and triglyceride metabolism underscored the hepatocyte-protective phenotype and overall decreased liver damage as seen in mouse models.\n\nConclusionsTogether, our data uncover a new connection between targeted depletion of TSC22D4 and intrinsic metabolic processes in progressive liver disease. Cell-specific reduction of TSC22D4 improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and promotes hepatocyte survival thus paving the way for further preclinical therapy developments.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hearing impairment is a common disease affecting a substantial proportion of the global population. Currently, the most effective clinical treatment for patients with sensorineural deafness is to implant an artificial electronic cochlea. However, the improvements to hearing perception are variable and limited among healthy subjects. Moreover, cochlear implants have disadvantages, such as crosstalk derived from the currents that spread into non-target tissue between the electrodes. Here, in this work, we describe terahertz wave modulation (THM), a new, minimally invasive technology that can enhance hearing perception in animals by reversible modulation of currents in cochlear hair cells. Using single-cell electrophysiology, guinea pig audiometry, and molecular dynamics simulations (MD), we show that THM can reversibly increase mechano-electrical transducer (MET) currents ([~]50% higher) and voltage-gated K+ currents in cochlear hair cells through collective resonance of -C=O groups. In addition, measurement of auditory brainstem response (ABR) in guinea pigs treated with THM indicated a [~]10 times increase in hearing sensitivity. This study thus reports a new method of highly spatially selective hearing enhancement without introducing any exogeneous gene, which has potential applications for treatment of hearing disorders as well as several other areas of neuroscience.",

Although abnormal expression of methyltransferase can lead to various diseases including cancers, little is known about the relationship between methyltransferase and cancers. Here we aimed to understand the role of methyltransferase in cancer metastasis. We found that elevated methyltransferase-like 9 (METTL9) is closely associated with the acquisition of metastatic activity in human scirrhous gastric cancers. The stable knockdown of METTL9 via an shRNA vector technique in our original metastatic cells from scirrhous gastric cancer patients significantly inhibited migration and invasion.

In a number of recent papers, the performance of deep learning models have continually been reported as an improvement over alternatives for sequence-based promoter recognition. However, the performance improvements in these models do not account for the different datasets that models are being evaluated on. The lack of a consensus dataset and procedure for benchmarking purposes has made the comparison of each models true performance difficult to assess.\n\nWe present a framework called Supervised Promoter Recognition Framework ( SUPR REF) capable of streamlining the complete process of training, validating, testing, and comparing promoter recognition models in a systematic manner. SUPR REF includes the creation of biologically relevant benchmark datasets to be used in the evaluation process of deep learning promoter recognition models. We showcase this framework by comparing the models performance on alternative datasets, and properly evaluate previously published models on new benchmark datasets. Our results show that the reliability of deep learning ab initio promoter recognition models on eukaryotic genomic sequences is still not at a sufficient level, as precision is severely lacking. Furthermore, given the observational nature of these data, cross-validation results from small datasets need to be interpreted with caution.\n\nAvailabilitySource code and documentation of the framework is available online at https://github.com/ivanpmartell/suprref",

To verify protein genes differentially expressed in LCG, we performed PRM validation on three candidate proteins (ALB, SDC1 and ITGB4) in CT-LCG and FT-LCG.

In addition, we also derived a protein-protein interaction (PPI) regulatory network from the perspective of bioinformatics. This study sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism of differential proteins regulating cashmere fineness of Liaoning cashmere goats by using TMT quantitative proteomics analysis.

    "preprint_abstract": "ObjectiveTo study the neural control of movement, it is often necessary to estimate how muscles are activated across a variety of behavioral conditions. However, estimating the latent command signal that underlies muscle activation is challenging due to its complex relation with recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals. Common approaches estimate muscle activation independently for each channel or require manual tuning of model hyperparameters to optimally preserve behaviorally-relevant features.\n\nApproachHere, we adapted AutoLFADS, a large-scale, unsupervised deep learning approach originally designed to de-noise cortical spiking data, to estimate muscle activation from multi-muscle EMG signals. AutoLFADS uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the spatial and temporal regularities that underlie multi-muscle activation.\n\nMain ResultsWe first tested AutoLFADS on muscle activity from the rat hindlimb during locomotion, and found that it dynamically adjusts its frequency response characteristics across different phases of behavior. The model produced single-trial estimates of muscle activation that improved prediction of joint kinematics as compared to low-pass or Bayesian filtering. We also tested the generality of the approach by applying AutoLFADS to monkey forearm muscle activity from an isometric task. AutoLFADS uncovered previously uncharacterized high-frequency oscillations in the EMG that enhanced the correlation with measured force compared to low-pass or Bayesian filtering. The AutoLFADS-inferred estimates of muscle activation were also more closely correlated with simultaneously-recorded motor cortical activity than other tested approaches.\n\nSignificanceUltimately, this method leverages both dynamical systems modeling and artificial neural networks to provide estimates of muscle activation for multiple muscles that can be used for further studies of multi-muscle coordination and its control by upstream brain areas.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Genetic variants in SCN2A, encoding the NaV1.2 voltage-gated sodium channel, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Some variants fit into a framework wherein gain-of-function missense variants that increase neuronal excitability lead to infantile epileptic encephalopathy, while loss-of-function variants that reduce neuronal excitability lead to developmental delay and/or autism spectrum disorder with or without co- morbid seizures. One unique case less easily classified using this binary paradigm is the de novo missense variant SCN2A p.K1422E, associated with infant-onset developmental delay, infantile spasms, and features of autism spectrum disorder. Prior structure-function studies demonstrated that K1422E substitution alters ion selectivity of NaV1.2, conferring Ca2+ permeability, lowering overall conductance, and conferring resistance to tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on heterologous expression of K1422E, we developed a compartmental neuron model that predicted mixed effects on channel function and neuronal activity. We also generated Scn2aK1422E mice and characterized effects on neurons and neurological/neurobehavioral phenotypes. Dissociated neurons from heterozygous Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited a novel TTX-resistant current with a reversal potential consistent with mixed ion permeation. Cortical slice recordings from Scn2aK1442E/+ tissue demonstrated impaired action potential initiation and larger Ca2+ transients at the axon initial segment during the rising phase of the action potential, suggesting mixed effects on channel function. Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited rare spontaneous seizures, interictal EEG abnormalities, altered response to induced seizures, reduced anxiety-like behavior and alterations in olfactory-guided social behavior. Overall, Scn2aK1422E/+ mice present with phenotypes similar yet distinct from Scn2a knockout models, consistent with mixed effects of K1422E on NaV1.2 channel function.\n\nSignificance StatementThe early-onset epilepsy variant SCN2A-p.K1422E displays unique biophysical properties in vitro. To model the impact of this rare variant, we generated Scn2aK1422E mice. Neurons from heterozygous Scn2aK1422E/+ mice showed functional deficits similar to the loss-of-function effects observed in the Scn2a haploinsufficiency model, as well as gain-of-function effects specific to the K1422E variant. There is also some overlap in neurobehavioral phenotypes between Scn2aK1422E/+ and Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. However, Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited unique epilepsy-related phenotypes, including epileptiform events and seizures. Scn2aK1422E/+ mice serve as a useful platform to investigate phenotypic complexity of SCN2A-associated disorders.",

However, the huge amount of data in such records makes it difficult to carry out cell detection manually. Consequently, because the cell detection is the first step of multicellular data analysis, there is a pressing need for automatic cell detection methods for large-scale image data. Automatic cell detection algorithms have been pioneered by a handful of research groups. Such algorithms, however, assume a conventional field of view (FOV) (i.e. 512 x 512 pixels) and need a significantly higher computational power for a wider FOV to work within a practical period of time. To overcome this issue, we propose a method called low computational-cost cell detection (LCCD), which can complete its processing even on the latest ultra-large FOV data within a practical period of time. We compared it with two previously proposed methods, constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) and Suite2P. We found that LCCD makes it possible to detect cells from a huge-amount of high-density imaging data within a shorter period of time and with an accuracy comparable to or better than those of CNMF and Suite2P.",

(commonly known as Christmas Bush) has been used traditionally in Africa to treat sickle cell anaemia (a recessive disease, arising from the S haemoglobin [Hb] allele) but the active compounds are yet to be characterised. Herein we describe the use of sequential fractionation coupled with in vitro anti-sickling assays to purify the active component. Sickling was induced in HbSS genotype blood samples using sodium metabisulphite (Na2S2O5) or incubation in 100 % N2. Methanol extracts of A. cordifolia leaves and its sub-fractions showed >70 % suppression of HbSS erythrocyte sickling. Purified compound demonstrated 87.2 {+/-} 2.39 % significant anti-sickling activity and 93.1 {+/-} 2.69 % erythrocyte sickling-inhibition at 0.4 mg/mL. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and high-resolution mass spectroscopy identified it as quercitrin (quercetin 3-rhamnoside). Purified quercitrin also inhibited the polymerisation of isolated HbS and stabilized sickle erythrocytes membranes. Metabolomic comparisons of blood samples using flow-infusion electrospray-high resolution mass spectrometry indicated that quercitrin could convert HbSS erythrocyte metabolomes to be similar to HbAA. Sickling was associated with changes in anti-oxidants, anaerobic bioenergy and arachidonic acid metabolism, all of which were reversed by quercitrin. The findings described could inform efforts directed to the development of an anti-sickling drug or quality control assessments of A. cordifolia preparations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is an important oilseed crop in which the biochemical pathways leading to seed oil synthesis and accumulation have been widely studied. However, how these pathways are regulated is less well understood. The WRINKLED1 (WRI1) transcription factor is considered a master regulator in the transcriptional control of triacylglycerol biosynthesis, acting through the AW box binding element (CNTNG(N)7CG) that resides in the promoter of target genes. Here, we identified the sunflower WRI1 gene and characterized its activity in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We studied its role as a co-regulator of sunflower genes involved in plastidial fatty acid synthesis, identifying genes bound by this transcription factor. Sunflower WRI1-targets included genes encoding all subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the -CT and BCCP genes of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex, genes encoding acyl carrier proteins and key genes of the fatty acid synthase complex (KASIII, KASI and KAR), together with the FATA1 gene. As such, sunflower WRI1 regulates seed plastid fatty acid biosynthesis in a coordinated manner, establishing a WRI1 push and pull strategy that drives oleic acid synthesis for its export into the cytosol. We also analyzed the sequence of the functional sunflower AW box, determining the base bias at the N positions in the active sunflower AW box motif. Accordingly, we conclude that the sunflower AW box is sequence-sensitive at the non-conserved positions, enabling WRI1-binding. Moreover, we found that sunflower WRI1 could bind to a non-canonical AW-box motif, opening the possibility of searching for new target genes.",

Studying their virulence attributes can lead to better cryptococcosis prevention and treatment. In this work, we systematically investigated virulence attributes of Cryptococcus spp. clinical isolates and correlated them with patient data. We collected 66 C. neoformans and 19 C. gattii isolates from Brazilian patients and analyzed multiple phenotypes related with their capsule, production of laccase, melanin and extracellular vesicles. We also tested their virulence in Galleria mellonella and ability to evade macrophage LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). All phenotypes analyzed varied widely among the isolates, but C. neoformans isolates tended to melanize faster and more intensely and produce thinner capsules in comparison with C. gattii. We also observed correlations that match previous studies, such as that between secreted laccase - but not total melanin production - and disease outcome in patients. The most striking results, though, came from our measurements of Cryptococcus colony melanization kinetics, which followed a sigmoidal curve for most isolates. Faster melanization correlated positively with LAP evasion, virulence in G. mellonella and worse prognosis in humans. These results suggest that the speed of melanization, more than the total amount of melanin Cryptococcus spp. produces, is crucial for virulence.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=162 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/222794v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41c48borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce8e1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4568corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e2003_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The aim of this study is to assess the validity and reliability of the Kinect v2 for the assessment of 17 kinematic variables commonly used in the analysis of upper limb reaching in stroke.\n\nMethods26 healthy participants performed seated hand-reaching tasks while holding a dumbbell to induce a behaviour similar to that of a person with a stroke. 3D upper limb and trunk motion were simultaneously recorded with the Kinect v2 (Microsoft, USA) and with the VICON (OxfordMetrics, UK), the latter being the reference system. For each kinematic outcome, the validity of the Kinect was assessed with ICC, linear regression and Bland & Altman plots.\n\nResultsThe Kinect assesses trunk compensations, hand range of motion, movement time and mean velocity with a moderate to excellent reliability. In contrast, elbow and shoulder range of motion, time to peak velocity and path length ratio have a poor to moderate reliability, indicating that these variables should be interpreted with caution. Finally, instantaneous hand and elbow tracking are not precise enough to reliably assess Cartesian and angular kinematics over time, rendering variables such as the number of velocity peaks and the peak hand velocity unusable.\n\nConclusionsThanks to its ease of use and markerless properties, the Kinect can be used in clinical routine for semi-automated quantitative diagnostics guiding individualised rehabilitation of the upper limb. However, engineers and therapists must bear in mind the limitations of the Kinect for the instantaneous tracking of the hand and elbow.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Viruses are major pathogens of agricultural crops. Viral infections often start after the virus enters the outer layer of a tissue or surface and many successful viruses, after local replication in the infected tissue, are able to spread systemically. Quantitative details of virus dynamics in plants, however, have been poorly understood, in part, because of the lack of experimental methods allowing to accurately measure the degree of infection in individual plant tissues. Recently, by using flow cytometry and two different flourescently-labeled strains of the Tobacco etch virus (TEV), Venus and BFP, kinetics of viral infection of individual cells in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum plants was followed over time [1]. A simple mathematical model, assuming that viral spread occurs from lower to upper leaves, was fitted to these data. While the the original model could accurately describe the kinetics of viral spread locally and systemically, we also found that many alternative versions of the model, for example, if viral spread starts at upper leaves and progresses to lower leaves or when virus dissemination is stopped due to an immune response, provided fits of the data with reasonable quality, and yet with different parameter estimates. These results strongly suggest that experimental measurements of the virus infection in individual leaves may not be sufficient to identify the pathways of viral dissemination between different leaves and reasons for viral control; we propose experiments that may allow discrimination between the alternatives. By analyzing the kinetics of coinfection of individual cells by Venus and BFP strains of TEV we found a strong deviation from the random infection model, suggesting cooperation between the two strains when infecting plant cells. Importantly, we showed that many mathematical models on the kinetics of coinfection of cells with two strains could not adequately describe the data, and the best fit model needed to assume i) different susceptibility of uninfected cells to infection by two viruses locally in the leaf vs. systemically from other leaves, and ii) decrease in the infection rate depending on the fraction of uninfected cells which could be due to a systemic immune response. Our results thus demonstrate the difficulty in reaching definite conclusions from extensive and yet limited experimental data and provide evidence of potential cooperation between different viral variants infecting individual cells in plants.",

We show that mice immunised with these vaccine formulations elicit high titres of antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants VIC31 (with Spike: D614G mutation), Delta and Omicron (BA.1.1) VOC. Compared to VIC31, there was an average 14.4-fold reduction in neutralisation against BA.1.1 for the three monomeric antigen-adjuvant combinations, and 16.5-fold reduction for the three trimeric antigen-adjuvant combinations; the corresponding values against Delta were 2.5 and 3.0. Our findings suggest that monomeric formulations are suitable for the upcoming Phase I human clinical trials, and that there is potential for increasing efficacy with vaccine matching to improve responses against emerging variants. These findings are consistent with in silico modelling and AlphaFold predictions which show that while oligomeric presentation can be generally beneficial, it can make important epitopes inaccessible, and also carries the risk of eliciting unwanted antibodies against the oligomerisation domain.",

The challenge to computational studies of evacuation is that the base process, spontaneous evacuation by simple diffusion, is in the extreme rare event limit, meaning direct stochastic simulation is unfeasible. Here we combine particle-based spatial stochastic simulation with the Weighted Ensemble method for rare events to compute the mean first-passage time for cell surface availability by surface reorganization of CD45. We confirm mathematical estimates that, at physiological concentrations, spontaneous evacuation is extremely rare, roughly 300 years. We find that dimerization decreases the time required for evacuation. A weak bi-molecular interaction (dissociation constant estimate 460 microMolar) is sufficient for an order of magnitude reduction of spontaneous evacuation times, and oligomerization to hexamers reduces times to below 1 second. This introduces a mechanism whereby CD45 oligomerization could be accessible to an engineered therapeutic. For large regions of close-contact, such as those induced by large microvilli, molecular size and compressibility imply a nonzero re-entry probability 60%, decreasing evacuation times. Simulations show that these reduced evacuation times are still unrealistically long, suggesting that a yet-to-be-described mechanism, besides compressional exclusion at a close contact, drives evacuation.\n\nStatement of SignificanceIn the immune system, T cells sensing pathogens depends on a process called T cell receptor triggering. In this process, proteins on the cell surface undergo reorganization, including local depletion of large membrane proteins from the area surrounding the T cell receptor. Computer simulations of protein dynamics provide a means to investigate phenomena in greater detail than that afforded by experiments. However, even simulations present challenges, because tracking the motion and interactions of individual molecules is computationally expensive. Combining a rare event algorithm with spatial simulations, we show that biochemical and mechanical properties drastically affect depletion timescales, and thus receptor triggering. Quantitative understanding of these timescales will constrain hypothesized mechanistic models and could suggest new strategies for T cell engineering.",

The sucrose cleaving enzyme sucrose synthase (SUS) is thought to have a central role in UDP-glucose biosynthesis, and a long held and much debated hypothesis postulates that SUS is required to supply UDP-glucose to cellulose biosynthesis. To investigate the role of SUS in cellulose biosynthesis of Arabidopsis thaliana we characterized mutants in which four, or all six Arabidopsis SUS genes were disrupted. These sus mutants showed no growth phenotypes, vascular tissue cell wall defects or changes in cellulose content. Moreover, the UDP-glucose content of rosette leaves of the sextuple sus mutants was increased by approximately 20% compared to wild type. It can thus be concluded that cellulose biosynthesis is able to employ alternative UDP-glucose biosynthesis pathway(s), and thereby the model of SUS requirement for cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis can be refuted.",

Here we investigate the role of SIRT1 during development of chondrocytes by using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). HESC-chondroprogenitors were treated with SIRT1 activator; SRT1720, or inhibitor; EX527, at different development stages. Activation of SIRT1 during 3D-pellet culture led to significant increases in expression of ECM genes for type-II collagen (COL2A1) and aggrecan (ACAN), and chondrogenic transcription factors SOX5 and ARID5B, with SOX5 ChIP analysis demonstrating enrichment on the ACAN -10 enhancer. Unexpectedly, while ACAN was enhanced, GAG retention in the matrix was reduced when SIRT1 was activated. Significantly, ARID5B and COL2A1 were positively correlated, with Co-IP indicating association of ARID5B with SIRT1 suggesting that COL2A1 expression is promoted by an ARID5B and SIRT1 interaction. In conclusion, SIRT1 activation positively impacts on the expression of the main ECM proteins, whilst altering ECM composition and suppressing GAG content during cartilage development. These results suggest that SIRT1 activity can be beneficial to cartilage development and matrix protein synthesis but tailored by addition of other positive GAG mediators.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Patients with diabetes are unable to produce a sufficient amount of insulin to properly regulate their blood-glucose levels. One potential method of treating diabetes is to increase the number of insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas to enhance insulin secretion. It is known that during pregnancy, pancreatic beta cells proliferate in response to the pregnancy hormone, prolactin. Leveraging this proliferative response to prolactin may be a strategy to restore endogenous insulin production for patients with diabetes. To investigate this potential treatment, we previously developed a computational model to represent the prolactin-mediated JAK-STAT signaling pathway in pancreatic beta cells. However, this model does not account for variability in protein expression that naturally occurs between cells. Here, we applied the model to understand how heterogeneity affects the dynamics of JAK-STAT signaling. We simulated a sample of 10,000 heterogeneous cells with varying initial protein concentrations responding to prolactin stimulation. We used partial least squares regression to analyze the significance and role of each of the varied protein concentrations in producing the response of the cell. Our regression models predict that the concentrations of the cytosolic and nuclear phosphatases strongly influence the response of the cell. The model also predicts that increasing prolactin receptor strengthens negative feedback mediated by the inhibitor SOCS. These findings reveal biological targets that can potentially be used to modulate the proliferation of pancreatic beta cells to enhance insulin secretion and beta cell regeneration in the context of diabetes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cells organized into sheets break away and become motile mesenchymal cells. EMT plays a crucial role in wound healing, embryonic development, and cancer metastasis. Intracellular signaling in response to mechanical, topographic, or chemical stimuli can promote EMT. We present a multiscale model for EMT downstream of the protein YAP, which suppresses the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin and activates the GTPase Rac1 that enhances cell migration. We first propose an ODE model for YAP/Rac1/E-cadherin interactions. The model dynamics are bistable, accounting for motile loose cells as for adherent slower cells. We implement this model in a cellular Potts model simulation of 2D wound-healing using the open source platform Morpheus. We show that, under suitable stimuli (depicting topographic cues) the sheet exhibits finger-like projections and EMT. Morphological, as well as quantitative differences in YAP levels as well as cell speed across the sheet are consistent with preexisting experimental observations of epithelial sheets grown on topographic features in vitro. The simulation is also consistent with experiments that knockdown or over-express YAP, inhibit Rac1, or block E-cadherin.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEIn normal wound-healing, cell in an epithelium divide, grow, and migrate so as to seal a gap. In some pathological states, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can lead to abnormal morphology, including fingering, breakage of single cells or multicellular clusters from the sheet edge. The mechanochemical control of this behaviour by cell signaling circuits (YAP, Rac1, and E-cadherin) reveals how the competition between cell adhesion and cell migration contributes to the process. We use the open-source computational platform Morpheus to investigate a multiscale model for the interactions of the proteins inside cells and the resulting morphology of the cell sheet. Results are consistent with experimental results in the literature.",

    "preprint_abstract": "White spruce (Picea glauca) spans a massive range from arctic treeline to temperate forests, yet the variability in respiratory physiology and related implications for tree carbon balance at the extremes of this distribution remain as enigmas. Working at both the most northern and southern extents of the white spruce distribution range more than 5000 km apart, we measured the short- term temperature response of dark respiration (R/T) at upper and lower canopy positions. R/T curves were fit to both polynomial and thermodynamic models so that model parameters could be compared among locations, canopy positions, and with previously published data. Respiration measured at 25{degrees}C (R25) was 68% lower at the southern location than at the northern location (0.73{+/-}0.15 vs. 2.27{+/-}0.02 mol m-2 s-1), resulting in a significantly lower (p< 0.01) intercept in R/T response in temperate trees. Only at the southern location did upper canopy leaves have a steeper temperature response than lower canopy leaves, likely reflecting steeper canopy gradients in light. No differences were observed in the maximum temperature of respiration. At the northern range limit respiration is nearly twice that of the average R25 reported in a global leaf respiration database. This large carbon cost likely challenges tree survival and contributes to restricting the location of the northern treeline. We predict that without significant thermal acclimation, foliage respiration will increase with projected end-of-the-century warming and will likely constrain the future range limits of this important boreal species.\n\nSummary StatementWhite spruce (Picea glauca) needle respiration at the northern limit of the species range is three times higher than at the southern range limit (when measured at 25 {degrees}C). This high carbon cost likely challenges tree survival and contributes to the location of the northern treeline.",

Previous work has reported such spatially-global effects for low-level features such as color and orientation, as well as for faces. Here, using fMRI, we provide evidence for spatially-global attentional modulation for human bodies. Participants were cued to search for one of six object categories in two vertically-aligned images. Two additional, horizontally-aligned, images were simultaneously presented but were never task-relevant across three experimental sessions. Analyses time-locked to the objects presented in these task-irrelevant images revealed that responses evoked by body silhouettes were modulated by the participants top-down attentional set, becoming more body-selective when participants searched for bodies in the task-relevant images. These effects were observed both in univariate analyses of the body-selective cortex and in multivariate analyses of the object-selective visual cortex. Additional analyses showed that this modulation reflected response gain rather than a bias induced by the cues, and that it reflected enhancement of body responses rather than suppression of non-body responses. These findings provide evidence for a spatially-global attention mechanism for body shapes, supporting the rapid and parallel detection of conspecifics in our environment.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Spelling errors are ubiquitous in all writing systems. Most studies exploring spelling errors focused on the phonological plausibility of errors. However, unlike typical pseudohomophones, spelling errors occur in naturally produced written language with variable frequencies. We investigated the time course of recognition of the most frequent orthographic errors in Russian (error in an unstressed vowel at the root) and the effect of word frequency on this process. During ERP recording, 26 native Russian speakers silently read high-frequency correctly spelled words, low-frequency correctly spelled words, high-frequency words with errors, and low-frequency words with errors. The amplitude of P200 was more positive for correctly spelled words than for misspelled words and did not depend on the frequency of the words. Word frequency affected spelling recognition in the later stages of word processing (350-700 ms): high-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater P300 than high-frequency correctly spelled words, and low-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater N400 than low-frequency correctly spelled words. We observe spelling effects in the same time window for both the P300 and N400, which may reflect temporal overlap between mainly categorization processes based on orthographic properties for high-frequency words and phonological processes for low-frequency words. We concluded that two independent pathways can be active simultaneously during spelling recognition: one reflects mainly orthographic processing of high-frequency words and the other is the phonological processing of low-frequency words. Our findings suggest that these pathways are associated with different ERP components. Therefore, our results complement existing reading models and demonstrate that the neuronal underpinnings of spelling error recognition during reading depend on word frequency.",

Here, we investigated to what extend univariate and multivariate measures of post-stimulus alpha power are sensitive to the required spatial specificity of a task. To this end, we varied the perceptual load and the spatial demand in an auditory search paradigm. A centrally presented sound at the beginning of each trial indicated the to-be-localized target sound. This spatially unspecific pre-cue was followed by a sound array, containing either two (low perceptual load) or four (high perceptual load) simultaneously presented lateralized sound stimuli. In separate task blocks, participants were instructed either to report whether the target was located on the left or the right side of the sound array (low spatial demand) or to indicate the exact target location (high spatial demand). Univariate alpha lateralization magnitude was neither affected by perceptual load nor by spatial demand. However, an analysis of onset latencies revealed that alpha lateralization emerged earlier in low (vs. high) perceptual load trials as well as in low (vs. high) spatial demand trials. Finally, we trained a classifier to decode the specific target location based on the multivariate alpha power scalp topography. A comparison of decoding accuracy in the low and high spatial demand conditions suggests that the amount of spatial information present in the scalp distribution of alpha-band power increases as the task demands a higher degree of spatial specificity. Altogether, the results offer new insights into how the dynamic adaption of alpha-band oscillations in response to changing task demands is associated with post-stimulus attentional processing.",

The altered RBC morphology likely influences their biomechanical properties which are crucial for the cells to pass the microvasculature. Here, we investigated blood cell deformability of 5 ChAc patients compared to healthy controls during up to one-year individual off-label treatment with the tyrosine kinases inhibitor dasatinib or several weeks with lithium. Measurements with two microfluidic techniques allowed us to assess RBC deformability under different shear stresses. Furthermore, we characterized leukocyte stiffness at high shear stresses. The results show that blood cell deformability - including both RBCs and leukocytes - in general is altered in ChAc patients compared to healthy donors. Therefore, this study shows for the first time an impairment of leukocyte properties in ChAc. During treatment with dasatinib or lithium, we observe alterations in RBC deformability and a stiffness increase for leukocytes. The hematological phenotype of ChAc patients hints at a reorganization of the cytoskeleton in blood cells which partly explains the altered mechanical properties observed here. These findings highlight the need for a systematic assessment of the contribution of impaired blood cell mechanics to the clinical manifestation of ChAc.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Preterm birth is closely associated with diffuse white matter dysmaturation inferred from diffusion MRI and neurocognitive impairment in childhood. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) are distinct dMRI modalities, yet metrics derived from these two methods share variance across tracts. This raises the hypothesis that dimensionality reduction approaches may provide efficient whole-brain estimates of white matter microstructure that capture (dys)maturational processes. To investigate the optimal model for accurate classification of generalised white matter dysmaturation in preterm infants we assessed variation in DTI and NODDI metrics across 16 major white matter tracts using principal component analysis and structural equation modelling, in 79 term and 141 preterm infants at term equivalent age. We used logistic regression models to evaluate performances of single-metric and multimodality general factor frameworks for efficient classification of preterm infants based on variation in white matter microstructure. Single-metric general factors from DTI and NODDI capture substantial shared variance (41.8-72.5%) across 16 white matter tracts, and two multimodality factors captured 93.9% of variance shared between DTI and NODDI metrics themselves. General factors associate with preterm birth and a single model that includes all seven DTI and NODDI metrics provides the most accurate prediction of microstructural variations associated with preterm birth. This suggests that despite global covariance of dMRI metrics in neonates, each metric represents information about specific (and additive) aspects of the underlying microstructure that differ in preterm compared to term subjects.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe measured variation of 7 DTI and NODDI metrics across 16 major tracts\nC_LIO_LIGeneral factors for DTI and NODDI capture substantial shared variance across tracts\nC_LIO_LIGeneral factors also capture substantial shared variance between DTI and NODDI\nC_LIO_LISingle-metric and multimodality factors associate with gestational age at birth\nC_LIO_LIThe best preterm prediction model contains all 7 single-metric g-factors\nC_LI",

Omicron has evolved multiple mutations within the spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD), raising concerns of increased antibody evasion. Here, we isolated infectious omicron from a clinical specimen obtained in Canada. The neutralizing activity of sera from 65 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine recipients and convalescent individuals against clinical isolates of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, beta, delta, and omicron VOCs was assessed. Convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by the ancestral virus during the first wave of COVID-19 in Canada (July, 2020) demonstrated reduced neutralization against beta and omicron VOCs. Convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by the delta variant (May-June, 2021) neutralized omicron to significantly lower levels compared to the delta variant. Sera from individuals that received three doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines demonstrated reduced neutralization of the omicron variant relative to ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Sera from individuals that were naturally infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody levels against ancestral virus and all VOCs. Importantly, infection alone, either with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 or the delta variant was not sufficient to induce high neutralizing antibody titers against omicron. This data will inform current booster vaccination strategies, and we highlight the need for additional studies to identify longevity of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and optimal neutralizing antibody levels that are necessary to prevent infection and/or severe COVID-19.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundMany long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been extensively identified in many higher eukaryotic species. The function of lncRNAs has been reported to play important roles in diverse biological processes, including developmental regulation and behavioral plasticity. However, there are no reports of systematic characterization of long non-coding RNAs in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta.\n\nResultsIn this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNAs in the brains of S. invicta from RNA-seq. In total, 1,393 novel lncRNA transcripts were identified in the fire ant. In contrast to the annotated lncRNA transcripts having at least two exons, novel lncRNAs are monoexonic transcripts with a shorter length. Besides, the transcriptome from virgin alate and dealate mated queens were analyzed and compared. The results showed 295 differentially expressed mRNA genes (DEGs) and 65 differentially expressed lncRNA genes (DELs) between virgin and mated queens, of which 17 lncRNAs were highly expressed in the virgin alates and 47 lncRNAs were highly expressed in the mated dealates. By identifying the DEL:DEG pairs with high association in their expression (Spearmans |rho| > 0.8 and p-value < 0.01), many DELs were co-regulated with DEGs after mating. Furthermore, several remarkable lncRNAs (MSTRG.6523, MSTRG.588, and nc909) that were found to associate with particular coding genes may play important roles in the regulation of brain gene expression in reproductive transition in fire ants.\n\nConclusionThis study provides the first genome-wide identification of S. invicta lncRNAs in the brains in different reproductive states and will contribute to a fuller understanding of the transcriptional regulation underpinning reproductive changes.",

Here, we developed and comprehensively characterized a diverse biobank of normal and breast cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs) with a focus on TNBCs. PDOs recapitulated patient tumor intrinsic properties and a subset of PDOs can be propagated for long-term culture (LT-TNBCs). Single cell profiling of PDOs identified cell types and gene candidates affiliated with different aspects of cancer progression. The LT-TNBC organoids exhibit signatures of aggressive MYC-driven basal-like breast cancers and are largely comprised of luminal progenitor (LP)-like cells. The TNBC LP-like cells are distinct from normal LPs and exhibit hyperactivation of NOTCH and MYC signaling. Overall, our study validates TNBC PDOs as robust models for understanding breast cancer biology and progression, paving the way for personalized medicine and tailored treatment options.\n\nStatement of SignificanceA comprehensive analysis of TNBC patient-derived organoids is presented by genomic, transcriptomic, and in-vivo analyses, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and mechanisms of tumorigenesis at the single cell level.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Endogenous remyelination in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is contingent upon the successful differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Signaling via the Gq-coupled muscarinic receptor (M1/3R) inhibits human OPC differentiation and impairs endogenous remyelination in experimental models. We hypothesized that calcium release following Gq-coupled receptor (GqR) activation directly regulates human OPC (hOPC) cell fate. In this study, we show that specific GqR agonists activating muscarinic and metabotropic glutamate receptors induce characteristic oscillatory calcium release in hOPCs and that these agonists similarly block hOPC maturation in vitro. Both agonists induce calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores and store operated calcium entry (SOCE) likely via STIM/ORAI-based channels. siRNA mediated knockdown (KD) of obligate calcium sensors STIM1 and STIM2 decreased the magnitude of muscarinic agonist induced oscillatory calcium release and attenuated SOCE in hOPCs. In addition, STIM2 expression was necessary to maintain the frequency of calcium oscillations and STIM2 KD reduced spontaneous OPC differentiation. Furthermore, STIM2 siRNA prevented the effects of muscarinic agonist treatment on OPC differentiation suggesting that SOCE is necessary for the anti-differentiative action of muscarinic receptor-dependent signaling. Finally, using a gain-of-function approach with an optogenetic STIM lentivirus, we demonstrate that independent activation of SOCE was sufficient to significantly block hOPC differentiation and this occurred in a frequency dependent manner while increasing hOPC proliferation. These findings suggest that intracellular calcium oscillations directly regulate hOPC fate and that modulation of calcium oscillation frequency may overcome inhibitory Gq-coupled signaling that impairs myelin repair.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this study, Seidman et al. show that SOCE is a common component of ligand-based Gq-coupled signaling in hOPCs and that SOCE alone is sufficient to block hOPC differentiation and drive proliferation. Therefore, SOCE blocks differentiation and pathological SOCE could contribute to myelin disease.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Horneridae (Cyclostomata; Cancellata) is a family of marine bryozoans that form tree-like colonies bearing functionally unilaminate branches. Colony development in this clade is not well understood. We used micro-CT and SEM to trace zooidal budding in Hornera from the ancestrula onwards. Results show that hornerid branches are constructed by dual zooidal budding modes occurring synchronously at two separate budding sites at the growing tips. Frontal autozooids bud from a multizooidal budding lamina. Lateral autozooids bud from discrete abfrontal budding loci by  exomural budding, a previously undescribed form of budding centred on hypostegal pores in interzooidal grooves on the colonial body wall. These two budding modes are integrated during primary branch morphogenesis, forming composite, developmentally bilaminate, branches. Tracing development back to the founding zooids shows that the ancestrula and adventitious periancestrular autozooids are the first-formed lateral autozooids. They grow as a vertical stem onto which new laterals bud exomurally, intercalating with earlier autozooids to form an expanding funnel. The inner wall of this funnel becomes a ring-shaped budding lamina, from which the first frontal autozooids bud centripetally. When the branch crown splits, the ring lamina is subdivided, each fragment becoming a paramedial budding lamina in its own branch, while new laterals continue to be budded exomurally onto the frontal walls of existing laterals. Co-occurrence of two rare cyclostome frontal budding types--adventitious budding on the ancestrula and exomural budding on the branches--suggests they may be homologous. Patterns of exomural budding vary among hornerids. Narrow-branched taxa possess a single medial line of budding sites on the abfrontal wall; wide-branched species have up to six parallel lines of loci. Exomural budding also occurs sporadically in Calvetia osheai, a radial-branching hornerid. Future studies of cancellate taxonomy and phylogeny may benefit from morphological concepts presented here.",

Several of these counteradaptations have been elucidated at the molecular level, in particular for insects specialized on cruciferous host plants. While the importance of these counteradaptations for host plant colonization is well established,little is known about their microevolutionary dynamics in the field. In this study, we examine patterns of host plant use and insect counteradaptation in three Pieris butterfly species across Japan. The larvae of these butterflies express nitrile-specifier protein (NSP) and its paralog major allergen (MA) in their gut to overcome the highly diversified glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system of their cruciferous host plants. Pieris napi and Pieris melete colonize wild Brassicaceae whereas Pieris rapae typically uses cultivated Brassica as a host, regardless of the local composition of wild crucifers. As expected, NSP and MA diversity was independent of the local composition of wild Brassicaceae in P. rapae. In contrast, NSP diversity correlated with local host plant diversity in both species that preferred wild Brassicaceae. P. melete and P. napi both revealed two distinct major NSP alleles, which shaped diversity among local populations, albeit with different evolutionary trajectories. In comparison, MA showed no indication for local adaptation. Altogether, MA appeared to be evolutionary more conserved than NSP, suggesting that both genes play different roles in diverting host plant chemical defense.",

Since a portion of the global population harbors some level of immunity from vaccines based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 sequence or natural infection, an important question going forward is whether this immunity can be boosted by next-generation vaccines that target emerging variants while simultaneously maintaining long-term protection against existing strains. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of INO-4800, our synthetic DNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19 currently in clinical evaluation, and INO-4802, a next-generation DNA vaccine designed to broadly target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, as booster vaccines in nonhuman primates. Rhesus macaques primed over one year prior with the first-generation INO-4800 vaccine were boosted with either INO-4800 or INO-4802 in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens. Both boosting schedules led to an expansion of antibody responses which were characterized by improved neutralizing and ACE2 blocking activity across wild-type SARS-CoV-2 as well as multiple variants of concern. These data illustrate the durability of immunity following vaccination with INO-4800 and additionally support the use of either INO-4800 or INO-4802 in prime-boost regimens.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The genus Neisseria includes two pathogenic species, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, and numerous commensal species. Neisseria species frequently exchange DNA with one other, primarily via transformation and homologous recombination, and via multiple types of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Few Neisseria bacteriophages (phages) have been identified and their impact on bacterial physiology is poorly understood. Furthermore, little is known about the range of species that Neisseria phages can infect. In this study, we used three virus prediction tools to scan 248 genomes of 21 different Neisseria species and identified 1302 unique predicted prophages. Using comparative genomics, we found that many predictions are dissimilar from other prophages and MGEs previously described to infect Neisseria species. We also identified similar predicted prophages in genomes of different Neisseria species. Additionally, we examined CRISPR-Cas targeting of each Neisseria genome and predicted prophage. While CRISPR targeting of chromosomal DNA appears to be common among several Neisseria species, we found that 20% of the prophages we predicted are targeted significantly more than the rest of the bacterial genome in which they were identified (i.e., backbone). Furthermore, many predicted prophages are targeted by CRISPR spacers encoded by other species. We then used these results to infer additional host species of known Neisseria prophages and predictions that are highly targeted relative to the backbone. Together, our results suggest that we have identified novel Neisseria prophages, several of which may infect multiple Neisseria species. These findings have important implications for understanding horizontal gene transfer between members of this genus.\n\nIMPORTANCEDrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major threat to human health. Commensal Neisseria species are thought to serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes for the pathogenic species N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. Therefore, it is important to understand both the diversity of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that can mediate horizontal gene transfer within this genus, and the breadth of species these MGEs can infect. In particular, few bacteriophages (phages) have been identified and characterized in Neisseria species. In this study, we identified a large number of candidate phages integrated within the genomes of commensal and pathogenic Neisseria species, many of which appear to be novel phages. Importantly, we discovered extensive interspecies targeting of predicted phages by Neisseria CRISPR-Cas systems, which may reflect their movement between different species. Uncovering the diversity and host range of phages is essential for understanding how they influence the evolution of their microbial hosts.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is a highly invasive tumor and, despite the development of recent therapies, most patients with advanced metastatic melanoma have a poor clinical outcome. The most frequent mutations in melanoma affect the BRAF oncogene, a protein kinase of the MAPK signaling pathway. Therapies targeting both BRAF and MEK are effective for only 50% of patients and, almost systematically, generate drug resistance. Genetic and non-genetic mechanisms associated with the strong heterogeneity and plasticity of melanoma cells have been suggested to favor drug resistance but are still poorly understood. Recently, we have introduced a novel mathematical formalism allowing the representation of the relation between tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance and proposed several models for the development of resistance of melanoma treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. In this paper, we further investigate this relationship by using a new computational model that copes with multiple cell states identified by single cell mRNA sequencing data in melanoma treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We use this model to predict the outcome of different therapeutic strategies. The reference therapy, referred to as \"continuous\" consists in applying one drug (or several drugs) without disruption. In \"combination therapy\", several drugs are used sequentially. In \"adaptive therapy\" drug application is interrupted when the tumor size is below a lower threshold and resumed when the size goes over an upper threshold. We show that, counter-intuitively, the optimal protocol in combination therapy of BRAF/MEK inhibitors with a hypothetical drug targeting cell states that develop later during the tumor response to kinase inhibitors, is to treat first with this hypothetical drug. Also, even though there is little difference in the timing of emergence of the resistance between continuous and adaptive therapies, the spatial distribution of the different melanoma subpopulations is more zonated in the case of adaptive therapy.",

We test the (moderated) t-tests and the Fishers exact test for feature selection, principal component analysis (PCA) as well as iterative supervised PCA (ISPCA) for feature generation, and GLMnet and logistic regression methods with sparsity promoting priors for classification. Probabilistic programming language Stan is used to implement Bayesian inference for the probabilistic models.\n\nResults and conclusionsWe compare overlaps of differentially methylated genomic regions as chosen by different feature selection methods, and evaluate probabilistic classifiers by evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores on discovery and validation cohorts. While we observe that many methods perform equally well as, and occasionally considerably better than, GLMnet that was originally proposed for cfMeDIP-seq based cancer classification, we also observed that performance of different methods vary across sequencing depths, cancer types and study cohorts.

Earlier we reported that purinergic 2Y1 receptor (P2Y1-R) activation rejuvenates shearstress induced nitric oxide (NO) generation in bovine aortic endothelial cells that is otherwise compromised after pharmacological and genetic autophagy repression. Here we determined the translational and functional relevance of these findings.\n\nApproach and ResultsFirst we assessed translational relevance using older humans and mice that exhibit blunted EC autophagy at rest together with impaired arterial function vs. appropriate controls. Rhythmic handgrip exercise elevated radial artery shear rate similarly in adult and older males for 60-min. Compared to baseline, autophagy initiation, p-eNOSS1177 activation, and NO generation, occurred in radial artery ECs from adult but not older subjects. Regarding mice, indexes of autophagy and p-eNOSS1177 activation were robust in ECs from adult but not older mice in response to 60-min treadmill-running. Next we questioned whether an inability to initiate EC autophagy precipitates arterial dysfunction. Age-associated reductions in intraluminal flow-mediated vasodilation observed in older vs. adult mice were recapitulated in arteries from adult mice by : (i) NO synthase inhibition; (ii) autophagy impairment using 3-methyladenine (3-MA); (iii) EC Atg3 depletion (iecAtg3KO mice); (iv) P2Y1-R blockade; and (v) germline depletion of P2Y1-Rs. Importantly, P2Y1-R activation using 2-methylthio-ADP (2-Me-ADP) improved vasodilatory capacity in arteries from : (i) adult mice treated with 3-MA; (ii) adult iecAtg3KO mice; and (iii) older animals with repressed EC autophagy.\n\nConclusionsArterial dysfunction concurrent with pharmacological, genetic, and age-associated EC autophagy compromise is improved by activating P2Y1-Rs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Combining experiments with artificial intelligence algorithms, we propose a new machine learning based approach to extract the cellular force distributions from the microscope images. The full process can be divided into three steps. First, we culture the cells on a special substrate allowing to measure both the cellular traction force on the substrate and the corresponding substrate wrinkles simultaneously. The cellular forces are obtained using the traction force microscopy (TFM), at the same time that cell-generated contractile forces wrinkle their underlying substrate. Second, the wrinkle positions are extracted from the microscope images. Third, we train the machine learning system with GAN (generative adversarial network) by using sets of corresponding two images, the traction field and the input images (raw microscope images or extracted wrinkle images), as the training data. The network understands the way to convert the input images of the substrate wrinkles to the traction distribution from the training. After sufficient training, the network is utilized to predict the cellular forces just from the input images. Our system provides a powerful tool to evaluate the cellular forces efficiently because the forces can be predicted just by observing the cells under the microscope, which is a way simpler method compared to the TFM experiment. Additionally, the machine learning based approach presented here has the profound potential for being applied to diverse cellular assays for studying mechanobiology of cells.\n\nSignificance StatementCell-generated forces are indispensable determinants of fundamental cell functions such as motility and cell division. As such, quantifying how the forces change upon perturbations to the cells such as gene mutations and drug administration is of profound importance. Here we present a novel machine learning based system that allows for efficient estimations of the forces that are determined only by \"observing\" microscope images. Given that the cellular traction forces are regulated downstream of diverse signaling pathways, our system - that helps significantly improve the throughput of the measurements - presents a new, high throughput platform for real time analysis of the effects of a massive number of genetic and molecular perturbations on the forces and resulting cell mechanics.",

Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most promising biodegradable materials because of its potential applications in disposable packaging, agriculture, medicine, and printing filaments for 3D printers4-6. However, current biosynthesis of PLA entirely uses edible biomass as feedstock, which leads to competition for resources between material production and food supply7,8. Meanwhile, excessive emission of CO2 that is the most abundant carbon source aggravates global warming, and climate instability. Herein, we first developed a cyanobacterial cell factory for the de novo biosynthesis of PLA directly from CO2, using a combinational strategy of metabolic engineering and high-density cultivation (HDC). Firstly, the heterologous pathway for PLA production, which involves engineered D-lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), propionate CoA-transferase (PCT), and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase, was introduced into Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. Subsequently, different metabolic engineering strategies, including pathway debottlenecking, acetyl-CoA self-circulation, and carbon-flux redirection, were systematically applied, resulting in approximately 19-fold increase to 15 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) PLA compared to the control. In addition, HDC increased cell density by 10-fold. Finally, the PLA titer of 108 mg/L (corresponding to 23 mg/g DCW) was obtained, approximately 270 times higher than that obtained from the initially constructed strain. Moreover, molecular weight (Mw, 62.5 kDa; Mn, 32.8 kDa) of PLA produced by this strategy was among the highest reported levels. This study sheds a bright light on the prospects of plastic production from CO2 using cyanobacterial cell factories.",

In mouse olfactory epithelium, the centrioles originate in progenitor cells near the basal lamina, often 50 to 100 m from the apical surface. It is unknown how centrioles traverse this distance or mature to form cilia. Using high-resolution expansion microscopy, we found that centrioles migrate together, with multiple centrioles per group and multiple groups per OSN, during dendrite outgrowth. Centrioles were found by live imaging to migrate slowly, with a maximum rate of 0.18 m/min. Centrioles in migrating groups were associated with microtubule nucleation factors, but acquired rootletin and appendages only in mature OSNs. The parental centriole had preexisting appendages, formed a single cilium prior to other centrioles, and retained its unique appendage configuration in the mature OSN. We developed an air-liquid interface explant culture system for OSNs and used it to show that centriole migration can be perturbed ex vivo by stabilizing microtubules. We consider these results in the context of a comprehensive model for centriole formation, migration, and maturation in this important sensory cell type.",

Selective optogenetic stimulation and inhibition of hippocampal inputs to the AHN revealed that the HPC[-&gt;]AHN pathway not only mediates the contextual memory of predator threats but also controls the goal-directed escape by transmitting information about the surrounding environment.

Here, we used photobleaching properties of iGluSnFR, a fluorescent probe that detects glutamate, to investigate the subsynaptic organization of evoked and spontaneous release. In non-neuronal cells and neuronal dendrites, iGluSnFR fluorescence is intensely photobleached and recovers via diffusion of non-photobleached probes within 10-seconds. After photobleaching, while evoked iGluSnFR events could be rapidly suppressed, their recovery required several hours. In contrast, iGluSnFR responses to spontaneous release were comparatively resilient to photobleaching, unless the complete pool of iGluSnFR was activated by glutamate perfusion. This differential effect of photobleaching on different modes of neurotransmission is consistent with a subsynaptic organization where sites of evoked glutamate release are clustered and corresponding iGluSnFR probes are diffusion restricted, while spontaneous release sites are broadly spread across a synapse with readily diffusible iGluSnFR probes.",

Besides, a specific mechanism of SpeG function conferring pathogenic fitness to Staphylococcus aureus USA300 strain is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that although spermidine mitigates oxidative stress by lowering hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide levels, excess of it simultaneously triggers the production of superoxide radicals, thereby causing toxicity in the E. coli {Delta}speG strain as well as naturally SpeG-deficient S. aureus RN4220 strain. However, wild-type E. coli and S. aureus USA300 with a horizontally-acquired speG gene tolerate applied exogenous spermidine stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while RNA-bound spermidine inhibits iron oxidation, free spermidine interacts and oxidizes the iron to evoke superoxide radicals directly. Superoxide radicals thus generated, further affects redox balance and iron homeostasis. Since iron acquisition and metabolism in the host tissues is a challenging task for S. aureus, the current findings helped us explain that the evolutionary gain of SpeG function by S. aureus USA300 strain allows it to neutralize exogenous spermidine- and spermine-mediated toxicity towards iron metabolism inside the host tissues.",

To understand the consequences of the physical forces underlying genome organization, we build a coarse-grained polymer model of the genome, featuring three fundamentally distinct classes of interactions: lengthwise compaction, i.e., compaction of chromosomes along its contour, self-adhesion among epigenetically similar genomic segments, and adhesion of chromosome segments to the nuclear envelope or lamina. We postulate that these three types of interactions sufficiently represent the concerted action of the different proteins organizing the genome architecture and show that an interplay among these interactions can recapitulate the architectural variants observed across the tree of life. The model elucidates how an interplay of forces arising from the three classes of genomic interactions can drive drastic, yet predictable, changes in the global genome architecture, and makes testable predictions. We posit that precise control over these interactions in vivo is key to the regulation of genome architecture.",

While live-attenuated yellow fever virus vaccines based on three substrains of 17D are considered some of the most effective vaccines in use, problems with production and distribution have created large populations of unvaccinated, vulnerable individuals in endemic areas. To date, specific antiviral therapeutics have not been licensed for human use against YFV or any other related flavivirus. Recent advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology have allowed for identification of numerous candidate therapeutics targeting highly pathogenic viruses, including many flaviviruses. Here, we sought to identify a highly neutralizing antibody targeting YFV envelope (E) protein as a therapeutic candidate. We used human B cell hybridoma technology to isolate mAbs from the circulating memory B cells from human YFV vaccine recipients. These antibodies bound to recombinant YFV E protein and recognized at least five major antigenic sites on E. Two mAbs (designated YFV-136 and YFV-121) recognized a shared antigenic site and neutralized the YFV 17D vaccine strain in vitro. YFV-136 also potently inhibited infection by multiple wild-type YFV strains, in part, at a post-attachment step in the virus replication cycle. YFV-136 showed therapeutic protection in two animal models of YFV challenge including hamsters and immunocompromised mice engrafted with human hepatocytes. These studies define features of the antigenic landscape on YFV E protein recognized by the human B cell response and identify a therapeutic antibody candidate that inhibits infection and disease caused by highly virulent strains of YFV.",

However, uncontrollable HERV-K expression in somatic cells has been implicated in several diseases. Here, we show that SOX2, which plays a key role in maintaining pluripotency of stem cells, is critical for the transcription of HERV-K LTR5Hs. HERV-K can undergo retrotransposition within producer cells in the absence of Env expression. Furthermore, new HERV-K integration sites were identified in a long-term culture of induced pluripotent stem cells, which express SOX2. Together, these results suggest the possibility that the strict dependence of HERV-K on SOX2 have allowed contribution of HERV-K to the protection of early embryos during evolution while limiting potentially harmful effects of HERV-K retrotransposition on host genome integrity to these early embryos.",

We therefore investigated mouse hippocampal neuron growth cones using cryo-electron tomography to directly visualise their three-dimensional subcellular architecture with molecular detail. Our data show the hexagonal arrays of actin bundles that form filopodia penetrate the growth cone interior and terminate in the transition zone. We directly observe the modulation of these and other growth cone actin bundles by alteration of individual F-actin helical structures. Blunt-ended microtubules predominate in the growth cone, frequently contain lumenal particles and carry lattice defects. Investigation of the effect of absence of doublecortin, a neurodevelopmental cytoskeleton regulator, on growth cone cytoskeleton shows no major anomalies in overall growth cone organisation or in F-actin subpopulations. However, our data suggest that microtubules sustain more structural defects, highlighting the importance of microtubule integrity during growth cone migration.\n\nSummary statementCryo-electron tomographic reconstruction of neuronal growth cone subdomains reveals distinctive F-actin and microtubule cytoskeleton architectures and modulation at molecular detail.",

Here, we use a theoretical model that captures both infection and information transmission processes to investigate how host sociality (contact effort) and parasite virulence (disease-associated mortality rate) (co)evolve. We show that selection for sociality (and in turn, virulence) depends on both the intrinsic costs and benefits of social information and infection as well as their relative prevalence in the population. Specifically, greater sociality and lower virulence evolve when the risk of infection is either low or high and social information is neither very common nor too rare. Lower sociality and higher virulence evolve when the prevalence patterns are reversed. When infection and social information are both at moderate levels in the population, the direction of selection depends on the relative costs and benefits of being infected or informed. We also show that sociality varies inversely with virulence, and that parasites may be unable to prevent runaway selection for higher contact efforts. Together, these findings provide new insights for our understanding of group living and how apparently opposing ecological processes can influence the evolution of sociality and virulence in a range of ways.",

Combining qRIC with phosphoproteomics allowed us to systematically compare pull-down efficiencies of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of RBPs. Over hundred phosphorylation events increased or decreased pull-down efficiency compared to the unmodified RBPs and thus have regulatory potential. Our data captures known regulatory phosphorylation sites in ELAVL1, SF3B1 and UPF1 and identifies new potentially regulatory sites. Follow-up experiments on the cardiac splicing regulator RBM20 revealed that multiple phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal disordered region affect nucleo-cytoplasmic localization, association with cytosolic RNA granules and alternative splicing. Together, we show that qRIC is a scalable method to identify functional posttranslational modification sites in RBPs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIqRIC globally quantifies the fraction of RNA-binding proteins pulled down with mRNA\nC_LIO_LICombining qRIC with phosphoproteomics identifies sites that affect RNA binding\nC_LIO_LIPhosphorylation sites in RBM20 regulate its function in splicing\nC_LI",

Here, we show that hPSCs failed to differentiate and contribute teratoma in presence of mouse PSCs (mPSCs). While, MYCN, a pro-growth factor dramatically promotes hPSC contribution in teratoma co-formation by hPSCs/mPSCs. MYCN combined with BCL2 (M/B) greatly enhanced conventional hPSCs to integrate into preimplantation embryos of different species, such as mice, rabbits and pigs and substrantially contributed to mouse post-implantation chimera in embryonic and extra-embyonic tissues. Strikingly, M/B-hPSCs injected into preimplantation Flk-1+/- mouse embryos show further enhanced chimerism that allows obtaining live human CD34+ blood progenitor cells from chimeras through cell sorting. The chimera derived human CD34+ cells further gave rise to various subtype blood cells in typical colony forming unit(CFU) assay. Thus, we proof the concept to obtain functional human cells through enchanced interspecies chimerism with hPSCs.",

It has become clear that a significant number of severe viral infection cases are due to an overreaction of the immune system, which leads to hyperinflammation. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of the dexamethasone nanomedicine in controlling the symptoms of influenza infection. We found that the A/Wisconsin/WSLH34939/2009 (H1N1) infection induced severe pneumonia in mice with a death rate of 80%, accompanied by significant epithelial cell damage, infiltration of immune cells, and accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airway space. Moreover, the intranasal delivery of liposomal dexamethasone during disease progression reduced the death rate by 20%. It also significantly reduced the protein level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interleukin1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), IL-6, and the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) as well as the number of infiltrated immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids as compared to the free drug. It was found that the liposomal dexamethasone was mainly distributed into the monocyte/macrophages in the lungs, suggesting its mode of action via the specific delivery of the drug into myeloid cells as a major cell population for inducing the cytokine storm. Taken together, the intranasal delivery of liposomal dexamethasone may serve as a novel promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of influenza A-induced pneumonia.\n\nImportanceInfluenza A virus causes annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics of respiratory diseases. An excessive immune response, called a cytokine storm, caused by the influenza virus is the most common complication of influenza infection that is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Here, we report that the liposomal dexamethasone targeting the monocytes/macrophages during disease progression reduced the death rate as well as the protein level of inflammatory cytokines and the number of immune cells. Therefore, the findings of this study may be applied to address the limitations of the current strategies for the treatment of influenza.",

They are toxic to fungi, but far less to mammalian cells. One key difference between mammalian and fungal cell membranes is the presence of cholesterol only in the former; recent experimental work showed that the presence of cholesterol reduces fengycin-induced membrane leakage. (1) Since our previous all-atom and coarse-grained simulations (2, 3) suggested that aggregation of membrane-bound fengycin is central to its ability to disrupt membranes, we hypothesized that cholesterol might reduce fengycin aggregation. Here, we test this hypothesis using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, with sampling enhanced via the weighted ensemble method. The results indicate that cholesterol subtly alters the size distribution for fengycin aggregates, limits the lateral range of their membrane disordering, and reduces the ability of aggregates to bend the membrane. Taken together, these phenomena may account for cholesterols affects on fengycin activity.",

Despite many notable improvements to models over the years, many models do not accurately capture subtle biological and chemical characteristics of the cell such as high-order chromatin domains of the chromosomes. Topologically Associated Domains (TAD) are one of these genomic regions that are enriched for contacts within themselves. Here we present TAD-aware Regulatory Network Construction or TReNCo, a memory-lean method utilizing epigenetic marks of enhancer and promoter activity, and gene expression to create context-specific transcription factor-gene regulatory networks. TReNCo utilizes common assays, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and TAD boundaries as a hard cutoff, instead of distance based, to efficiently create context-specific TF-gene regulatory networks. We used TReNCo to define the enhancer landscape and identify transcription factors (TFs) that drive the cardiac development of the mouse.

L-lysine, an essential amino acid, is produced biologically in quantities exceeding two million tons per year; yet, L-lysine production is challenged by efficient export system at high titres during fermentation. To address this issue, new exporter candidates for efficient efflux of L-lysine are needed. Using metagenomic functional selection, we identified 58 genes encoded on 28 unique metagenomic fragments from cow gut microbiome library that improved L-lysine tolerance. These genes include a novel putative L-lysine transporter, belonging to a previously uncharacterized EamA superfamily. Characterization using Xenopus oocyte expression system as well as an Escherichia coli host demonstrates activity as a L-lysine transporter. This novel exporter improved L-lysine tolerance in E. coli by 40% and enhanced the specific productivity of L-lysine in an industrial Corynebacterium glutamicum strain by 12%. Our approach allows the sequence-independent discovery of novel exporters and can be deployed to increase titres and productivity of toxicity-limited bioprocesses.",

We controlled maturational factors such as chronological and biological age of adolescent female participants (11 to 15 years of age, n=114). We demonstrated that experience improves performance as a function of task complexity, the more complex task being more susceptible for experience driven performance changes. Overall, these results suggest that fine motor skills involving cognitive control and relying on long-range functional brain networks are substantially shaped by experience. On the other hand, performance in a simple repetitive task that explains fine motor speed is primarily shaped by white matter development driven by maturational factors.",

CSF inflow contributes during physiological conditions to clearance of metabolic waste and in pathological situations to edema formation. However, brain-wide imaging methods cannot resolve PVSs, and high-resolution methods cannot access deep tissue or be applied to human subjects, so theoretical models provide essential insight. We model this CSF pathway as a network of hydraulic resistances, built from published parameters. A few parameters have very wide uncertainties, so we focus on the estimated limits of their feasible ranges by analyzing different parametric scenarios. We identify low-resistance PVSs and high-resistance parenchyma (brain tissue) as the scenario that best explains experimental observations. Our results point to the most important parameters that should be measured in future experiments. Extensions of our modeling may help predict stroke severity or lead to neurological disease treatments and drug delivery methods.",

It has mutated several times after its first inception, with an estimated two mutations occurring every month. Although we have been successful in developing vaccines against the virus, emergence of variants has enabled it to escape therapy. Few of the generated variants are also reported to be more infectious than the wild-type (WT). In this study, we analyze the attributes of all RBD/ACE2 complexes for the reported VOCs, namely, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta through computer simulations. Results indicate differences in orientation and binding energies of the VOCs from the WT. Overall, it was observed that electrostatic interactions play a major role in the binding of the complexes. Detailed residue level energetics revealed that the most prominent changes in interaction energies were seen particularly at the mutated residues which were present at RBD/ACE2 interface. We found that the Delta variant is one of the most tightly bound variants of SARS-CoV-2 with dynamics similar to WT. High binding affinity of RBD towards ACE2 is indicative of an increase in the viral transmission and infectivity. The details presented in our study would prove extremely useful for the design and development of effective therapeutic strategies for the emerging variants of the virus.",

Our detailed examination of literature citing the RNA anti-lysozyme aptamer revealed that 93% of the 61 publications reviewed reported unexplained altered sequences with 86% of those using DNA variants. The ten most cited aptamers were examined using a standardized methodology in order to categorize the extent to which the sequences themselves were apparently improperly reproduced, both in the literature and presumably in experiments beyond their discovery. Our review of 800 aptamer publications spanned decades, multiple journals, and research groups, and revealed that 44% of the papers reported unexplained sequence alterations. We identified ten common categories of sequence alterations including deletions, substitutions, additions, among others. The robust data set we have produced elucidates a source of irreproducibility and unreliability in our field and can be used as a starting point for building evidence-based best practices in publication standards to elevate the rigor and reproducibility of aptamer research.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptomic and proteomic profiling of human brain tissue is hindered by availability of fresh samples from living patients. Postmortem samples usually represent the advanced disease stage of the patient. Furthermore, the postmortem interval affects the observed transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. Therefore, access to fresh brain tissue samples from living patients is valuable resource to obtain information on metabolically intact tissue. The implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into the human brain is a neurosurgical treatment for, e.g., movement disorders. Here, we describe an improved approach to collect brain tissue from surgical instruments used in implantation of DBS device for transcriptomics and proteomics analyses.\n\nMethodsSamples were extracted from guide tubes and recording electrodes used in routine DBS implantation procedure that was carried out to treat patients with Parkinsons disease, genetic dystonia and tremor. RNA sequencing was carried out to tissue extracted from the recording microelectrodes and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was carried out to analyze tissue from guide tubes. To assess the performance of the current approach, obtained datasets were compared with previously published datasets representing brain tissue.\n\nResultsIn RNA sequencing, altogether 32,034 transcripts representing unique Ensembl gene identifiers were detected from eight samples representing both hemispheres of four patients. By using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we identified 734 unique proteins from 31 samples collected from 14 patients. Comparison with previously published brain derived data indicated that both of our datasets reflected the expected brain tissue specific features. The datasets are available via BioStudies database (accession number S-BSST667).\n\nConclusionsSurgical instruments used in DBS installation retain enough brain material for protein and gene expression studies. Analysis of the datasets indicated that hemisphere-specific expression data can be obtained from individual patients without any sample pooling and without any modifications to the standard surgical protocol. Comparison with previously published datasets obtained with similar approach proved the robustness and reproducibility of the current improved protocol. This approach overcomes the issues that arise from using postmortem tissue, such as effect of postmortem interval, on proteomic and transcriptomic landscape of the brain and can be used for studying molecular aspects of DBS-treatable diseases.",

We perform RNA-Seq of whole blood tissue across 1490 individuals at low-coverage (5.9 million reads/sample) and show that the effective power is higher than that of an RNA-Seq study of 570 individuals at high-coverage (13.9 million reads/sample). Next, we leverage synthetic datasets derived from real RNA-Seq data to explore the interplay of coverage and number individuals in eQTL studies, and show that a 10-fold reduction in coverage leads to only a 2.5-fold reduction in statistical power.

We sampled individuals across a total of nine clans from these four groups and, additionally, three territorial sections within the Turkana and successfully genotyped 376 individuals.\n\nResultsHere we report that geography predominately shapes genetic variation within and among human groups in northern Kenya. We observed a clinal pattern of genetic variation that mirrors the overall geographic distribution of the individuals we sampled. We also found relatively higher rates of intermarriage between the Rendille and Samburu and evidence of gene flow between them that reflect these higher rates of intermarriage. Among the Turkana, we observed strong recent genetic substructuring based on territorial section affiliation. Within ethnolinguistic groups, we found that Y chromosome haplotypes do not consistently cluster by natal clan affiliation. Finally, we found that sampled populations that are geographically closer have lower genetic differentiation, and that cultural similarity does not predict genetic similarity as a whole across these northern Kenyan populations.\n\nDiscussionOverall, the results from this study highlight the importance of geography, even on a local geographic scale, in shaping observed patterns of genetic variation in human populations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infects almost 95% of the population worldwide. While typically asymptomatic, EBV latent infection is associated with several malignancies of epithelial and lymphoid origin in immunocompromised individuals. In latently infected cells, the EBV genome persists as a chromatinized episome that expresses a limited set of viral genes in different patterns, referred to as latency types, which coincide with varying stages of infection and various malignancies. We have previously demonstrated that latency types correlate with differences in the composition and structure of the EBV episome. Several cellular factors, including the nuclear lamina, regulate chromatin composition and architecture. While the interaction of the viral genome with the nuclear lamina has been studied in the context of EBV lytic reactivation, the role of the nuclear lamina in controlling EBV latency has not been investigated. Here, we report that the nuclear lamina is an essential epigenetic regulator of the EBV episome. We observed that in B cells, EBV infection affects the composition of the nuclear lamina by inducing the expression of lamin A/C, but only in EBV+ cells expressing the Type III latency program. Using ChIP-Seq, we determined that lamin B1 and lamin A/C bind the EBV genome, and their binding correlates with deposition of the histone repressive mark H3K9me2. By RNA-Seq, we observed that knock-out of lamin A/C in B cells alters EBV gene expression. Our data indicate that the interaction between lamins and the EBV episome contributes to the epigenetic control of viral gene expression during latency, suggesting a restrictive function of the nuclear lamina as part of the host response against viral DNA entry into the nucleus.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common herpesvirus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in a small fraction of B cells of the infected individuals. In most cases, EBV infection is asymptomatic; however, especially in the context of immune suppression, EBV latent infection is associated with several malignancies. In EBV+ cancer cells, latent viral gene expression plays an essential role in sustaining the cancer phenotype. We and others have established that epigenetic modifications of the viral genome are critical to regulating EBV gene expression during latency. Understanding how the EBV genome is epigenetically regulated during latent infection may help identify new specific therapeutic targets for treating EBV+ malignancies. The nuclear lamina is involved in regulating the composition and structure of the cellular chromatin. In the present study, we determined that the nuclear lamina binds the EBV genome during latency, influencing viral gene expression. Depleting one component of the nuclear lamina, lamin A/C, increased the expression of latent EBV genes associated with cellular proliferation, indicating that the binding of the nuclear lamina with the viral genome is essential to control viral gene expression in infected cells. Our data show for the first time that the nuclear lamina may be involved in the cellular response against EBV infection by restricting viral gene expression.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Segmenting three dimensional microscopy images is essential for understanding phenomena like morphogenesis, cell division, cellular growth and genetic expression patterns. Recently, deep learning (DL) pipelines have been developed which claim to provide high accuracy segmentation of cellular images and are increasingly considered as the state-of-the-art for image segmentation problems. However, it remains difficult to define their relative performances as the concurrent diversity and lack of uniform evaluation strategies makes it difficult to know how their results compare. In this paper, we first made an inventory of the available DL methods for 3 dimensional (3D) cell segmentation. We next implemented and quantitatively compared a number of representative DL pipelines, alongside a highly efficient non-DL method named MARS. The DL methods were trained on a common dataset of 3D cellular confocal microscopy images. Their segmentation accuracies were also tested in the presence of different image artifacts. A specific method for segmentation quality evaluation was adopted which isolates segmentation errors due to under/over segmentation. This is complemented with a 3D visualization strategy for interactive exploration of segmentation quality. Our analysis shows that the DL pipelines have different levels of accuracy. Two of them, which are end to end 3D and were originally designed for cell boundary detection, show high performance, and offer clear advantages in terms of adaptability to new data.\n\nAuthor summaryIn recent years a number of deep learning (DL) algorithms based on computational neural networks have been developed which claim to achieve high accuracy and automatic segmentation of 3D microscopy images. Although these algorithms have received considerable attention in the literature, it is difficult to evaluate their relative performances, while it remains unclear whether they really perform better than other, more classical segmentation methods.\n\nTo clarify these issues, we performed a detailed, quantitative analysis of a number of representative DL pipelines for cell instance segmentation from 3D confocal microscopy image datasets. We developed a protocol for benchmarking the performances of such DL based segmentation pipelines using common training and test datasets, evaluation metrics and visualizations. Using this protocol, we evaluated and compared four different DL pipelines to identify their strengths and limitations. A high performance non-DL method was also included in the evaluation. We show that DL pipelines may show significant differences in their performances depending on their model architecture and pipeline components but overall show excellent adaptability to unseen data. We also show that our benchmarking protocol could be extended to a variety of segmentation pipelines and datasets.",

A urease producer bacteria, Sporosarcina pasteurii, was used to induce the MICP process for the both simulant soils. An admixture of guar gum as an organic polymer and NiCl2, as bio-catalyst to enhance urease activity, was introduced to increase the compressive strength of the biologically grown bricks. A casting method was utilized for a slurry consisting of the appropriate simulant soil and microbe; the slurry over a few days consolidated in the form of a  brick of the desired shape. In case of MSS, maximum strength of 3.3 MPa was obtained with 10mM NiCl2 and 1% guar gum supplementation whereas in case of LSS maximum strength of 5.65 MPa was obtained with 1% guar gum supplementation and 10mM NiCl2. MICP mediated consolidation of the simulant soil was confirmed with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our work demonstrates a biological approach with an explicit casting method towards manufacturing of consolidated structures using extra-terrestrial regolith simulant; this is a promising route for in situ development of structural elements on the extra-terrestrial habitats.",

When such an expansion occurs, and a species colonizes a new region, it is important to monitor the habitat used by the species and use the information for updated management strategies. Water deer is listed as Vulnerable species in IUCN Red List and restricted to east central China and the Korean Peninsula. Since 2017 water deer has expanded its range towards northeast China and the Russian Far East. Our research focuses on data collected in northeast China and the Russian Far East during 2017-2021, with the purpose of providing support for a better understanding of habitat use and provide conservation suggestions. We used MaxEnt to model species niche and distribution and predict habitat suitability for water deer and applied the circuitscape to determine possible dispersal routes for the species. There is good quality habitat for water deer in the boundary area of the Yalu and Tumen River estuaries between China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East, as well as the east and west regions of the Korean Peninsula. Elevation, distance to cropland and water sources, and presence of wetlands were the variables that positively contributed to modelling the suitable habitats. Two possible dispersal routes were determined using the circuit theory, one was across the area from North Korea to the downstream Tumen transboundary region, and the other was across North Korea to the boundary region in China and along the tiger national park in northern China. A series of protected areas in North Korea, China, and Russia may support the dispersal of water deer. The establishment of a Northeast Asia landscape conservation network would help establish monitoring and conservation planning at a broad scale, and this study provides an example for the need for such a network",

    "preprint_abstract": "Phylogenetic profiling in eukaryotes is of continued interest to study and predict the functional relationships between proteins. This interest is likely driven by the increased number of available diverse genomes and computational methods to infer orthologies. The evaluation of phylogenetic profiles has mainly focussed on reference genome selection in prokaryotes. However, it has been proven to be challenging to obtain high prediction accuracies in eukaryotes. As part of our recent comparison of orthology inference methods for eukaryotic genomes, we observed a surprisingly high performance for predicting interacting orthologous groups. This high performance, in turn, prompted the question of what factors influence the success of phylogenetic profiling when applied to eukaryotic genomes.\n\nHere we analyse the effect of species, orthologous group and interactome selection on protein interaction prediction using phylogenetic profiles. We select species based on the diversity and quality of the genomes and compare this supervised selection with randomly generated genome subsets. We also analyse the effect on the performance of orthologous groups defined to be in the last eukaryotic common ancestor of eukaryotes to that of orthologous groups that are not. Finally, we consider the effects of reference interactome set filtering and reference interactome species.\n\nIn agreement with other studies, we find an effect of genome selection based on quality, less of an effect based on genome diversity, but a more notable effect based on the amount of information contained within the genomes. Most importantly, we find it is not merely selecting the correct genomes that is important for high prediction performance. Other choices in meta parameters such as orthologous group selection, the reference species of the interaction set, and the quality of the interaction set have a much larger impact on the performance when predicting protein interactions using phylogenetic profiles. These findings shed light on the differences in reported performance amongst phylogenetic profiles approaches, and reveal on a more fundamental level for which types of protein interactions this method has most promise when applied to eukaryotes.",

One hundred and one (101) samples were collected and microbial quality were assessed by evaluating the food hygiene indicators such as total aerobic mesophilic flora, total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, yeast and mould. Food safety indicators such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were checked too. All samples were analyzed under ISO methods.\n\nThe results showed that 73.27% of samples were satisfactory while 14.85% were acceptable and 11.88% were not satisfactory according to international standards. Among the food safety indicators sought, Escherichia coli was detected in two samples and Bacillus cereus in four samples. Most of the analyzed food exhibited good hygiene behavior within the acceptable limits and the highest of not satisfactory rate was observed in milk powder and rice with sauce. Ouagadougou samples record the highest number of not satisfactory samples.\n\nDespite the general quality was satisfactory, the presence of specific microorganisms such as coliforms is indicative of the poor hygiene surrounded these foods. It is therefore necessary to train and follow up the vendors in the handling of equipment, hand-washing practices and selling environment hygiene for better improvement of the quality of the street foods.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\n\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.",

Brain connectivity follows predictable organizational principles: at the cellular level, larger supragranular pyramidal neurons have larger dendritic trees, more synapses, more complex branching and perform more complex neuronal computations; at the macro-scale, region-to-region connections are suggested to display a diverse architecture with highly connected hub-areas facilitating complex information integration and computation. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the branching structure of large-scale region-to-region connectivity follows similar organizational principles as known for the neuronal scale. We examine microscale connectivity of basal dendritic trees of supragranular pyramidal neurons (300+) across ten cortical areas in five human donor brains (1M/4F). Dendritic complexity was quantified as the number of branch points, tree length, spine count, spine density and overall branching complexity. High-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI was used to construct  white matter trees of cortico-cortical wiring. Examining the complexity of the resulting white matter trees using the same measures as for dendritic trees shows multimodal association areas to have larger, more complexly branched white matter trees than primary areas (all p<0.0001) and regional macroscale complexity to run in parallel with microscale measures, in terms of number of inputs (r=0.677, p=0.032), branch points (r=0.790, p=0.006), total tree length (r=0.664, p=0.036) and branching complexity (r=0.724, p=0.018). Our findings support the integrative theory that brain connectivity is structured following similar  principles of connectivity at the neuronal and macroscale level, and provide a framework to study connectivity changes in brain conditions at multiple levels of brain organization.",

ISGs antagonize viral pathogens directly through diverse mechanisms acting at different stages of viral life cycles, and indirectly by modulating cell cycle and promoting programmed cell death. The mechanisms of action and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable the high throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating the potentially confounding effects of endogenous IFN and potential antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG induction in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to IFN. Engineered CRISPRa cell lines demonstrated inducible, robust, and specific gRNA-directed expression of ISGs, which are functional in restricting viral infection. Using this platform, we screened for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 as well as multiple novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of candidate hits by complementary targeted CRISPRa and ectopic cDNA expression infection experiments, which, among other hits, confirmed OAS1 as a SARS-CoV-2 restriction factor. OAS1 exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, and these effects required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a robust, high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by the identification of multiple novel SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.",

Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of the human inner kinetochore CCAN (Constitutive Centromere Associated Network) complex bound to CENP-ANuc reconstituted onto -satellite DNA. CCAN forms edge-on contacts with CENP-ANuc, while a linker DNA segment of the -satellite repeat emerges from the fully-wrapped end of the nucleosome to thread through the central CENP-LN channel which tightly grips the DNA. The CENP-TWSX histone-fold module, together with CENP-HIKHead, further augments DNA binding and partially wraps the linker DNA in a manner reminiscent of canonical nucleosomes. Our study suggests that the topological entrapment of the -satellite repeat linker DNA by CCAN provides a robust mechanism by which the kinetochore withstands the pushing and pulling of centromeres associated with chromosome congression and segregation forces.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe human inner kinetochore CCAN complex tightly grips the linker DNA of the -satellite CENP-A nucleosome.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Inter-brain synchronization is enhanced when individuals perform rhythmic interpersonal coordination tasks, such as playing instruments in music ensembles. Experimentally, synchronization has been shown to correlate with the performance of joint tapping tasks. However, it is unclear whether inter-brain synchronization is related to the stability of interpersonal coordination represented as the standard deviation of relative phase (SDRP). In this study, we simultaneously recorded electroencephalograms of two paired individuals during anti-phase tapping in three speed conditions: slow (reference inter-tap interval [ITI]: 0.5 s), fast (reference ITI: 0.25 s), and free (preferred ITI). We calculated the inter-brain synchronization within six regions of interest: frontal, central, left/right temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. We found that synchronization of the central-temporal regions was positively correlated with SDRP in the theta and alpha bands, while synchronization of the frontal-frontal and frontal-central was positively correlated with SDRP in the beta band. These results demonstrate that inter-brain synchronization occurs only when task requirements are high, and that it increases with the instability of the coordination. This may be explained by the stronger mutual prediction required in unstable coordination than that in stable coordination, which increases inter-brain synchronization.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose diagnosis relies on deficient social interaction and communication together with repetitive behavior. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved that ameliorates social behavior in patients with ASD. Based on the excitation/inhibition imbalance theory of autism, we hypothesized that bromide ions, long used as an antiepileptic medication, could relieve core symptoms of ASD. We evaluated the effects of chronic sodium bromide (NaBr) administration on autistic-like symptoms in three genetic mouse models of autism: Oprm1-/- , Fmr1-/- and Shank3{Delta}ex13-16-/- mice. We showed that chronic NaBr treatment relieved autistic-like behaviors in these three models. In Oprm1-/- mice, these beneficial effects were superior to those of chronic bumetanide administration. At transcriptional level, chronic NaBr in Oprm1 null mice was associated with increased expression of genes coding for chloride ions transporters, GABAA receptor subunits, oxytocin and mGlu4 receptor. Lastly, we uncovered synergistic alleviating effects of chronic NaBr and a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGlu4 receptor on autistic-like behavior in Oprm1-/- mice. We evidenced in heterologous cells that bromide ions behave as PAMs of mGlu4, providing a molecular mechanism for such synergy. Our data reveal the therapeutic potential of bromide ions, alone or in combination with a PAM of mGlu4 receptor, for the treatment of ASDs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating the three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated interactions and topologically associating domains (TADs)1-4. However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. To address this question we use a novel assay to position an enhancer at a large number of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. Quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveal that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a non-linear relationship. Mathematical modeling and validation against experimental data further provide evidence that nonlinearity arises from transient enhancer-promoter interactions being memorized into longer-lived promoter states in individual cells, thus uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism for how enhancers control transcription across large genomic distances despite rarely meeting their target promoters, and for how TAD boundaries can block distal enhancers. We finally show that enhancer strength additionally determines not only absolute transcription levels, but also the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated functional insulation. Our unbiased, systematic and quantitative measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation.",

Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species and on long-standing hypotheses regarding the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found somatic mutagenesis to be dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Remarkably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied displaying a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species surveyed, including [~]30-fold variation in lifespan and [~]40,000-fold variation in body mass, the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of [~]3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a contributing factor in ageing.",

Sleep index (0 [worst]-6 [best]) of each participant was retrieved from six sleep behaviors: snoring, chronotype, daytime sleepiness, sleep duration, insomnia, and difficulties in getting up. Two BAs, the KDM-biological age and PhenoAge, were estimated by corresponding algorithms based on clinical traits, and their discrepancies with chronological age were defined as the age accelerations (AAs).\n\nResultsWe first observed negative associations between the sleep index and the two AAs, and demonstrated that the change of AAs could be the consequence of sleep quality using Mendelian randomization with genetic risk scores of sleep index and BAs. Particularly, one unit increase in sleep index was associated with 0.105- and 0.125-year decreases in KDM-biological age acceleration and PhenoAge acceleration, respectively. Furthermore, we observed significant independent and joint effects of sleep and air pollution (i.e. PM2.5 and NO2), another key driver of aging, on BAs. Sleep quality also showed modifying effect on the associations of elevated PM2.5 and NO2 levels with accelerated aging. For instance, an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 level was associated with 0.011-, 0.047-, and 0.078-year increase in PhenoAge acceleration among people with high (5-6), medium (3-4), and low (0-2) sleep index, respectively.\n\nConclusionsOur findings elucidate that better sleep quality could lessen accelerated biological aging resulting from exogenous exposures including air pollution.\n\nFundingPeking University Start-up Grant (BMU2021YJ044)",

    "preprint_abstract": "Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) produces alcohol dependence, facilitates anxiety-like behavior, and increases post-CIE alcohol intake. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is one of several brain regions that regulates anxiety-like behavior and alcohol intake through downstream projections. The BLA receives information from two distinct input pathways. Afferents from medial structures like the thalamus and prefrontal cortex enter the BLA through the stria terminalis whereas lateral cortical structures like the anterior insula cortex enter the BLA through the external capsule. CIE induces input- and sex-specific adaptations to glutamatergic function in the BLA. Previous studies sampled neurons throughout the BLA, but did not distinguish between projection-specific populations. The current study investigated BLA neurons that project to the NAC (BLA-NAC neurons) or the BNST (BLA-BNST neurons) as representative  reward and  aversion BLA neurons, and showed that CIE alters glutamatergic function and excitability in a projection- and sex-specific manner. CIE increases glutamate release from stria terminalis inputs only onto BLA-BNST neurons. At external capsule synapses, CIE increases postsynaptic glutamatergic function in male BLA-NAC neurons and female BLA-BNST neurons. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that CIE enhanced the excitability of male BLA-NAC neurons and BLA-BNST neurons in both sexes when glutamatergic but not GABAergic function was intact. Thus, CIE-mediated increased glutamatergic function facilitates hyperexcitability in male BLA-NAC neurons and BLA-BNST neurons of both sexes.",

However, the motivation of courtship behavior remains unexplored. We first find the phenomenon that courtship behavior is modulated by motivational state. A male fly courts another male fly when it first courts a decapitated female fly however, male- male courtship behavior rarely occurs under normal conditions. Male flies that have satisfied the need for sexual behavior show a decreased male-female sex drive. Therefore, in this phenomenon, the male flys courtship motivational state is induced by its exposure to female flies. Blocking dopaminergic neurons by expressing TNTe decreases motivational state-induced male-male courtship behavior without affecting male-female courtship behavior. Vision cues are another key component in sexually driven male-female courtship behavior. Here, we identify a base theory that the inner motivational state could eventually decide fly behavior.",

A major challenge is to measure within- and across-layer information in actively behaving animals, in particular in mice that have become a major species in neuroscience due to an extensive genetic toolkit. Here we describe the Hybrid Drive, a new chronic implant for mice that combines tetrode arrays to record within-layer information with silicon probes to simultaneously measure across-layer information. The design of our device combines up to 14 tetrodes and 2 silicon probes, that can be arranged in custom arrays to generate unique areas-specific (and multi-area) layouts. We show that large numbers of neurons and layer-resolved local field potentials can be recorded from the same brain region across weeks without loss in electrophysiological signal quality. The drives lightweight structure ({approx} 3.5 g) leaves animal behavior largely unchanged during a variety of experimental paradigms. We demonstrate how the data collected with the Hybrid Drive allow state-of-the-art analysis in a series of experiments linking the spiking activity of CA1 pyramidal layer neurons to the oscillatory activity across hippocampal layers. Our new device fits a gap in the existing technology and increases the range and precision of questions that can be addressed about neural computations in freely behaving mice.",

Although previous studies focused on the role of neuronal deficits in the memory phenotypes of rodent models of TSC, the results presented here demonstrate a role for microglia in these deficits. Mice with a heterozygous null mutation of the Tsc2 gene (Tsc2+/-), show deficits in hippocampal dependent tasks, as well as abnormal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region. Here, we show that microglia and type I interferon signaling (IFN1) have a key role in the object place recognition (OPR; a hippocampal dependent task) deficits and abnormal LTP of Tsc2+/- male mice. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that male, but not female, Tsc2+/- mice showed OPR deficits. Importantly, these deficits can be rescued by depletion of microglia, as well as by a genetic manipulation of a signaling pathway known to modulate microglia function (interferon-alpha/beta receptor alpha chain null mutation). In addition to rescuing the OPR deficits, depletion of microglia also reversed the abnormal LTP of the Tsc2+/- mice. Altogether, our results suggest that altered IFN1 signaling in microglia cause the abnormal LTP and OPR deficits of male Tsc2+/- mice.",

Among these compounds, BDSF is a structural analog of DSF that is commonly detected in bacterial species (e.g., Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia). Additionally, BDSF contributes to the interkingdom communication regulating fungal life stage transitions. How BDSF is sensed in Xanthomonas spp. and the functional diversity between BDSF and DSF remain unclear. In this study, we generated genetic and biochemical evidence that BDSF is a low-active regulator of X. campestris pv. campestris quorum sensing, whereas trans-BDSF seems not a signaling compound. BDSF is detected by the sensor histidine kinase RpfC. Although BDSF has relatively low physiological activities, it binds to the RpfC sensor with a high affinity and activates RpfC autophosphorylation to a level that is similar to that induced by DSF in vitro. The inconsistency in the physiological and biochemical activities of BDSF is not due to RpfC- RpfG phosphorylation or RpfG hydrolase. Neither BDSF nor DSF controls the phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities of RpfC or the ability of RpfG hydrolase to degrade the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP. We demonstrated that BDSF is prone to degradation by RpfB, a critical fatty acyl-CoA ligase involved in the turnover of DSF-family signals. rpfB mutations lead to substantial increases in BDSF-induced quorum sensing. Although DSF and BDSF are similarly detected by RpfC, our data suggest that their differential degradation in cells is the major factor responsible for the diversity in their physiological effects.\n\nIMPORTANCEDiffusible signal factor (DSF) family are quorum-sensing signals employed by gram-negative bacteria. These signals are a group of cis-2-unsaturated fatty acids, such as DSF, BDSF, IDSF, CDSF, and SDSF. However, the functional divergence of various DSF signals remains unclear. The present study demonstrates that though BDSF is a low active quorum-sensing signal than that of DSF, it binds histidine kinase RpfC with a higher affinity and activates RpfC autophosphorylation to the similar level as DSF. Rather than regulation of enzymatic activities of RpfC and its cognate response regulator RpfG encoding a c-di-GMP hydrolase, BDSF is prone to degradation in bacterial cells by RpfB, which effectively avoided the inhibition of bacterial growth by accumulating high concentration of BDSF. Therefore, our study shed new light on the functional difference of quorum-sensing signals and revealed that bacteria balance quorum-sensing and growth by fine-turning concentration of signaling chemical.",

Immune dysfunction includes insufficient immune lesion clearance, a pro-inflammatory endometrial environment, and systemic inflammation. Comprehensive understanding of endometriosis immune pathophysiology in different hormonal milieu and disease severity has been hampered by limited direct characterization of immune populations in endometrium, blood, and lesions. Simultaneous deep phenotyping at single cell resolution of complex tissues has transformed our understanding of the immune system and its role in many diseases. Herein, we report mass cytometry and high dimensional analyses to study immune cell phenotypes, abundance, activation states, and functions in endometrium and blood of women with and without endometriosis in different cycle phases and disease stages.\n\nMethodsA case-control study was designed. Endometrial biopsies and blood (n=60 total) were obtained from women with (n=20, n=17, respectively) and without (n=14, n=9) endometriosis in the proliferative and secretory cycle phases of the menstrual cycle. Two mass cytometry panels were designed; one broad panel and one specific for mononuclear phagocytic cells (MPC), and all samples were multiplexed to characterize both endometrium and blood immune composition at unprecedented resolution. We combined supervised and unsupervised analyses to finely define the immune cell subsets with an emphasis on MPC. Then, association between cell types, protein expression, disease status, and cycle phase were performed.\n\nResultsThe broad panel highlighted a significant modification of MPC in endometriosis; thus, they were studied in detail with an MPC-focused panel. Endometrial CD91+ macrophages overexpressed SIRP (phagocytosis inhibitor) and CD64 (associated with inflammation) in endometriosis, and they were more abundant in mild versus severe disease. In blood, classical and intermediate monocytes were less abundant in endometriosis, whereas plasmacytoid dendritic cells and non-classical monocytes were more abundant. Non-classical monocytes were higher in severe versus mild disease.\n\nConclusionsA greater inflammatory phenotype and decreased phagocytic capacity of endometrial macrophages in endometriosis are consistent with defective clearance of endometrial cells shed during menses and in tissue homeostasis, with implications in endometriosis pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Different proportions of monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in blood from endometriosis suggest systemically aberrant functionality of the myeloid system opening new venues for the study of biomarkers and therapies for endometriosis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Therapeutic success of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based therapies critically depends on immunological compatibility of the hiPSC-derived transplant. As grafted hiPSC-derived cells are often immature, we hypothesized that their immunologic properties may change due to post-grafting maturation. Subsequently, this will affect their interaction with the host immune system and may compromise graft tolerance. In the present study allogeneic and autologous cellular immunity of primary cells, therof reprogrammed hiPSC, hiPSC-derived progenitor and terminally differentiated cells was investigated in vitro by using renal cells as a model system. In contrast to allogeneic primary cells, hiPSC-derived early renal progenitors and mature renal epithelial cells were both tolerated not only by autologous but also by allogeneic T cells. These immune-privileged properties resulted from active immune-modulation and low immune visibility, which declined during the process of cell maturation. However, autologous and allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell responses were not suppressed by hiPSC-derived renal cells and efficiently changed NK cell activation status. These findings clearly show a dynamic stage-specific dependency of autologous and allogeneic T- and NK cell responses to the hiPSC-derived renal cell lineage with consequences for effective cell therapies. The study suggests that hiPSC-derived early progenitors may provide advantageous immune suppressive properties when applied in cell therapy. The data furthermore indicate a need to suppress NK cell activation in allogeneic as well as autologous settings.",

The diffusion MRI protocol for the Human Connectome Project (HCP) has been developed and optimized to obtain high-quality, high-resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets. However, such efforts have not been fully explored in preclinical studies, especially for rodents. In this study, high quality dMRI datasets of mouse brains were acquired at 9.4T system from two vendors. In particular, we acquired a high-spatial resolution dMRI dataset (25 m isotropic with 126 diffusion encoding directions), which we believe to be the highest spatial resolution yet obtained; and a high-angular resolution dMRI dataset (50 m isotropic with 384 diffusion encoding directions), which we believe to be the highest angular resolution compared to the dMRI datasets at the microscopic resolution. We systematically investigated the effects of three important parameters that affect the final outcome of the connectome: b value (1000 s/mm2 to 8000 s/mm2), angular resolution (10 to 126), and spatial resolution (25 {micro}m to 200 {micro}m). The stability of tractography and connectome increase with the angular resolution, where more than 50 angles are necessary to achieve consistent results. The connectome and quantitative parameters derived from graph theory exhibit a linear relationship to the b value (R2 > 0.99); a single-shell acquisition with b value of 3000 s/mm2 shows comparable results to the multi-shell high angular resolution dataset. The dice coefficient decreases and both false positive rate and false negative rate gradually increase with coarser spatial resolution. Our study provides guidelines and foundations for exploration of tradeoffs among acquisition parameters for the structural connectome in ex vivo mouse brain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "During the development of the male germline, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) originate from gonocytes that differentiate from primordial germ cells (PGCs). In the developing and regenerating mouse testis, expression of the gene LIM homeobox 1 (Lhx1) marks the most undifferentiated SSCs. However, an enrichment of Lhx1 expression in spermatogonia-like cells generated in vitro has not been reported so far. Previously, it was shown that a chemical intervention in male mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in serum culture, including a timed combination of the SIRT1 inhibitor Ex-527, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG-108 and the electrophilic redox cycling compound tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), was associated with molecular markers of the PGC to gonocyte differentiation process. Here, we report the in vitro differentiation of male mouse ES cells, cultured under dual chemical inhibition of GSK3{beta} and MEK (termed 2i) with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (termed 2iL) and serum, into cells with spermatogonia-like morphology (CSMs) and population-averaged expression of spermatogonia-specific genes. This was achieved by the removal of 2iL and a specific schedule of 2 partial medium replacements per day with alternating 8-hour and 16-hour intervals over a period of 32 days. Combination of this new cell culture protocol with the previously reported chemical intervention in ES cells changed the population-averaged expression of spermatogonia- and gonocyte-specific genes during the differentiation process and increased the population-averaged gene expression of Lhx1 in the resulting CSMs compared to CSMs without chemical intervention. Furthermore, we detected single CSMs with a strong nuclear LHX1/5 protein signal only in the chemical intervention group. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for the generation of CSMs with an enrichment of Lhx1 expression in vitro. We propose that further investigation of the CSMs generated with this in vitro system may provide new insights into male germline and stem cell development.",

Recent studies have shown the importance of the throat and salivary glands as sites of virus replication and transmission. The viral host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is broadly enriched in epithelial cells of the salivary glands and oral mucosae. Oral care products containing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) as a bactericidal ingredient are known to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. However, the exact mechanism of action remains unknown.\n\nMethodsThis study examined the antiviral activity of CPC against SARS-CoV-2 and its inhibitory effect on the interaction between the viral spike (S) protein and ACE2 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nResultsCPC (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.3%) effectively inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within the contact times (20 and 60 s) in directions for use of oral care products in vitro. The binding ability of both the S protein and ACE2 were reduced by CPC.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that CPC inhibits the interaction between S protein and ACE2, and thus, reduces infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and suppresses viral adsorption.",

The gut microbiota are increasingly recognized as important contributors to obesity and cardiometabolic health. This study aimed to characterize oral and gut microbial communities, and evaluate host:microbiota interactions between clinical obesity classifications. We performed 16S rDNA sequencing on fecal and salivary samples, global metabolomics profiling on plasma and stool samples, and dietary profiling in 135 healthy individuals. We grouped individuals by obesity status, based on body mass index (BMI), including lean (BMI 18-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI [&ge;]30). We analyzed differences in microbiome composition, community inter-relationships, and predicted microbial function by obesity status. We found that salivary bacterial communities of lean and obese individuals were compositionally and phylogenetically distinct. An increase in obesity status was positively associated with strong correlations between bacterial taxa, particularly with bacterial groups implicated in metabolic disorders including Fretibacterium, and Tannerella. Consumption of sweeteners, especially xylitol, significantly influenced compositional and phylogenetic diversities of salivary and fecal bacterial communities. In addition, obesity groups exhibited differences in predicted bacterial metabolic activity, which was correlated with hosts metabolite concentrations. Overall, obesity was associated with distinct changes in bacterial community dynamics, particularly in saliva. Consideration of microbiome community structure, and inclusion of salivary samples may improve our ability to understand pathways linking microbiota to obesity and cardiometabolic disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEObesity is a worldwide epidemic that is associated with a wide range of health issues. Microbiota were shown to influence metabolism and obesity development. Our study aimed to evaluate the interactions between obesity, salivary and fecal microbiota, and metabolite concentrations in healthy individuals. The oral bacterial community was more impacted by the obesity status of the host than fecal microbiota. Consistently for oral and fecal microbiota, the number of strong interactions between bacteria increased with the increase in the obesity status. Several predicted microbial metabolic pathways that were shown to be associated with metabolic health were uniquely enriched between obesity groups. In addition, these metabolic pathways were correlated with plasma and stool metabolites. Our results suggest that oral microbiota might better reflect the obesity status of the host than fecal microbiota, and that correlations between microbial taxa are altered during obesity.",

These metabolites attracted our interest due to their low occurrence frequency in a large library of fermentation broth extracts and their consistent presence in biological replicates of the producer strain. The compounds were found to possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity while exhibiting low cytotoxicity. The biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. ID63040 was found to be highly similar to the streptophenazine reference cluster in the MIBiG database, which originates from the marine Streptomyces sp. CNB-091. Compounds 1 and 2 were the main streptophenazine products from Streptomyces sp. ID63040 at all cultivation times, but were not detected in Streptomyces sp. CNB-091. The lack of obvious candidates for cysteinylation in the Streptomyces sp. ID63040 biosynthetic gene cluster suggests that the N-acetyl-cysteine moiety derives from cellular functions, most likely from mycothiol. Overall, our data represent an interesting example on how to leverage metabolomics for the discovery of new natural products and point out to the often-neglected contribution of house-keeping cellular functions to natural product diversification.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

We know a lot about the role of sensory input in the control of stepping of a single leg. However, the neuronal organization and connectivity of the central neural networks underlying the rhythmic activation and coordination of leg muscles still remain elusive. It is assumed that these networks can couple in the absence of phasic sensory input due to the observation of spontaneous recurrent patterns (SRPs) of coordinated motor activity equivalent to fictive stepping-phase transitions. Here we sought to quantify the phase of motor activity within SRPs in the isolated and interconnected meso- and metathoracic ganglia. We show that SRPs occur not only in the meso-, but also in the metathoracic ganglia of the stick insect, discovering a qualitative difference between them. We construct a network based on neurophysiological data capable of reproducing the measured SRP phases to investigate this difference. By comparing network output to the biological measurements we confirm the plausibility of the architecture and provide a hypothesis to account for these qualitative differences. The neural architecture we present couples individual central pattern generators to reproduce the fictive stepping-phase transitions observed in deafferented stick insect preparations after pharmacological activation, providing insights into the neural architecture underlying coordinated locomotion.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Our understanding of chloride in biology can be accelerated through the application of fluorescent protein-based sensors in living cells. Laboratory-guided evolution can be used to diversify and identify sensors with specific properties. Recently, we established that the fluorescent proton-pumping rhodopsin wtGR from Gloeobacter violaceus can be converted into a fluorescent sensor for chloride. To unlock this non-natural function, a single point mutation at the Schiff counterion position from D121V was introduced into wtGR fused with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) resulting in GR1-CFP. Here, we have integrated coevolutionary analysis with directed evolution to understand how the rhodopsin sequence space can be explored and engineered to improve this starting point. We first show how evolutionary couplings are predictive of functional sites in the rhodopsin family and how a fitness metric based on sequence can be used to quantify known proton-pumping activities of GR-CFP variants. Then, we couple this ability to predict potential functional outcomes with a screening and selection assay in live Escherichia coli to reduce the mutational search space of five residues along the proton-pumping pathway in GR1-CFP. This iterative selection process results in GR2-CFP with four additional mutations, E132K, A84K, T125C, and V245I. Finally, bulk, and single fluorescence measurements in live E. coli reveal that GR2-CFP is a reversible, ratiometric fluorescent sensor for extracellular chloride with an improved dynamic range. We anticipate that our framework will be applicable to other systems, providing a more efficient methodology to engineer fluorescent-protein based sensors with desired properties.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=47 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474067v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ddb801org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15b4a9corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f497corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b19c5b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "Transcriptional repression can occur via various mechanisms, such as blocking, sequestration, and displacement. For instance, the repressors can hold the activators to prevent binding with DNA or can bind to the DNA-bound activators to block their transcriptional activity. Although the transcription can be completely suppressed with a single mechanism, multiple repression mechanisms are utilized together to inhibit transcriptional activators in many systems, such as circadian clocks and NF-{kappa}B oscillators. This raises the question of what advantages arise if seemingly redundant repression mechanisms are combined. Here, by deriving equations describing the multiple repression mechanisms, we find that their combination can synergistically generate a sharply ultrasensitive transcription response and thus strong oscillations. This rationalizes why the multiple repression mechanisms are used together in various biological oscillators. The critical role of such combined transcriptional repression for strong oscillations is further supported by our analysis of formerly identified mutations disrupting the transcriptional repression of the mammalian circadian clock. The hitherto unrecognized source of the ultrasensitivity, the combined transcriptional repressions, can lead to robust synthetic oscillators with a previously unachievable simple design.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma being the most common subtype. Many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are altered in this cancer type and the discovery of oncogene mutations has led to the development of targeted therapies that have improved clinical outcomes. However, a large fraction of lung adenocarcinomas lacks mutations in known oncogenes, and the genesis and treatment of these oncogene-negative tumors remain enigmatic. Here, we perform iterative in vivo functional screens using quantitative autochthonous mouse model systems to uncover the genetic and biochemical changes that enable efficient lung tumor initiation in the absence of oncogene alterations. Through the generation of hundreds of diverse combinations of tumor suppressor alterations, we demonstrate that the inactivation of suppressors of the RAS and PI3K pathways drive the development of oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinoma. Human genomic data and histology identified RAS/MAPK and PI3K pathway activation as a common event in oncogene- negative human lung adenocarcinomas. We demonstrate that these Onc-negativeRAS/PI3K tumors and related cell lines are vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of these signaling axes. These results transform our understanding of this prevalent yet understudied subtype of lung adenocarcinoma.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Computational tools have been widely adopted for strain optimisation in metabolic engineering, contributing to numerous success stories of producing industrially relevant biochemicals. However, most of these tools focus on single metabolic intervention strategies (either gene/reaction knockout or amplification alone) and rely on hypothetical optimality principles (e.g., maximisation of growth) and precise gene expression (e.g., fold changes) for phenotype prediction. This paper introduces OptDesign, a new two-step strain design strategy. In the first step, OptDesign selects regulation candidates that have a noticeable flux difference between the wild type and production strains. In the second step, it computes optimal design strategies with limited manipulations (combining regulation and knockout) leading to high biochemical production. The usefulness and capabilities of OptDesign are demonstrated for the production of three biochemicals in E. coli using the latest genome-scale metabolic model iML1515, showing highly consistent results with previous studies while suggesting new manipulations to boost strain performance.

    "preprint_abstract": "The ability of trypanosome parasites to survive and sustain infections is dependent on diverse and intricate immune evasion mechanisms. Pathogenic trypanosomes often have broad host niches that preclude identification of host specific adaptations. In contrast, some non-pathogenic species of the genus Trypanosoma have highly specific hosts and vectors. Trypanosoma theileri, a non-pathogenic parasite of bovines, has a predicted surface protein architecture that likely aids survival in its mammalian host, distinct from the dominant variant surface glycoprotein coat of pathogenic African trypanosomes. In both species, their surface proteins are encoded by genes which account for [~]10% of their genome. A non-pathogenic parasite of sheep, Trypanosoma melophagium, is transmitted by the sheep ked and is closely related to T. theileri. To explore host and vector specificity between these closely related species, we sequenced the T. melophagium genome and transcriptome and an annotated draft genome was assembled. T. melophagium was compared to 43 kinetoplastid genomes, including T. theileri. T. melophagium and T. theileri have an AT biased genome, the greatest bias of publicly available trypanosomatids. This trend may result from selection acting to decrease the genome nucleotide cost. The T. melophagium genome is 6.3Mb smaller than T. theileri and large families of proteins, characteristic of the predicted surface of T. theileri, were found to be absent or greatly reduced in T. melophagium. Instead, T. melophagium has modestly expanded protein families associated with the avoidance of complement-mediated lysis. The genome of T. melophagium contains core genes required for development, glycolysis, RNA interference, and meiotic exchange, each being shared with T. theileri. Comparisons between T. melophagium and T. theileri provide insight into the specific adaptations of these related trypanosomatids to their distinct mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors.\n\nAuthor summaryNon-pathogenic trypanosomes can have narrow host niches, with closely related trypanosome species expanding into distinct mammalian host and insect vectors. T. theileri, a non-pathogenic trypanosome of bovines, is predicted to have an intricate cell surface which allows it to evade the immune response of its mammalian host. In contrast, T. melophagium is closely related to T. theileri but infects sheep and is transmitted by the sheep ked rather than tabanid flies that transmit T. theileri. Here, we sequence and assemble the T. melophagium genome to identify the genomic basis of host and vector specificity in these non-pathogenic trypanosomes. We confirm the two species are closely related, however, T. melophagium has a smaller genome than T. theileri. Most of the discrepancy in genome size is due to an expansion of putative cell surface genes in T. theileri. The differential investment in cell surface proteins could be due to a focus on adaptation to the mammalian host in T. theileri and the insect host in T. melophagium.\n\nData summaryThe genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes used in this study were accessed from the TriTrypDB repository or NCBI. T. theileri genome sequencing data was downloaded from NCBI SRA (SRR13482812). T. melophagium data generated during this study is available from the NCBI BioProject PRJNA786535.\n\nRepositoriesT. melophagium DNA and RNA sequencing data, along with the draft genome assembly and its annotation, can be found under the NCBI BioProject PRJNA786535.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mutation detection by next generation sequencing (NGS) is routinely used for cancer diagnosis. Selecting an optimal set of genes for a given cancer is not trivial as it has to optimize informativity (i.e. the number of patients with at least one mutation in the panel), while minimizing panel length in order to reduce sequencing costs and increase sensitivity. We propose herein Panel Informativity Optimizer (PIO), an open-source software developed as an R package with a user-friendly graphical interface to help optimize cancer NGS panel informativity. Using patient-level mutational data from either private datasets or preloaded dataset of 91 independent cohort from 31 different cancer type, PIO selects an optimal set of genomic intervals to maximize informativity and panel size in a given cancer type. Different options are offered such as the definition of genomic intervals at the gene or exon level, and the use of optimization strategy at the patient or patient per kilobase level. PIO can also propose an optimal set of genomic intervals to increase informativity of custom panels. A panel tester function is also available for panel benchmarking. Using public databases, as well as data from real-life settings, we demonstrate that PIO allows panel size reduction of up to 1000kb, and accurately predicts the performance of custom or commercial panels. PIO is available online at https://vincentalcazer.shinyapps.io/Panel_informativity_optimizer/ or can be set on a locale machine from https://github.com/VincentAlcazer/PIO.",

It can be detrimental or beneficial, and there is a pressing need to better understand its regulation. The immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 is known as a T helper 2 (Th2) effector molecule, but it is currently unclear whether IL-10 dampens or promotes Th2 differentiation during infection. Here we show that helminth infection in mice elicits IL-10 expression in both the intestinal lamina propria and the draining mesenteric lymph node, with higher expression in the infected tissue. In vitro, exogenous IL-10 enhanced Th2 differentiation in isolated CD4+ T cells, increasing expression of GATA3 and production of IL-5 and IL-13. The ability of IL-10 to amplify the Th2 response coincided with its suppression of IFN{gamma} expression and, in vivo, we found that, in intestinal helminth infection, IL-10 receptor expression was higher on Th1 cells in the small intestine than on Th2 cells in the same tissue, or on any Th cell in the draining lymph node. In vivo blockade of IL-10 signalling during helminth infection resulted in an expansion of IFN{gamma}+ and Tbet+ Th1 cells in the small intestine and caused a coincident decrease in IL-13, IL-5 and GATA3 expression by intestinal T cells. Together our data indicate that IL-10 signalling promotes Th2 differentiation during helminth infection at least in part by regulating competing Th1 cells in the infected tissue.",

Here we systematically dissected PDA intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion by in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screening, and identified Rnf31 and Vps4b as essential factors required for escaping CD8+ T cell-killing. Using murine PDA cells and human PDA organoids, we demonstrate that Rnf31 protects from TNF-mediated caspase 8 cleavage and subsequent apoptosis induction. For Vps4b we found that inactivation impairs autophagy, resulting in increased accumulation of CD8+ T cell-derived granzyme B and subsequent tumor cell lysis. Orthotopic transplantation of Rnf31- or Vps4b deficient pancreatic tumors, moreover, revealed increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and effector function, and markedly reduced tumor growth in mice. Our work uncovers vulnerabilities in PDA that might be exploited to render these tumors more susceptible to the immune system.",

Here, we show that repeated social defeat induces changes in BRG1 nuclear distribution. The inactivation of the Brg1/Smarca4 gene within dopamine-innervated regions or the constitutive inactivation of the Brm/Smarca2 gene leads to resilience to repeated social defeat and decreases the behavioral responses to cocaine without impacting midbrain dopamine neurons activity. Within striatal medium spiny neurons Brg1 gene inactivation reduces the expression of stress- and cocaine-induced immediate early genes, increases levels of heterochromatin and at a global scale decreases chromatin accessibility. Altogether these data demonstrate the pivotal function of SWI/SNF complexes in behavioral and transcriptional adaptations to salient environmental challenges.",

Here we show that Cas9 sharply bends and undertwists DNA at each PAM, thereby flipping DNA nucleotides out of the duplex and toward the guide RNA for sequence interrogation. Cryo-electron-microscopy (EM) structures of Cas9:RNA:DNA complexes trapped at different states of the interrogation pathway, together with solution conformational probing, reveal that global protein rearrangement accompanies formation of an unstacked DNA hinge. Bend-induced base flipping explains how Cas9 \"reads\" snippets of DNA to locate target sites within a vast excess of non-target DNA, a process crucial to both bacterial antiviral immunity and genome editing. This mechanism establishes a physical solution to the problem of complementarity-guided DNA search and shows how interrogation speed and local DNA geometry may influence genome editing efficiency.",

From there, we sought to determine whether the datasets across multiple species could be used together to carry out comparative functional genomics analyses in plants. To test the idea and as a proof of concept, we created dendrograms of functional relatedness based on terms assigned for all 18 genomes. These dendrograms were compared to well-established species-level evolutionary phylogenies to determine whether trees derived were in agreement with known evolutionary relationships, which they largely are. Where discrepancies were observed, we determined branch support based on jack-knifing then removed individual annotation sets by genome to identify the annotation sets causing unexpected relationships.\n\nConclusionsGOMAP-derived functional annotations used together across multiple species generally retain sufficient biological signal to recover known phylogenetic relationships based on genome-wide functional similarities, indicating that comparative functional genomics across species based on GO data hold promise for generating novel hypotheses about comparative gene function and traits.",

In the light of limited overall resources, it is presently unclear for researchers, practitioners and policymakers which of these topics are stable enough for clinical use in the near future and which topics are still experimental, but worth investing time and effort into. To identify potentially promising applications of AI in pathology, we performed an anonymous online survey of 75 computational pathology domain experts from academia and industry. Participants enrolled in 2021 were queried about their subjective opinion on promising and appealing sub-fields of computational pathology with a focus on solid tumors. The results of this survey indicate that the prediction of treatment response directly from routine pathology slides is regarded as the most promising future application. This item was ranked highest in the overall analysis and in sub-groups by age and professional background. Furthermore, prediction of genetic alterations, gene expression and survival directly from routine pathology images scored consistently high across subgroups. Together, these data demonstrate a possible direction for the development of computational pathology systems in clinical, academic and industrial research in the near future.",

Understanding how the spatial confinement in 3D affects the behavior of the embedded cells is crucial to design and predict ELMs function, regulate and minimize their environmental impact and facilitate their translation into applied materials. This study investigates the growth and metabolic activity of bacteria within an associative hydrogel network (Pluronic-based) with mechanical properties that can be tuned by introducing a variable degree of acrylate crosslinks. Individual bacteria distributed in the hydrogel matrix at low density form functional colonies whose size is controlled by the extent of permanent crosslinks. With increasing stiffness and decreasing plasticity of the matrix, a decrease in colony volumes and an increase in their sphericity is observed. Protein production surprisingly follows a different pattern with higher production yields occurring in networks with intermediate permanent crosslinking degrees. These results demonstrate that, bacterial mechanosensitivity can be used to control and regulate the composition and function of ELMs by thoughtful design of the encapsulating matrix, and by following design criteria with interesting similarities to those developed for 3D culture of mammalian cells.",

Uncovering the molecular fingerprints of distinct stress responses may yield novel biomarkers for different diseases, and potentially identify key signaling pathways important for disease progression. tRNAs and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) comprise one of the most abundant RNA species in cells and have been associated with cellular stress responses. The presence of RNA modifications on tDRs has been an obstacle for accurately identifying tDRs with conventional small RNA sequencing. Here, we use AlkB-facilitated methylation sequencing (ARM-seq) to uncover a comprehensive landscape of cellular and extracellular tDR expression in a variety of human and rat cells during common stress responses, including nutritional deprivation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress. We found that extracellular tDRs have a distinct fragmentation signature with a predominant length of 31-33 nts and a highly specific termination position when compared with intracellular tDRs. Importantly, we found these signatures are better discriminators of different cellular stress responses compared to extracellular miRNAs. Distinct extracellular tDR signatures for each profiled stressor are elucidated in four different types of cells. This distinct extracellular tDR fragmentation pattern is also noted in plasma extracellular RNAs from patients on cardiopulmonary bypass. The observed overlap of these patient tDR signatures with the signatures of nutritional deprivation and oxidative stress in our cellular models provides preliminary in vivo corroboration of our findings and demonstrates the potential to establish novel extracellular tDR biomarkers in human disease models.",

    "preprint_abstract": "1BackgroundMass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data often consist of tens of thousands of mass spectra collected from a sample surface. During the time necessary to perform a single acquisition, it is likely that uncontrollable factors alter the validity of the initial mass calibration of the instrument, resulting in mass errors of magnitude significantly larger than their expected values. This phenomenon has a two-fold detrimental effect: a) it reduces the ability to interpret the results based on the observed signals, b) it can affect the quality of the observed signal spatial distributions.\n\nResultsWe present a post-acquisition computational method capable of reducing the observed mass drift by up to 60 ppm in biological samples, exploiting the presence of typical molecules with a known mass-to-charge ratio. The procedure, tested on time-of-flight (TOF) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry analyzers interfaced to a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) source, improves the molecular annotation quality and the spatial distributions of the detected ions.\n\nConclusionThe presented method represents a robust and accurate tool for performing post-acquisition mass recalibration of DESI-MSI datasets and can help to increase the reliability of the molecular assignment and the data quality.",

An appropriate inflammatory response is vital for combating pathogens, while an excessive or uncontrolled inflammatory response can lead to the development of chronic diseases. Recent studies show that actively transcribed noncoding regions of the genome are emerging as key regulators of biological processes, including inflammation. LincRNA-Cox2 is one such example of an inflammatory inducible long noncoding RNA functioning to control immune response genes. Here using bulk and single cell RNA-seq, in addition to florescence activated cell sorting, we show that lincRNA-Cox2 is most highly expressed in the lung, particularly in alveolar macrophages where it functions to control immune gene expression following acute lung injury. Utilizing a newly generated lincRNA-Cox2 transgenic overexpressing mouse, we show that it can function in trans to control genes including Ccl3, 4 and 5. This work greatly expands our understanding of the role for lincRNA-Cox2 in host defense and sets in place a new layer of regulation in RNA-immune-regulation of genes within the lung.",

We investigated temperature influences on the dynamics of KaiC, a temperature-compensated ATPase in the cyanobacterial circadian clock system, using quasielastic neutron scattering. The frequency of picosecond to sub-nanosecond incoherent local motions in KaiC was accelerated very slightly in a temperature-dependent manner. Our mutation studies revealed that internal motions of KaiC include several contributions of opposing temperature sensitivities. To take advantage of this balancing effect, the motional frequency of local dynamics in KaiC needs to exceed [~]0.3 ps-1. Some of the mutation sites may be in a pathway through which the motional frequency in the C-terminal domain of KaiC is fed back to the active site of ATPase in its N-terminal domain. The temperature-compensating ability at the dynamics level is likely crucial for circadian clock systems, into which the clock proteins are incorporated, to achieve reaction- or even system-level temperature compensation of the oscillation frequency.",

We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing to compare the diversity and abundance of viruses at sampling sites along a single river in New Zealand that differed in human land use impact, ranging from pristine to urban. From this we identified 504 putative virus species, of which 97% were novel. Many of the novel viruses were highly divergent, and likely included a new subfamily within the Parvoviridae. We identified at least 63 virus species that may infect vertebrates - most likely fish and water birds - from the Astroviridae, Birnaviridae, Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae. No putative human viruses were detected. Importantly, we observed differences in the composition of viral communities at sites impacted by human land-use (farming and urban) compared to native forest sites (pristine). At the viral species level, the urban sites had higher diversity (327 virus species) than the farming (n=150) and pristine sites (n=119), and more viruses were shared between the urban and farming sites (n=76) than between the pristine and farming or urban sites (n=24). The two farming sites had a lower viral abundance across all host types, while the pristine sites had a higher abundance of viruses associated with animals, plants and fungi. We also identified viruses linked to agriculture and human impact at the river sampling sites in farming and urban areas that were not present at the native forest sites. Overall, our study shows that human land-use can impact viral communities in rivers, such that further work is needed to reduce the impact of intensive farming and urbanization on water systems.",

Although originally defined as the relationship between predator feeding rates and prey densities, it is now well known that predator functional responses are shaped by a multitude of factors. Unfortunately, how these factors interact with one another remains unclear, as widely used laboratory methods for measuring functional responses are generally logistically constrained to examining a few factors simultaneously. Furthermore, it is also often unclear whether laboratory derived functional responses translate to field conditions.\nC_LIO_LIOur goal was to apply an observational approach for measuring functional responses to understand how sex/stage differences, temperature, and predator interference interact to influence the functional response of zebra jumping spiders on midges under natural conditions.\nC_LIO_LIWe used field feeding surveys of jumping spiders to infer spider functional responses. We applied a Bayesian model averaging approach to estimate differences among sexes and stages of jumping spiders in their feeding rates and their dependencies on midge densities, temperature, and predator interference.\nC_LIO_LIWe find that females exhibit the steepest functional responses on midges, followed by juveniles, and then males, despite males being larger than juveniles. We also find that sexes and stages differ in the temperature dependence of their space clearance (aka attack) rates. We find little evidence of temperature dependence in females, whereas we find some evidence for an increase in space clearance rate at high temperatures in males and juveniles. Interference effects on feeding rates were asymmetric with little effect of interference on male feeding rates, and effects of interference on females and juveniles depending on the stage/sex from which the interference originates.\nC_LIO_LIOur results illustrate the multidimensional nature of functional responses in natural settings and reveal how factors influencing functional responses can interact with one another through behavior and morphology. Further studies investigating the influence of multiple mechanisms on predator functional responses under field conditions will provide an increased understanding of the drivers of predator-prey interaction strengths and their consequences for communities and ecosystems.\nC_LI",

There have been a number of drug molecules repurposed to fight against Sars-CoV-2, however the proofs for the effectiveness of these drug candidates is limited.

Here we investigate how the selectivity of a drug-like small molecule arises from its modulation of a protein disorder-to-order transition. Binding of the compound AM-7209 has been reported to confer order upon an intrinsically disordered  lid region of the oncoprotein MDM2. Calorimetric measurements revealed that truncation of the lid region of MDM2 increases the apparent dissociation constant of AM-7209 250-fold. By contrast, lid truncation has little effect on the binding of the ligand Nutlin-3a. Insights into these differential binding energetics were obtained via a complete thermodynamic analysis that featured adaptive absolute alchemical free energy of binding calculations with enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reveal that in apo MDM2 the ordered lid state is energetically disfavoured. AM-7209, but not Nutlin-3a, shows a significant energetic preference for ordered lid conformations, thus shifting the balance towards ordering of the lid in the AM-7209/MDM2 complex.

While several risk factors, including MYCN amplification and alterations in RAS and p53 pathway genes, have been defined in NB, the clinical outcome is very variable and difficult to predict. Since genes of the mTOR pathway are up-regulated in MYCN-amplified NB, we aimed to define the predictive value of the mTOR substrate-encoding gene eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1) expression in NB patients.\n\nMethodsSeveral independent NB patient cohorts with corresponding mRNA expression data were analyzed for EIF4EBP1 expression. An institutional NB cohort consisting of 69 prospectively collected tumors was employed to immunohistochemically analyze expression of EIF4EBP1-encoded protein (4EBP1). In addition, we performed an in vitro luciferase reporter gene assay with an episomal EIF4EBP1 promoter and genetically modulated MYCN expression in NB cells.\n\nFindingsEIF4EBP1 mRNA expression was positively correlated with MYCN expression and elevated in stage 4 and high-risk NB patients. High EIF4EBP1 mRNA expression was associated with reduced overall and event-free survival in the entire group of NB patients in three cohorts, as well as in stage 4 and high-risk patients. High levels of 4EBP1 were significantly associated with prognostically unfavorable NB histology. Functional analyses in vitro revealed that EIF4EBP1 expression is transcriptionally controlled by MYCN binding to the EIF4EBP1 promoter.\n\nInterpretationHigh EIF4EBP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in NB patients and may serve to stratify patients with high-risk NB.\n\nFundingG.L. was supported by funding from the Elterninitiative Dusseldorf e.V., the Research Commission of the Medical Faculty of Heinrich Heine University, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Grant LE 3751/2-1), and the German Cancer Aid (Grant 70112624). The laboratory of T.G.P.G. is supported by the Barbara und Wilfried Mohr Foundation. BR is supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 1436/19).\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT Evidence before this studyNB represents a particularly heterogeneous cancer entity, with 5-year event-free survival rate ranging from 50% to 98% depending on the patients risk group. While genes of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway were found to be up-regulated in MYCN-amplified NB tumors, their clinical relevance and prognostic value in NB patients remain unclear. In particular, the mTOR substrate-encoding gene EIF4EBP1 was studied in NB by three different groups and high EIF4EBP1 mRNA expression was observed in MYCN-amplified or contradictorily in more favorable stages 1 and 2 patients. Also, EIF4EBP1 was included in a prognostic gene signature for poor overall survival in NB. However, the prognostic value of EIF4EBP1 alone was not determined in NB and the expression of EIF4EBP1 encoded protein, 4EBP1, was not analyzed in NB tumor tissues and not correlated with clinicopathological features such as histological subtypes. Additionally, the transcriptional regulation of the EIF4EBP1 promoter by MYCN was not characterized.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study uncovers the prognostic potential of EIF4EBP1 at the mRNA and protein levels in NB patients. We report that high EIF4EBP1 expression is correlated with poor survival in three independent cohorts and that high 4EBP1 levels is associated with a prognostically unfavorable histological subtype. High EIF4EBP1 expression is also a factor of poor prognosis in stage 4 and high-risk patient groups. Finally, we found that MYCN activates the human EIF4EBP1 promoter through binding at three binding motifs.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceEIF4EBP1 mRNA and 4EBP1 protein expression have prognostic value in NB, especially to stratify patients with advanced and more aggressive NB, such as patients with stage 4 disease and high-risk patients including those with unfavorable histological subtype NB. Enhanced EIF4EBP1 mRNA and 4EBP1 protein expression in NB are driven by direct transcriptional activation of EIF4EBP1 by MYCN.",

For such large-scale data, subsampling is a powerful and often necessary tool for exploratory data analysis.

Therefore, diversity-preserving subsampling is required for fast exploration of cell types in a large-scale dataset. Here we propose scSampler, an algorithm for fast diversity-preserving subsampling of single-cell transcriptomic data.

While a large variety of pairwise measures of similarity or dissimilarity have been developed for comparing trees with no information on internal nodes, very few address the case of inner node-labeled trees. Yet such trees are common; for instance reconciled gene trees have inner nodes labeled with the type of event giving rise to them, typically speciation or duplication. Recently, we proposed a formulation of the Labeled Robinson Foulds edit distance with edge extensions, edge contractions between identically labeled nodes, and node label flips. However, this distance proved difficult to compute, in particular because shortest edit paths can require contracting \"good\" edges, i.e. edges present in the two trees.\n\nResultsHere, we report on a different formulation of the Labeled Robinson Foulds edit distance -- based on node insertion, deletion and label substitution -- which we show can be computed in linear time. The new formulation also maintains other desirable properties: being a metric, reducing to Robinson Foulds for unlabeled trees and maintaining an intuitive interpretation. The new distance is computable for an arbitrary number of label types, thus making it useful for applications involving not only speciations and duplications, but also horizontal gene transfers and further events associated with the internal nodes of the tree. To illustrate the utility of the new distance, we use it to study the impact of taxon sampling on labeled gene tree inference, and conclude that denser taxon sampling yields better trees.",

Recent studies have demonstrated correlated geographic patterns for leaf endophytic community composition and leaf morphology, also coinciding with different levels of water turbidity and nutrient concentrations. Based on these observations, workers have suggested an environmental microbial fingerprint, which may reflect various environmental stress factors seagrasses have experienced, and may add a holobiont level of plasticity to seagrasses, assisting their acclimation to changing environments and through range expansion. However, it is difficult to tease apart environmental effects from host-diversity dependent effects, which have covaried in field studies, although this is required in order to establish that differences in microbial community compositions among sites are driven by environmental conditions rather than by features governed by the host.\n\nResultsIn this study we carried out a mesocosm experiment, in which we studied the effects of warming and nutrient stress on the composition of epiphytic bacterial communities and on some phenological traits. We studied H. stipulacea collected from two different meadows in the Gulf of Aqaba, representing differences in the host and the environment alike. We found that the source site from which seagrasses were collected was the major factor governing seagrass phenology, although heat increased shoot mortality and nutrient loading delayed new shoot emergence. Bacterial diversity, however, mostly depended on the environmental conditions. The most prominent pattern was the increase in Rhodobacteraceae under nutrient stress without heat stress, along with an increase in Microtrichaceae. Together, the two taxa have the potential to maintain nitrate reduction followed by an anammox process, which can together buffer the increase in nutrient concentrations across the leaf surface.\n\nConclusionsOur results thus corroborate the existence of environmental microbial fingerprints, which are independent from the host diversity, and support the notion of a holobiont level plasticity, both important to understand and monitor H. stipulacea ecology under the changing climate.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Multidrug resistant bacteria are one of the most important current threats to public health and a serious problem in hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Most antibiotic resistance genes are acquired via conjugative gene transfer, in a process that is mediated by a protein machinery called the Type 4 Secretion System (T4SS). The core of the T4SS is a multiprotein complex that spans both the cell wall and cellular membrane(s), serving as a channel for macromolecular secretion. Although the majority of multidrug resistant bacteria responsible for HAIs are of Gram-positive origin, with Enterococci being major contributors, mostly Gram-negative T4SSs have been characterized. Here we describe the structure and organisation of PrgL, one of the seven membrane proteins forming the translocation channel of the T4SS encoded by the pCF10 plasmid from Enterococcus faecalis. We present the structure of the C-terminal domain of PrgL, which displays similarity to VirB8 proteins of Gram-negative secretion systems. PrgL forms dimers and higher order oligomers but does not interact strongly with the other T4SS components. In vitro experiments show that the soluble domain alone is enough to drive both dimerization and dodecamerisation, with a dimerization interface that differs from all other known VirB8-like proteins. Our findings provide insight into the molecular building blocks of Gram-positive T4SS, highlighting similarities but also unique features in PrgL compared to other VirB8-like proteins.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Direct modulation of pancreatic endocrine cell activity by autonomic innervation has been debated. To resolve this question, we established an in vivo imaging model which also allows chronic and acute neuromodulation. Starting at a stage when zebrafish islet architecture is reminiscent of that in adult rodents, we imaged calcium dynamics simultaneously in multiple islet cell types. We first find that activity coupling between beta cells increases upon glucose exposure. Surprisingly, glucose exposure also increases alpha-alpha, alpha-beta and beta-delta coordination. We further show that both chronic and acute loss of nerve activity diminish activity coupling, as observed upon gap junction depletion. Notably, chronic loss of innervation severely disrupts delta cell activity, suggesting that delta cells receive innervation which coordinates its output. Overall, these data show that innervation plays a vital role in the establishment and maintenance of homotypic and heterotypic cellular connectivity in pancreatic islets, a process critical for islet function.",

In the genus Ogataea, most research is focused on three basic O. polymorpha strains--CBS4732, NCYC495, and DL-1. However, the relationship between CBS4732, NCYC495, and DL-1 remains unclear, as the genomic differences between them have not be exactly determined without their high-quality complete genomes. As a nutritionally deficient mutant derived from CBS4732, the O. polymorpha strain CBS4732 ura3{Delta} (named HU-11) is being used for high-yield production of several important proteins or peptides. HU-11 has the same reference genome as CBS4732 (noted as HU-11/CBS4732), because the only genomic difference between them is a 5-bp insertion.\n\nResultsIn the present study, we have assembled the full-length genome of O. polymorpha HU-11/CBS4732 using high-depth PacBio and Illumina data. Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, rDNA, 5 and 3 telomeric, subtelomeric, low complexity and other repeat regions were curated to improve the genome quality. Particularly, we detected large duplicated segments (LDSs) in the subtelomeric regions and exactly determined all the structural variations (SVs) between CBS4732 and NCYC495.\n\nNew findings mainly include(1) the genomic differences between HU-11/CBS4732 and NCYC495 include single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions and deletions, and only three SVs; (2) six genes were incorporated into CBS4732 from Cyberlindnera jadinii by horizontal gene transfer and may bring HU-11/CBS4732 new biological functions or physiological properties; (3) many recombination events may have occurred on chromosome 4 and 5 of CBS4732 and NCYC495 ancestors and two large segments were acquired by CBS4732 and NCYC495 from chromosome 6 and C. jadinii during recombination, respectively; and (4) the genome expansion in methylotrophic yeasts is mainly driven by large segment duplication in subtelomeric regions.\n\nConclusionsThe present study preliminarily revealed the complex relationship between CBS4732, NCYC495, and DL-1. The new findings provide new opportunities for in-depth understanding of genome evolution in methylotrophic yeasts and lay the foundations for the industrial applications of O. polymorpha CBS4732, NCYC495, DL-1, and their derivative strains. The full-length genome of the O. polymorpha strain HU-11/CBS4732 should be included into the NCBI RefSeq database for future studies of Ogataea spp..",

The recent development and optimizations of base editors, rubber and pencil genome editing tools now promise to enable direct functional assessment of SNVs in model organisms. However, the lack of bioinformatic tools aiding target prediction limits the application of base editing in vivo. Here, we provide a framework for adenine and cytosine base editing in medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio), ideal for scalable validation studies. We developed an online base editing tool ACEofBASEs (a careful evaluation of base-edits), to facilitate decision-making by streamlining sgRNA design and performing off-target evaluation. We used state-of-the-art adenine (ABE) and cytosine base editors (CBE) in medaka and zebrafish to edit eye pigmentation genes and transgenic GFP function with high efficiencies. Base editing in the genes encoding troponin T and the potassium channel ERG faithfully recreated known cardiac phenotypes. We finally validated missense mutations in novel candidate genes of congenital heart disease (CHD) dapk3, ube2b, usp44, and ptpn11 and present the resulting heart specific phenotypes. This base editing framework applies to a wide range of SNV-susceptible traits accessible in fish, facilitating straight-forward candidate validation and prioritization for detailed mechanistic downstream studies.",

However the precise mechanisms coordinating these processes remain poorly understood. We previously identified the estrogen-related receptor  (ERR) as a major regulator of cell migration. Here, we show that loss of ERR leads to abnormal accumulation of actin filaments that is associated with an increase in the level of inactive form of the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin. We further show that ERR depletion decreases cell adhesion and promotes defective FA formation and turnover. Interestingly, specific inhibition of the RhoA-ROCK-LIMK-cofilin pathway rescues the actin polymerization defects resulting from ERR silencing, but not cell adhesion. Instead we found that MAP4K4 is a direct target of ERR and down-regulation of its activity rescues cell adhesion and FA formation in the ERR-depleted cells. Altogether, our results highlight a crucial role of ERR in coordinating the dynamic of actin network and focal adhesion through the independent regulation of the RhoA and MAP4K4 pathways.",

However, it is unclear if each type of cargo is matched with a specific subset of LDs. Is the identity of each subset rigidly maintained? Here, we report that SEIP-1/seipin defines a subset of oocyte LDs that are required for proper eggshell formation in C. elegans. Using a photoconvertible fluorescent protein-based imaging assay, we found that SEIP-1 positive LDs were selectively depleted after fertilization, coincident of the formation of a lipid-rich permeability barrier of the eggshell. Loss of SEIP-1 function caused impenetrant embryonic arrest, which could be suppressed by depleting a LD-structural protein PLIN-1/perilipin. The embryonic development of seip-1; plin-1 mutant in turn depended on another LD-associated protein, RAB-18/Rab18. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that SEIP-1 dependent and independent mechanisms act redundantly to ensure the packaging and export of lipid-rich permeability barrier constituents via LDs. The identity of these LDs, as defined by their associated proteins, exhibits unexpected plasticity that ultimately ensures the survival of embryos ex utero.",

In efforts to generate novel vaccination strategies, notably against cancer, human cDC1s emerge as an ideal target to deliver antigens. cDC1s uniquely express XCR1, a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Due to its restricted expression and endocytic nature, XCR1 represents an attractive receptor to mediate antigen-delivery to human cDC1s. To explore tumor antigen delivery to human cDC1s, we used an engineered version of XCR1-binding lymphotactin (XCL1), XCL1(CC3). Site-specific sortase-mediated transpeptidation was performed to conjugate XCL1(CC3) to an analog of the HLA-A*02:01 epitope of the cancer testis antigen New York Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO-1). While poor epitope solubility prevented isolation of stable XCL1-antigen conjugates, incorporation of a single polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain upstream of the epitope-containing peptide enabled generation of soluble XCL1(CC3)-antigen fusion constructs. Binding and chemotactic characteristics of the XCL1-antigen conjugate, as well as its ability to induce antigen-specific CD8+ T cell activation by cDC1s, was assessed. PEGylated XCL1(CC3)-antigen conjugates retained binding to XCR1, and induced cDC1 chemoattraction in vitro. The model epitope was efficiently cross-presented by human cDC1s to activate NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T cells. Importantly, vaccine activity was increased by targeting XCR1 at the surface of cDC1s. Our results present a novel strategy for the generation of targeted vaccines fused to insoluble antigens. Moreover, our data emphasize the potential of targeting XCR1 at the surface of primary human cDC1s to induce potent CD8+ T cell responses.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Upon intracellular recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I-like proteins interact with MAVS at peroxisomes and mitochondria, inducing its oligomerization and the downstream production of direct antiviral effectors. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is able to specifically evade this antiviral response, via its antiapoptotic protein vMIA. Besides suppressing the programmed cell death of infected cells, vMIA inhibits the antiviral signalling at mitochondria by inducing the organelles fragmentation, consequently hindering the interaction between MAVS and the endoplasmic reticulum protein STING. Here, we demonstrate that vMIA interferes with the peroxisomal antiviral signalling via a distinct mechanism that is independent of the organelles morphology and does not affect STING. vMIA interacts with MAVS at peroxisomes and inhibits its oligomerization, restraining downstream signalling, in an MFF-dependent manner. This study also demonstrates that vMIA is totally dependent on the organelles fission machinery to induce peroxisomal fragmentation, while this dependency is not observed at mitochondria. Furthermore, although we demonstrate that vMIA is also able to inhibit MAVS oligomerization at mitochondria, our results indicate that this process, such as the whole vMIA-mediated inhibition of the mitochondrial antiviral response, is independent of MFF. These observed differences in the mechanisms of action of vMIA towards both organelles, likely reflect their intrinsic differences and roles throughout the viral infection.\n\nThis study uncovers specific molecular mechanisms that may be further explored as targets for antiviral therapy and highlights the relevance of peroxisomes as platforms for antiviral signalling against HCMV.",

However, the evidence for an oxidative cost of social dominance and reproduction is mixed, in part because organisms have efficient protective mechanisms that can counteract oxidative insults. Further, previous studies have shown that different aspects of oxidative balance, including oxidative damage and antioxidant function, varies dramatically between tissue types, yet few studies have investigated oxidative cost in terms of interconnectedness and coordination within the system. Here, we tested whether dominant and subordinate males of the cichlid Astatotilapa burtoni differ in integration of different components of oxidative stress. We assessed 7 markers of oxidative stress, which included both oxidative damage and antioxidant function in various tissue types (total of 14 measurements). Across all oxidative stress measurements, we found more co-regulated clusters in dominant males, suggesting that components of oxidative state are more functionally integrated in dominant males than they are in subordinate males. We discuss how a high degree of functional integration reflects increased robustness or efficiency of the system (e.g. increased effectiveness of antioxidant machinery in reducing oxidative damage), but we also highlight potential costs (e.g. activation of cytoprotective mechanisms may have unwanted pleiotropic effects). Overall, our results suggest that quantifying the extent of functional integration across different components of oxidative stress could reveal insights into the oxidative cost of important life history events.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum, which causes bacterial wilt disease of many crops, needs denitrifying respiration to succeed inside its plant host. In the hypoxic environment of plant xylem vessels this pathogen confronts toxic oxidative radicals like nitric oxide (NO), which is generated by both bacterial denitrification and host defenses. R. solanacearum has multiple distinct mechanisms that could mitigate this stress, including Repair of Iron Cluster (RIC) homolog NorA, nitric oxide reductase NorB, and flavohaemoglobin HmpX. During denitrification and tomato pathogenesis and in response to exogenous NO, R. solanacearum upregulated norA, norB, and hmpX. Single mutants lacking{Delta} norB, {Delta}norA, or{Delta} hmpX increased expression of many iron and sulfur metabolism genes, suggesting that losing even one NO detoxification system demands metabolic compensation. Single mutants suffered only moderate fitness reductions in host plants, possibly because they upregulated their remaining detoxification genes. However,{Delta} norA/norB, {Delta}norB/hmpX, and{Delta} norA/hmpX double mutants grew poorly in denitrifying culture and in planta. Loss of norA, norB, and hmpX may be lethal, since the methods used to construct the double mutants did not generate a triple mutant. Aconitase activity assays showed that NorA, HmpX and especially NorB are important for maintaining iron-sulfur cluster proteins. Additionally, plant defense genes were upregulated in tomatoes infected with the NO-overproducing{Delta} norB mutant, suggesting that bacterial detoxification of NO reduces pathogen visibility. Thus, R. solanacearums three NO detoxification systems each contribute to and are collectively essential for overcoming metabolic oxidative stress during denitrification, for virulence and growth in tomato, and for evading host plant defenses.\n\nImportanceThe soilborne plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) causes bacterial wilt, a serious and widespread threat to global food security. Rs is metabolically adapted to low oxygen conditions, using denitrifying respiration to survive in the host and cause disease. However, bacterial denitrification and host defenses generate nitric oxide (NO), which is toxic and also alters signaling pathways in both plants and the pathogen. Rs mitigates NO with a trio of mechanistically distinct proteins: NO-reductase NorB, Repair of Iron Centers NorA, and oxidoreductase HmpX. This redundancy, together with analysis of mutants and in-planta dual transcriptomes, indicates that maintaining low NO levels is integral to Rs fitness in tomatoes (because NO damages iron-cluster proteins) and to evading host recognition (because bacterially produced NO can trigger plant defenses).",

    "preprint_abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the seed microbiome due to its important role as an end and starting point of plant microbiome assembly that can have consequences for plant health. However, the effect of abiotic conditions on the seed microbial community remains unknown. We performed a pilot study in a controlled growth chamber to investigate how the endophytic seed microbiome of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. (var. Red Hawk)) was altered under abiotic treatments relevant for crop management with changing climate. Bean plants were subjected to one of three treatments: 66% water withholding to simulate mild drought, 50% Hoagland nutrient solution to simulate fertilization, or control with sufficient water and baseline nutrition. We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and ITS1 amplicon sequencing of the endophytic DNA to assess seed bacterial/archaeal and fungal community structure, respectively. We found that variability in the seed microbiome structure was high while alpha diversity was low, with tens of taxa present. Water withholding and nutrient addition altered the seed microbiome structure for bacterial/archaeal communities as compared to the control, and each treatment resulted in a distinct microbiome structure. There were no statistically supported differences in the fungal microbiome across treatments. While we discuss several limitations of this study, the promising results suggest that further investigation is needed to better understand abiotic or stress-induced changes in the seed microbiome, the mechanisms that drive those changes, and their implications for the health and stress responses of the next plant generation.\n\nImportanceSeed microbiome members initiate the assembly of plant-associated microbial communities, but the environmental drivers of endophytic seed microbiome composition are unclear. Here, we exposed plants to short-term drought and fertilizer treatments during early vegetative growth and quantified the microbiome composition of the seeds that were ultimately produced. We found that seeds produced by plants stressed by water limitation or receiving nutrient addition had statistically different endophytic bacterial/archaeal microbiome compositions from each other and from seeds produced by control plants. This work suggests that the abiotic experience of a parental plant can influence the composition of its seed microbiome, with unknown consequences for the next plant generation.",

Current approaches deliver TMS during brain states that correlate with motor cortex (M1) excitability at the group level. Here, we hypothesized that machine learning classifiers could successfully discriminate between high and low M1 excitability states in individual participants using information obtained from low-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To test this, we analyzed a publicly available dataset that delivered 600 single TMS pulses to the right M1 during EEG and electromyography (EMG) recordings in 20 healthy adults. Multivariate pattern classification was used to discriminate between brain states during which TMS evoked small and large motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Results show that personalized classifiers successfully discriminated between low and high M1 excitability states in 80% of tested participants. MEPs elicited during classifier-predicted high excitability states were significantly larger than those elicited during classifier-predicted low excitability states in 90% of tested participants. Personalized classifiers did not generalize across participants. Overall, results show that individual participants exhibit unique brain activity patterns which predict low and high M1 excitability states and that these patterns can be efficiently captured using low-density EEG signals. Our findings suggest that deploying individualized classifiers during brain state-dependent TMS may enable fully personalized neuromodulation in the future.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The dynamical and physiological basis of alpha band activity and 1/f{beta} noise in the EEG are the subject of continued speculation. Here we conjecture, on the basis of empirical data analysis, that both of these features may be economically accounted for through a single process if the resting EEG is conceived of being the sum of multiple stochastically perturbed alpha band damped linear oscillators with a distribution of dampings (relaxation rates). The modulation of alpha-band and 1/f{beta} noise activity by changes in damping is explored in eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting state EEG. We aim to estimate the distribution of dampings by solving an inverse problem applied to EEG power spectra. The characteristics of the damping distribution are examined across subjects, sensors and recording condition (EC/EO). We find that there are robust changes in the damping distribution between EC and EO recording conditions across participants. The estimated damping distributions are found to be predominantly bimodal, with the number and position of the modes related to the sharpness of the alpha resonance and the scaling ({beta}) of the power spectrum (1/f{beta}). The results suggest that there exists an intimate relationship between resting state alpha activity and 1/f{beta} noise with changes in both governed by changes to the damping of the underlying alpha oscillatory processes. In particular, alpha-blocking is observed to be the result of the most weakly damped distribution mode becoming more heavily damped. The results suggest a novel way of characterizing resting EEG power spectra and provides new insight into the central role that damped alpha-band activity may play in characterising the spatio-temporal features of resting state EEG.\n\nAuthor summaryThe resting human electroencephalogram (EEG) exhibits two dominant spectral features: the alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) and its associated attenuation between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state (alpha blocking), and the 1/f{beta} scaling of the power spectrum. While these phenomena are well studied a thorough understanding of their respective generative processes remains elusive. By employing a theoretical approach that follows from neural population models of EEG we demonstrate that it is possible to economically account for both of these phenomena using a singular mechanistic framework: resting EEG is assumed to arise from the summed activity of multiple uncorrelated, stochastically driven, damped alpha band linear oscillatory processes having a distribution of relaxation rates or dampings. By numerically estimating these damping distributions from eyes-closed and eyes-open EEG data, in a total of 136 participants, it is found that such damping distributions are predominantly bimodal in shape. The most weakly damped mode is found to account for alpha band power, with alpha blocking being driven by an increase in the damping of this weakly damped mode, whereas the second, and more heavily damped mode, is able to explain 1/f{beta} scaling present in the resting state EEG spectra.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The ubiquitin-mediated degradation of oocyte translational regulatory proteins is a conserved feature of the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, multiple translational regulatory proteins, including the TRIM-NHL RNA-binding protein LIN-41/Trim71 and the Pumilio-family RNA-binding proteins PUF-3 and PUF-11, are degraded during the OET. Degradation of each protein requires activation of the M-phase cyclin-dependent kinase CDK-1, is largely complete by the end of the first meiotic division and does not require the anaphase promoting complex (APC). However, only LIN-41 degradation requires the F-box protein SEL-10/FBW7/Cdc4p, the substrate recognition subunit of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This finding suggests that PUF-3 and PUF-11, which localize to LIN-41-containing ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), are independently degraded through the action of other factors and that the oocyte RNPs are disassembled in a concerted fashion during the OET. We develop and test the hypothesis that PUF-3 and PUF-11 are targeted for degradation by the proteasome-associated HECT-type ubiquitin ligase ETC-1/UBE3C/Hu15, which is broadly expressed in C. elegans. We find that several GFP-tagged fusion proteins that are degraded during the OET, including fusions with PUF-3, PUF-11, LIN-41, IFY-1/Securin and CYB-1/Cyclin B, are incompletely degraded when ETC-1 function is compromised. However, it is the fused GFP moiety that appears to be the critical determinant of this proteolysis defect. These findings are consistent with a conserved role for ETC-1 in promoting proteasome processivity and suggest that proteasomal processivity is an important element of the OET during which many key oocyte regulatory proteins are rapidly targeted for degradation.\n\nArticle SummaryThe ubiquitin-mediated degradation of translational regulatory RNA-binding proteins is a conserved feature of the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET). C. elegans LIN-41 is a master regulator of oogenesis and is found in a large translational regulatory ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with more than 1000 maternal transcripts and the Pumilio-family RNA-binding proteins PUF-3 and PUF-11. We show that the concerted action of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and proteasome processivity rapidly disassemble LIN-41-containing RNPs during the OET thereby relieving repression of many maternal transcripts.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Residue-level coarse-grained (CG) models have become one of the most popular tools in biomolecular simulations in the trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. To investigate large-scale biological phenomena in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with CG models, unified treatments of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as efficient parallel computations, are indispensable. In the GENESIS MD software, we implement several residue-level CG models, covering structure-based and context-based potentials for both well-folded biomolecules and intrinsically disordered regions. An amino acid residue in protein is represented as a single CG particle centered at the C atom position, while a nucleotide in RNA or DNA is modeled with three beads. Then, a single CG particle represents around ten heavy atoms in both proteins and nucleic acids. The input data in CG MD simulations are treated as GROMACS-style input files generated from a newly developed toolbox, GENESIS-CG-tool. To optimize the performance in CG MD simulations, we utilize multiple neighbor lists, each of which is attached to a different nonbonded interaction potential in the cell-linked list method. We found that random number generations for Gaussian distributions in the Langevin thermostat are one of the bottlenecks in CG MD simulations. Therefore, we parallelize the computations with message-passing-interface (MPI) to improve the performance on PC clusters or supercomputers. We simulate Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 B-capsid and chromatin models containing more than 1,000 nucleosomes in GENESIS as examples of large-scale biomolecular simulations with residue-level CG models. This framework extends accessible spatial and temporal scales by multi-scale simulations to study biologically relevant phenomena, such as genome-scale chromatin folding or phase-separated membrane-less condensations.\n\nAuthor summaryMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely used to investigate biological phenomena that are difficult to study only with experiments. Since all-atom MD simulations of large biomolecular complexes are computationally expensive, coarse-grained (CG) models based on different approximations and interaction potentials have been developed so far. There are two practical issues in biological MD simulations with CG models. The first issue is the input file generations of highly heterogeneous systems. In contrast to well-established all-atom models, specific features are introduced in each CG model, making it difficult to generate input data for the systems containing different types of biomolecules. The second issue is how to improve the computational performance in CG MD simulations of heterogeneous biological systems. Here, we introduce a user-friendly toolbox to generate input files of residue-level CG models containing folded and disordered proteins, RNAs, and DNAs using a unified format and optimize the performance of CG MD simulations via efficient parallelization in GENESIS software. Our implementation will serve as a framework to develop novel CG models and investigate various biological phenomena in the cell.",

We validate our model experimentally and show that the binding energy is a non-linear function, allowing us to tune interaction by varying the radius and degrees of polymerisation.

We found a significant and heterogeneous effect of immune dysfunction on the brains of both male and female mice. However, by imaging the whole brain and using bayesian hierarchical modelling, we were able to identify patterns within the heterogeneous phenotype. Certain structures -- such as the corpus callosum, midbrain, and thalamus -- were more likely to be affected by immune dysfunction. A notable brain-behaviour relationship was identified with neuroanatomy endophenotypes across mouse models clustering according to anxiety-like behaviour phenotypes reported in literature, such as altered volume in brains regions associated with promoting fear response (e.g., the lateral septum and cerebellum). Interestingly, genes with preferential spatial expression in the most commonly affected regions are also associated with multiple sclerosis and other immune-mediated diseases.

We observed distinct features of inheritance and reconstruction of nucleosome position in both paternal and maternal genomes. Genome-wide de novo nucleosome occupancy in the paternal genome was observed as early as 1 hour after the injection of sperm into ooplasm. The nucleosome positioning pattern was continually rebuilt to form nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) at promoters and transcription factor (TF) binding sites with differential dynamics in paternal and maternal genomes. NDRs formed more quickly on the promoters of genes involved in zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and this formation is closely connected with histone acetylation, but not transcription elongation or DNA replication. Importantly, we found that NDR establishment on the binding motifs of specific TFs might be associated with their potential pioneer functions in ZGA. Further investigations suggested that the predicted factors MLX and RFX1 played important roles in regulating minor and major ZGA, respectively. Our data not only elucidate the nucleosome positioning dynamics in both male and female pronuclei following fertilization, but also provide an efficient method for identifying key transcription regulators during development.",

However, animals risk making recognition mistakes because the signal properties of different individuals often overlap due to within-individual variation in signal production. To understand the relationship between signal variation and decision rules for social recognition, we studied male golden rocket frogs, which recognize the calls of territory neighbors and respond less aggressively to a neighbors calls than to the calls of strangers. We quantified patterns of individual variation in acoustic properties of calls and predicted optimal discrimination thresholds using a signal detection theory model of receiver utility that incorporated signal variation, the payoffs of correct and incorrect decisions, and the rates of encounters with neighbors and strangers. We then experimentally determined thresholds for discriminating between neighbors and strangers using a habituation-discrimination experiment with territorial males in the field. Males required a threshold difference between 9% and 12% to discriminate between calls differing in temporal properties; this threshold matched those predicted by a signal detection theory model under ecologically realistic assumptions of infrequent encounters with strangers and relatively costly missed detections of strangers. We demonstrate empirically that receivers group continuous variation in vocalizations into discrete social categories and show that signal detection theory can be applied to investigate evolved decision rules.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Conotoxins are a large group of naturally occurring toxic peptides produced by the predatory sea snails of the genus Conus. Many of these toxins target ion channels, often with high specificity and affinity. As such, they have proven to be invaluable for basic research as well as acting as leads for therapeutic strategies. Con-ikot-ikot is the only conotoxin so far identified that targets AMPA-type glutamate receptors, the main mediators of excitatory neurotransmission in the vertebrate brain. Here, we describe how the toxin modifies the activity of AMPA receptors at the single-channel level. The toxin binds to the AMPA receptor with high affinity (EC50 = 5 nM) and once bound, takes minutes to wash out. As shown previously, it effectively blocks desensitization of AMPA receptors, however, compared to other desensitisation blockers, it is a poor stabiliser of the open channel because toxin-bound AMPA receptors undergo frequent, brief closures. We propose this is a direct consequence of the toxins unique binding mode to the ligand binding domains. Unlike other blockers of desensitization, which stabilise individual dimers within an AMPA receptor tetramer, the toxin immobilizes all four ligand binding domains of the tetramer. This result further emphasises that quaternary reorganization of independent LBD dimers is essential for the full activity of AMPA receptors.",

Here we isolate a panel of 44 anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from an individual who received two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine at a 12-week interval. We show that despite a relatively low serum neutralization titre, mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2) were obtained. The vaccine elicited neutralizing mAbs form 8 distinct competition groups and bind epitopes overlapping with neutralizing mAbs elicited following SARS-CoV-2 infection. AZD1222 elicited mAbs are more mutated than mAbs isolated from convalescent donors 1-2 months post infection. Spike reactive IgG+ B cells were still detectable 9-months post boost.

The factors shaping the composition of these communities are poorly understood: some proposed explanations emphasize the influence of local habitat conditions (niche-based explanations), while others point to geographic structure and the distance among sampled locations (dispersal-based explanations). However, the relative roles of these different drivers for microbial community assembly on human-associated surfaces are not clear. Here, we used a combination of sampling, sequencing (16S rRNA) and culturing to show that the composition of banknote-associated bacterial communities varies depending on the local collection environment. Using banknotes collected from various locations and types of shops across Switzerland, we found taxonomic diversity dominated by families such as Pseudomonadaceae and Staphylococcaceae, but with banknote samples from particular types of shops (especially butcher shops) having distinct community structure. By contrast, we found no evidence of geographic structure: similarity of community composition did not decrease with increasing distance among sampled locations. These results show that microbial communities associated with banknotes, one of the most commonly encountered and exchanged human-associated surfaces, can reflect the local environmental conditions (in this case, the type of shop), and the signal for this type of variation was stronger than that for geographic structure among the locations sampled here.",

In this work, we compared for the first time their intracellular trascriptomic architecture and cellular phenotypes during epithelial cell infection. While transcription induction of many metal transport systems, purines, biotin, PhoPQ and SPI-2 regulons was common in both intracellular SPA and STM, we identified 234 differentially expressed genes that showed distinct expression patterns in intracellular SPA vs. STM. Surprisingly, clear expression differences were found in SPI-1, motility and chemotaxis, and carbon (mainly citrate, galactonate and ethanolamine) utilization pathways, indicating that these pathways are regulated and possibly function differently, during their intracellular phase. Moreover, we show that the induction of flagella genes by intracellular SPA leads to cytosolic motility, a conserved trait specific to SPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a flagellum-dependent intracellular motility of any Salmonella serovar in living host cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the elevated expression of SPI-1 and motility genes by intracellular SPA results in increased invasiveness of SPA, following exit from host cells. We propose that such changes prime SPA towards new cycles of host cell infection and contribute to the ability of SPA to disseminate beyond the intestinal lamina propria of the human host, during enteric fever.\n\nIMPORTANCESalmonella enterica is a ubiquitous, facultative intracellular animal and human pathogen. Although non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and typhoidal Salmonella serovars belong to the same phylogenetic species and share many virulence factors, the disease they cause in humans is very different. While the underlying mechanisms for these differences are not fully understood, one possible reason expected to contribute to their different pathogenicity is a distinct expression pattern of genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Here, we compared the global gene expression and the intracellular behavior, during epithelial cell infection of S. Paratyphi A (SPA) and S. Typhimurium (STM), as prototypical serovars of typhoidal and NTS, respectively. Interestingly, we identified different expression patterns in key virulence and metabolic pathways, together with intracellular motility and increased invasiveness of SPA, following exit from infected cells. We hypothesize that these differences are pivotal to the invasive and systemic disease developed following SPA infection in humans.",

However, efforts to confirm this hypothesis have been hindered by the infeasibility of testing arbitrarily large numbers of antibody sequences for their most critical design parameters: paratope, epitope, affinity, and developability. To address this challenge, we leveraged a lattice-based antibody-antigen binding simulation framework, which incorporates a wide range of physiological antibody binding parameters. The simulation framework enables both the computation of antibody-antigen 3D-structures as well as functions as an oracle for unrestricted prospective evaluation of the antigen specificity of ML-generated antibody sequences. We found that a deep generative model, trained exclusively on antibody sequence (1D) data can be used to design native-like conformational (3D) epitope-specific antibodies, matching or exceeding the training dataset in affinity and developability variety. Furthermore, we show that transfer learning enables the generation of high-affinity antibody sequences from low-N training data. Finally, we validated that the antibody design insight gained from simulated antibody-antigen binding data is applicable to experimental real-world data.

We observed substantial global consistency, with molecular identity explaining 41% of the variance in individual pleasantness rankings, while culture explained only 6%.

Although awake imaging brings with it many advantages, we still do not fully understand how voluntary locomotion during imaging affects sensory-evoked haemodynamic responses. In this study we investigated how evoked haemodynamic responses can be affected by the amount and timing of locomotion. Using an awake imaging set up, we used 2D-Optical Imaging Spectroscopy (2D-OIS) to measure changes in cerebral haemodynamics within the sensory cortex of the brain during either 2s whisker stimulation or spontaneous (no whisker stimulation) experiments, whilst animals could walk on a spherical treadmill. We show that locomotion alters haemodynamic responses. The amount and timing of locomotion relative to whisker stimulation is important, and can significantly impact sensory-evoked haemodynamic responses. If locomotion occurred before or during whisker stimulation, the amplitude of the stimulus-evoked haemodynamic response was significantly altered. Therefore, monitoring of locomotion during awake imaging is necessary to ensure that conclusions based on comparisons of evoked haemodynamic responses (e.g., between control and disease groups) are not confounded by the effects of locomotion.",

Habitat heterogeneity and out-of-equilibrium colonization histories are well recognized as potentially causing species associations, even when interactions are absent. The potential for patch disturbance, a classical component of metacommunity dynamics, to also drive spurious species associations has however been over-looked.\nC_LIO_LI2: Using a new general metacommunity model, we derive mathematical predictions regarding how patch disturbance would affect the patterns of species associations detected in \"null\" co-occurrence matrices. We also conduct numerical simulations to test our predictions and to compare the performance of several widespread statistical methods, including direct tests of pairwise independence, matrix permutation approaches and joint species distribution modelling.\nC_LIO_LI3: We show how classical metacommunity dynamics can produce statistical associations, both positive and negative, even when species do not interact, when there is no habitat heterogeneity, and at equilibrium. This occurs as soon as there is some rate of patch disturbance (i.e. simultaneous extinction of several species in a patch) and/or a finite life-span of patches, a common feature of a broad range of plant, animal or microbial systems.\nC_LIO_LI4: Patch disturbance can compromise species co-occurrence analyses and cause the artefactual detection of species associations if not taken into account. Including patch age (i.e. the time since the last patch disturbance event) as a covariate in a joint species distribution model can resolve the artefact. However, this requires additional data that often are not available in practice. We argue that the consequences of patch disturbance should not be underestimated when analysing species distribution patterns in metacommunity-like systems.\nC_LI",

These systems are regarded as evolutionary paradoxes because of the production of sex-reversed individuals and non-viable embryos, but they nevertheless seem stable over evolutionary time. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for their stability, including models involving sex chromosome drive (i.e., biased transmission of sex chromosomes to the next generation). Here we corroborate this hypothesis in Mus minutoides, a close relative of the house mouse in which the presence of XY females is due to the evolution of a third sex chromosome: a feminizing X. Through extensive molecular sexing of pups at weaning, we reveal the existence of a remarkable male sex chromosome drive system in this species, whereby direction and strength of drive is conditional upon the genotype of males partners: males transmit their Y to almost 80% of their offspring when mating with XX females, and only 36% when mating with XY females. Using mathematical modelling, we explore the joint evolution of these unusual sex-determining and drive systems, revealing that different sequences of events could have led to the evolution of this bizarre system, and that the \"conditional\" nature of sex chromosome drive stabilizes the feminizing X, and even precludes a return to a standard XX/XY system.",

The ROI E-field can be computationally maximized and set to match a specific reference using individualized head models to find the optimal coil placement and stimulus intensity. However, the available software lacks many practical features for prospective planning of TMS interventions and retrospective evaluation of the experimental targeting accuracy.\n\nApproachThe TMS targeting and analysis pipeline (TAP) software uses an MRI/fMRI-derived brain target to optimize coil placement considering experimental parameters such as the subjects hair thickness and coil placement restrictions. The coil placement optimization is implemented in SimNIBS 3.2, for which an additional graphical user interface (TargetingNavigator) is provided to visualize and adjust procedural parameters. The coil optimization process also computes the E-field at the target, allowing the selection of the TMS device intensity setting to achieve a specific E-field strength. The optimized coil placement information is prepared for neuronavigation software, which supports targeting during the TMS procedure. The neuronavigation system can record the coil placement during the experiment, and these data can be processed in TAP to quantify the accuracy of the experimental TMS coil placement and induced E-field.\n\nMain resultsTAP was demonstrated in a study consisting of three repetitive TMS sessions in five subjects. TMS was delivered by an experienced operator under neuronavigation with the computationally optimized coil placement. Analysis of the experimental accuracy from the recorded neuronavigation data indicated coil location and orientation deviations up to about 2 mm and 2{degrees}, respectively, resulting in an 8% median decrease in the target E-field magnitude compared to the optimal placement.\n\nSignificanceTAP supports navigated TMS with a variety of features for rigorous and reproducible stimulation delivery, including planning and evaluation of coil placement and intensity selection for E-field-based dosing.",

It transmits the viruses in a persistent and propagative manner. MMV is an alphanucleorhabdovirus with a negative-sense, single-stranded (ss) RNA unsegmented genome. One identified insect vector protein that may serve as receptor to MMV is Syntaxin-18 (PmStx18) which belongs to the SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors). SNAREs play major roles in the final stage of docking and subsequent fusion of diverse vesicle-mediated transport events. In this work, in silico analysis of the interaction of MMV glycoprotein (MMV G) and PmStx18 was performed. Various freely available protein-protein docking web servers were used to predict the 3D complex of MMV G and PmStx18. Analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) count showed that the complex predicted by the ZDOCK server has the highest number of interaction and highest affinity, as suggested by the calculated solvation free energy gain upon formation of the interface ({Delta}iG = -31 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation of the complex revealed important interactions at the interface over the course of 50 ns. This is the first in silico analysis performed for the interaction on a putative receptor of P. maidis and MMV G. The results of the protein-protein interaction prediction provide novel information for studying the role of STX18 in the transport, docking and fusion events involved in virus particle transport in the insect vector cells and its release.",

As such, concurrent treatment with all three drugs is common. The goals of this study are to better understand the mechanisms underlying the development of triple whammy AKI and to identify physiological factors that may increase an individuals susceptibility. To accomplish these goals, we utilize computational models of long-term blood pressure regulation. These models include variables describing the heart and circulation, kidney function, sodium and water reabsorption in the nephron and the RAS and are parameterized separately for men and women.

LSPS performed on large numbers of neurons yielded maps of functional connections between neurons and allowed calculation of neuronal network parameters. LSPS also provided an indirect measure of excitability of neurons targeted for photostimulation. By repeating LSPS sessions with the same neurons, stability of connections and change in the number and strength of connections were also determined. Experiments were conducted in the presence of bicuculline to study the properties of excitatory neurotransmission. The AMPA receptor inhibitor, 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), abolished synchronous neuronal activity but had no effect on connections mapped by LSPS. In contrast, the NMDA receptor inhibitor, 2-Amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (APV), dramatically decreased the number of functional connections between neurons while also affecting synchronous spontaneous activity. Functional connections were also decreased by increasing extracellular Mg2+ concentration. These data demonstrated that LSPS mapping interrogates NMDA receptor-dependent connectivity between neurons in the network. A GluN2A-specific inhibitor, NVP-AAM077, decreased the number and strength of connections between neurons as well as neuron excitability. Conversely, the GluN2A-specific positive modulator, GNE-0723, increased these same properties. These data showed that LSPS can be used to directly study perturbations in the properties of NMDA receptor-dependent connectivity in neuronal networks. This approach should be applicable in a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo experimental preparations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Rearing temperature is correlated with the timing and speed of development in a wide range of poikiloterm animals that do not regulate their body temperature. However, exceptions exist, especially in species that live in environments with high temperature extremes or oscillations. Drosophila pachea is endemic to the Sonoran desert in Mexico, in which temperatures and temperature variations are extreme. We wondered if the developmental timing in D. pachea may be sensitive to differing rearing temperatures or if it remains constant. We determined the overall timing of the Drosophila pachea life-cycle at different temperatures. The duration of pupal development was similar at 25{degrees}C, 29{degrees}C and 32{degrees}C, although the relative progress differed at particular stages. Thus, D. pachea may have evolved mechanisms to buffer temperature effects on developmental speed, potentially to ensure proper development and individuals fitness in desert climate conditions.",

We used this approach to construct n=442 causal connectomes. These connectomes were very sparse in comparison to typical Pearson correlation-based graphs (roughly 2.25% edge density) yet were fully connected in nearly all cases. Prominent highly connected hubs of the causal connectome were situated in attentional (dorsal attention) and executive (frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular) networks. These hub networks had distinctly different connectivity profiles: attentional networks shared incoming connections with sensory regions and outgoing connections with higher cognitive networks, while executive networks primarily connected to other higher cognitive networks and had a high degree of bidirected connectivity. Virtual lesion analyses accentuated these findings, demonstrating that attentional and executive hub networks are points of critical vulnerability in the human causal connectome. These data highlight the central role of attention and executive control networks in the human cortical connectome and set the stage for future applications of data-driven causal connectivity analysis in psychiatry.",

However, it is unclear how these blood-based patterns relate to patterns within the brain, and how each associates with central cellular profiles. In this study, we profiled DNA methylation in both the blood and in five post-mortem brain regions (BA17, BA20/21, BA24, BA46 and hippocampus) in 14 individuals from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Microglial burdens were additionally quantified in the same brain regions. DNA methylation signatures of five epigenetic ageing biomarkers ( epigenetic clocks), and two inflammatory biomarkers (DNA methylation proxies for C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were compared across tissues and regions. Divergent correlations between the inflammation and ageing signatures in the blood and brain were identified, depending on region assessed. Four out of the five assessed epigenetic age acceleration measures were found to be highest in the hippocampus ({beta} range=0.83-1.14, p[&le;]0.02). The inflammation-related DNA methylation signatures showed no clear variation across brain regions. Reactive microglial burdens were found to be highest in the hippocampus ({beta}=1.32, p=5x10-4); however, the only association identified between the blood- and brain-based methylation signatures and microglia was a significant positive association with acceleration of one epigenetic clock (termed DNAm PhenoAge) averaged over all five brain regions ({beta}=0.40, p=0.002). This work highlights a potential vulnerability of the hippocampus to epigenetic ageing and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between DNA methylation signatures in the brain and differences in microglial burdens.",

We identified Ec-Kbps binding site using NMR spectroscopy to detect protein-thallium scalar couplings and refined the structure of Ec-Kbp in its potassium-bound state. Guided by this structure, we modified KRaION1, yielding KRaION2, which exhibits an isotonically measured Kd of 96{+/-}9 (mM). We identified four Ec-Kbp homologs as potassium binding proteins, which yielded indicators with isotonically measured binding affinities in the 39-112 (mM) range. KRaIONs expressed and functioned in HeLa cells, but exhibited lower Kd values, which were mirrored by lower Kd values measured in vitro when holding sodium constant. Thus, potassium indicator Kd may need to be evaluated in the context of a given experimental goal.",

However, the mechanism causing neuropathological disorders in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients remains unknown. Studies have linked the Th17 subset of CD4+T cells to brain diseases associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment, including multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic brain injury and Alzheimers disease. To better understand how CD4+T lymphocytes, contribute to brain pathology in chronic intestinal inflammation, we investigated the development of brain inflammation in the T cell transfer model of chronic colitis. Our findings demonstrate that CD4+T cells infiltrate the brain of colitic Rag1-/- mice in proportional levels to colitis severity. Colitic mice developed hypothalamic astrogliosis that correlated with neurobehavioral disorders. Moreover, the brain-infiltrating CD4+T cells expressed Th17 cell transcription factor ROR{gamma}t and displayed a pathogenic Th17 cellular phenotype similar to colonic Th17 cells. Adoptive transfer of ROR{gamma}t-deficient naive CD4+T cells failed to cause brain inflammation and neurobehavioral disorders in Rag1-/- recipients, with significantly less brain infiltration of CD4+T cells. These findings suggest that pathogenic ROR{gamma}t+CD4+T cells that aggravate colitis migrate preferentially into the brain, contributing to brain inflammation and neurobehavioral disorders, thereby linking colitis severity to neuroinflammation.",

In this work, we present a new computational resource called ARBRE: Aromatic compounds RetroBiosynthesis Repository and Explorer. It consists of a comprehensive biochemical reaction network centered around aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and a computational toolbox for navigating this network. ARBRE encompasses over 28000 known and 100000 novel reactions predicted with generalized enzymatic reactions rules and over 70000 compounds, of which 22000 are known to biochemical databases and 48000 only to PubChem. Over 1,000 molecules that were solely part of the PubChem database before and were previously impossible to integrate into a biochemical network are included into the ARBRE reaction network by assigning enzymatic reactions. ARBRE can be applied for pathway search, enzyme annotation, pathway ranking, visualization, and network expansion around known biochemical pathways to predict valuable compound derivations. In line with the standards of open science, we have made the toolbox freely available to the scientific community at http://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/arbre/.

Protocols for protein crystal cryoprotection are based on either increasing environmental pressure or reducing the water fraction in the solvent. This study presents a new protocol for cryoprotecting crystals. It is based on vapour diffusion dehydration of the crystal drop to reduce the water fraction in the solvent by adding a highly concentrated salt solution, 13 M potassium formate (KF13), directly to the reservoir. Cryoprotection by the KF13 protocol is non-invasive to the crystal, high throughput, not labour intensive, can benefit diffraction resolution and ligand binding, and is very useful in cases with high redundancy such as drug discovery projects which utilize very large compound or fragment libraries. Moreover, an application of KF13 to discover new crystal hits from clear drops of equilibrated crystallization screening plates is also shown.",

The ratio between T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (T1w/T2w ratio) has been linked to myelin levels and dendrite density and may offer novel insight into the intracortical microstructure of the sleep deprived brain. Here, we examined intracortical T1w/T2w ratio in 41 healthy young adults (26 women) before and after 32 hours of either sleep deprivation (n = 18) or a normal sleep-wake cycle (n = 23). Linear models revealed significant group differences in T1w/T2w ratio change after 32 hours in four clusters, including bilateral effects in the insular, cingulate, and superior temporal cortices, comprising regions involved in attentional, auditory and pain processing. Across clusters, the sleep deprived group showed an increased T1w/T2w ratio, while the normal sleep-wake group exhibited a reduced ratio. These changes were not explained by in-scanner head movement, and 95% of the effects across clusters remained significant after adjusting for cortical thickness and hydration. Compared with a normal sleep-wake cycle, 32 hours of sleep deprivation yields intracortical T1w/T2w ratio increases. While the intracortical changes detected by this study could reflect alterations in myelin or dendritic density, or both, histological analyses are needed to clarify the precise underlying cortical processes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The increasing requirements for adoption of FAIR data management and sharing original research data from neuroimaging studies can be at odds with protecting the anonymity of the research participants due to the person-identifiable anatomical features in the data. We propose a solution to this dilemma for anatomical MRIs used in MEG source analysis. In MEG analysis, the channel-level data is reconstructed to the source-level using models derived from anatomical MRIs. Sharing data, therefore, requires sharing the anatomical MRI to replicate the analysis. The suggested solution is to replace the individual anatomical MRIs with individualised warped templates that can be used to carry out the MEG source analysis and that provide sufficient geometrical similarity to the original participants MRIs.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate how the individualised template warping can be implemented with one of the leading open-source neuroimaging analysis toolboxes. Second, we compare results from four different MEG source reconstruction methods performed with an individualised warped template to those using the participants original MRI. While the source reconstruction results are not numerically identical, there is a high similarity between the results for single dipole fits, dynamic imaging of coherent sources beamforming, and atlas-based virtual channel beamforming. There is a moderate similarity between minimum-norm estimates, as anticipated due to this method being anatomically constrained and dependent on the exact morphological features of the cortical sheet.\n\nWe also compared the morphological features of the warped template to those of the original MRI. These showed a high similarity in grey matter volume and surface area, but a low similarity in the average cortical thickness and the mean folding index within cortical parcels.\n\nTaken together, this demonstrates that the results obtained by MEG source reconstruction can be preserved with the warped templates, whereas the anatomical and morphological fingerprint is sufficiently altered to protect the anonymity of research participants. In cases where participants consent to sharing anatomical MRI data, it remains preferable to share the original defaced data with an appropriate data use agreement. In cases where participants did not consent to share their MRIs, the individualised warped MRI template offers a good compromise in sharing data for reuse while retaining anonymity for those research participants.",

That is, the visual size of an object that \"looks best\" is linked to its typical physical size in the world. Why is this the case? One intuitive possibility is that these preferences are driven by semantic knowledge: For example, when we recognize a sofa, we access our knowledge about its real-world size, and this influences what size we prefer to view the sofa within a frame. However, might visual processing play a role in this phenomenon--that is, do visual features that are related to big and small objects look better at big and small visual sizes, respectively, even when observers do not have explicit access to semantic knowledge about the objects? To test this possibility, we used \"texform\" images, which are synthesized versions of recognizable objects, which critically retain local perceptual texture and coarse contour information, but are no longer explicitly recognizable. To test for visual size preferences, we first used a size adjustment task, and the results were equivocal. However, clear results were obtained using a two-interval forced choice task, in which each texform was presented at the preferred visual size of its corresponding original image, and a visual size slightly bigger or smaller. Observers consistently selected the texform presented at the canonical visual size as the more aesthetically pleasing one. An additional control experiment ruled out alternative explanations related to size priming effects. These results suggest that the preferred visual size of an object depends not only on explicit knowledge of its real-world size, but also can be evoked by mid-level visual features that systematically covary with an objects real-world size.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe prefer to view large objects like cars large, and small objects like cups small\nC_LIO_LIIntuitively, such preferences may be driven by our knowledge of object sizes\nC_LIO_LIWe used unrecognizable texforms of objects that preserved mid-level visual features\nC_LIO_LISimilar viewing size preferences can be revealed with these texforms\nC_LIO_LISuch preferences thus arise not only from knowledge but also from visual processing\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cell viscoelastic properties are affected by the cell cycle, differentiation, pathological processes such as malignant transformation. Therefore, evaluation of the mechanical properties of the cells proved to be an approach to obtaining information on the functional state of the cells. Most of the currently used methods for cell mechanophenotypisation are limited by low robustness or the need for highly expert operation. In this paper, the system and method for viscoelasticity measurement using shear stress induction by fluid flow is described and tested. Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) is used for image acquisition because this technique enables to quantify optical path length delays introduced by the sample, thus providing a label-free objective measure of morphology and dynamics. Viscosity and elasticity determination were refined using a new approach based on the linear system model and parametric deconvolution. The proposed method allows high-throughput measurements during live cell experiments and even through a time-lapse, where we demonstrated the possibility of simultaneous extraction of shear modulus, viscosity, cell morphology, and QPI-derived cell parameters like circularity or cell mass. Additionally, the proposed method provides a simple approach to measure cell refractive index with the same setup, which is required for reliable cell height measurement with QPI, an essential parameter for viscoelasticity calculation. Reliability of the proposed viscoelasticity measurement system was tested in several experiments including cell types of different Young/shear modulus and treatment with cytochalasin D or docetaxel, and an agreement with atomic force microscopy was observed. The applicability of the proposed approach was also confirmed by a time-lapse experiment with cytochalasin D washout, where an increase of stiffness corresponded to actin repolymerisation in time.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe present an approach for viscoelasticity measurement using QPI and shear stress induction by fluid flow. Our system builds and extends a recently published approach by parametric deconvolution, which allows us to eliminate the influence of the fluidic system and reliably measure both the shear modulus and viscosity of the cells in high throughput. Additionally, the proposed method enables to simultaneously determine cell refractive index map, cell dry mass map, and morphology, thereby enabling a multimodal cellular characterisation in a single measurement.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Stability during walking can be maintained by shifts of the Center of Pressure through modulation of foot placement and ankle moments (CoP-mechanism). An additional mechanism to stabilize gait, is the counter-rotation mechanism i.e. changing the angular momentum of segments around the Center of Mass (CoM) to change the direction of the ground reaction force. It is unknown if and how humans use the counter-rotation mechanism to control the CoM during walking and how this interacts with the CoP-mechanism. Thirteen healthy adults walked on a treadmill, while full-body kinematic and force plate data were obtained. The contributions of the CoP and the counter-rotation mechanisms to control the CoM were calculated during steady-state walking, walking on LesSchuh, i.e. constraining mediolateral CoP shifts underneath the stance foot and walking on LesSchuh at 50% of normal step width, constraining both foot placement and ankle mechanisms (LesSchuh50%). A decreased magnitude of within-stride control by the CoP-mechanism was compensated for by an increased magnitude of within-stride control by the counter-rotation mechanism during LesSchuh50% compared to steady-state walking. This suggests that the counter-rotation mechanism is used to stabilize gait when needed. However, the mean contribution of the counter-rotation mechanism over strides did not increase during LesSchuh50% compared to steady-state walking. The CoP-mechanism was the main contributor to the total CoM acceleration. The use of the counter-rotation mechanism may be limited because angular accelerations ultimately need to be reversed and because of interference with other task constraints, such as head stabilization and preventing interference with the gait pattern.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional immunoregulatory protein that is a key player in the innate immune response. Given its overexpression at sites of inflammation in a wide range of diseases marked by increasingly oxidative cellular environment, a comprehensive structural understanding of how cellular redox conditions may impact the structure and function of MIF is necessary. We used solution NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to investigate structural and dynamic signatures of MIF under varied solution redox conditions. Our results indicate that the MIF structure is modified and becomes increasingly dynamic in an oxidative environment, which may be a means to alter the MIF functional response in a redox-dependent manner. We identified latent allosteric sites within MIF that are redox-sensitive and mutational analysis reveals that loss of redox-responsive residues attenuates activation of the coreceptor CD74. Leveraging sites of redox-sensitivity therefore reveals an avenue to modulate MIF function in its \"disease state\" via structure-based drug design.",

Several investigators have reported that the viral spike protein receptor is present in olfactory neurons. However, no study has been published to date showing the presence of viral entry sites angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neuropilin1 (NRP1), and TMPRSS2, the serine protease necessary for priming the viral proteins, in human nerves that are responsible for taste sensation (cranial nerves: VII, IX and X). We used immunocytochemistry to examine three postmortem donor samples of the IXth (glossopharyngeal) and Xth (vagal) cranial nerves where they leave/join the medulla from three donors to confirm the presence of ACE2, NRP1 and TMPRSS2. Two samples were paraffin embedded; one was a frozen sample. In addition to staining sections from the latter, we isolated RNA from it, made cDNA, and performed PCR to confirm the presence of the mRNAs that encode the proteins visualized. All three of the proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 infections appear to be present in the human IXth and Xth nerves near the medulla. Direct infection of these nerves by the COVID-19 virus is likely to cause the loss of taste experienced by many patients. In addition, potential viral spread through these nerves into the adjacent brainstem respiratory centers might also aggravate the respiratory problems patients are experiencing.",

From a public health perspective these changes have important implications for increased transmissibility and immune escape; however, their presence could also modify the intrinsic host-range of the virus.

The larval gut microbiota of S. frugiperda larvae did not differ between the host strains neither was it affected by the geographical distribution of the populations investigated.

If these actions are guided by effector-independent mechanisms, similar kinematics should be observed when the action is performed by the hand or by a cortically remote and less experienced effector, such as the foot. We tested this hypothesis with two characteristic components of action: the initial ballistic stage of reaching, and the preshaping of the digits during grasping based on object size. We examined if these kinematic features reflect effector-independent mechanisms by asking participants to reach toward and to grasp objects of different widths with their hand and foot. First, during both reaching and grasping, the velocity profile up to peak velocity matched between the hand and the foot, indicating a shared ballistic acceleration phase. Secondly, maximum grip aperture and time of maximum grip aperture of grasping increased with object size for both effectors, indicating encoding of object size during transport. Differences between the hand and foot were found in the deceleration phase and time of maximum grip aperture, likely due to biomechanical differences and the participants inexperience with foot actions. These findings provide evidence for effector-independent visuomotor mechanisms of reaching and grasping that generalize across body parts.",

We generated two different constructs bearing basal heat shock promoter-driven Cas9, two distinct 3 UTRs, and one containing Cas9 fused to EGFP by a T2A peptide. For each construct, we were able to generate a line that is homozygous viable, though variable reductions in reproductive success with each construct were noted. Analyses of Cas9 activity in each transgenic line demonstrated that both designs are capable of inducing CRISPR-mediated changes in the genome in the absence of heat induction. Overall, these resources enhance the accessibility of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for the Tribolium research community and provide a benchmark against which to compare future transgenic Cas9 lines.",

Here we quantified the relationship between synaptic count and synaptic area as measured from volume electron microscopy of the larval Drosophila central nervous system. We found that the total synaptic surface area, summed across all synaptic contacts from one presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic one, can be accurately predicted solely from the number of synaptic contacts, for a variety of neurotransmitters.

To date, we lack quantitative understanding as to how design features impact performance of these therapeutics. To address this gap, here we perform a systematic, comparative evaluation of various biologically-derived nanoscale vesicles, which may be particularly well-suited to sustained or repeated administration in the clinic due to low toxicity, and investigate their potential to inhibit multiple classes of model SARS-CoV-2 virions. A key finding is that such particles exhibit potent antiviral efficacy across multiple manufacturing methods, vesicle subclasses, and virus-decoy binding affinities.

    "preprint_abstract": "Malaria is responsible for half a million deaths annually and poses a huge economic burden on the developing world. The mosquito-borne parasites (Plasmodium spp.) that cause the disease depend upon an unconventional actomyosin motor for both gliding motility and host cell invasion. The motor system, often referred to as the glideosome complex, remains to be understood in molecular terms and is an attractive target for new drugs that might block the infection pathway. Here, we present the first high-resolution structure of the actomyosin motor complex from Plasmodium falciparum. Our structure includes the malaria parasite actin filament (PfAct1) complexed with the myosin motor (PfMyoA) and its two associated light-chains. The high-resolution core structure reveals the PfAct1:PfMyoA interface in atomic detail, while at lower-resolution, we visualize the PfMyoA light-chain binding region, including the essential light chain (PfELC) and the myosin tail interacting protein (PfMTIP). Finally, we report a bare PfAct1 filament structure at an improved resolution, which gives new information about the nucleotide-binding site, including the orientation of the ATP/ADP sensor, Ser15, and the presence of a channel, which we propose as a possible phosphate exit path after ATP hydrolysis.Significance statement We present the first structure of the malaria parasite motor complex; actin 1 (PfAct1) and myosin A (PfMyoA) with its two light chains. We also report a high-resolution structure of filamentous PfAct1 that reveals new atomic details of the ATPase site, including a channel, which may provide an exit route for phosphate and explain why phosphate release is faster in PfAct1 compared to canonical actins. PfAct1 goes through no conformational changes upon PfMyoA binding. Our PfMyoA structure also superimposes with a recent crystal structure of PfMyoA alone, though there are small but important conformational changes at the interface. Our structures serve as an excellent starting point for drug design against malaria, which is one of the most devastating infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "preprint_abstract": "Understanding mechanisms that shape horizontal exchange in prokaryotes is a key problem in biology. A major limit on DNA entry is imposed by restriction-modification (RM) processes that depend on the pattern of DNA modification at host-specified sites. In classical RM, endonucleolytic DNA cleavage follows detection of unprotected sites on entering DNA. Recent investigation has uncovered BREX systems, RM-like activities that employ host protection by DNA modification but replication arrest without evident nuclease action on unmodified phage DNA. We show that the historical stySA RM locus of Salmonella enterica sv Typhimurium is a BREX homolog. The stySA29 allele of the hybrid strain LB5000 carries a mutated version of the ancestral LT2 BREX system. Surprisingly, both a restriction and a methylation defect are observed for this lineage despite lack of mutations in brxX, the modification gene homolog. Instead, flanking genes pglZ and brxC each carry multiple mutations () in C-terminal domains. To avoid plasmid artifacts and potential stoichiometric interference, we chose to investigate this system in situ, replacing the mutated pglZ and brxC genes with wild type (WT). PglZ-WT supports methylation in the presence of either BrxC or BrxC-WT but not in the presence of a deletion/insertion allele, {Delta}brxC::cat. Restriction of phage L requires both BrxC-WT and PglZ-WT, implicating the BrxC C-terminus specifically in restriction activity. Disruption of four other CDS with cat cassettes still permitted modification, suggesting that BrxC, PglZ and BrxX are principal components of the modification activity. BrxL is required for restriction only. A partial disruption of brxL disrupts transcription globally.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Centrioles are submicron-scale, barrel-shaped organelles typically found in pairs, and play important roles in ciliogenesis and bipolar spindle assembly. In general, successful execution of centriole-dependent processes is highly reliant on the ability of the cell to stringently control centriole number. This in turn is mainly achieved through the precise duplication of centrioles during each S phase. Aberrations in centriole duplication disrupt spindle assembly and cilia based signaling and have been linked to cancer, primary microcephaly and a variety of growth disorders. Studies aimed at understanding how centriole duplication is controlled have mainly focused on the post-translational regulation of two key components of this pathway: the master regulatory kinase ZYG-1/Plk4 and the scaffold component SAS-6. In contrast, how transcriptional control mechanisms might contribute to this process have not been well explored. Here we show that the chromatin remodeling protein CHD-1 contributes to the regulation of centriole duplication in the C. elegans embryo. Specifically, we find that loss of CHD-1 or inactivation of its ATPase activity can restore embryonic viability and centriole duplication to a strain expressing insufficient ZYG-1 activity. Interestingly, loss of CHD-1 is associated with increases in the levels of two ZYG-1-binding partners: SPD-2, the centriole receptor for ZYG-1 and SAS-6. Finally, we explore transcriptional regulatory networks governing centriole duplication and find that CHD-1 and a second transcription factor, EFL-1/DPL-1 cooperate to down regulate expression of CDK-2, which in turn promotes SAS-6 protein levels. Disruption of this regulatory network results in the overexpression of SAS-6 and the production of extra centrioles.\n\nAuthor SummaryCentrioles are cellular constituents that play an important role in cell reproduction, signaling and movement. To properly function, centrioles must be present in the cell at precise numbers. Errors in maintaining centriole number result in cell division defects and diseases such as cancer and microcephaly. How the cell maintains proper centriole copy number is not entirely understood. Here we show that two transcription factors, EFL-1/DPL-1 and CHD-1 cooperate to reduce expression of CDK-2, a master regulator of the cell cycle. We find that CDK-2 in turn promotes expression of SAS-6, a major building block of centrioles. When EFL-1/DPL-1 and CHD-1 are inhibited, CDK-2 is overexpressed. This leads to increased levels of SAS-6 and excess centrioles. Our work thus demonstrates a novel mechanism for controlling centriole number and is thus relevant to those human diseases caused by defects in centriole copy number control.",

There are currently no effective vaccines or prophylactics to prevent Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Limiting exposure to infected mosquitoes is best way to reduce disease incidence. Recent studies have focused on targeting mosquito reproduction and immune responses to reduce transmission. In particular, previous work evaluated the effect of insulin signaling on antiviral JAK/STAT and RNAi in vector mosquitoes. In this work, we demonstrate that targeting insulin signaling through the repurposing of small molecule drugs results in the activation of both of these antiviral pathways. Activation of this coordinated response additively reduced ZIKV levels in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This effect included a quantitatively greater reduction in salivary gland ZIKV levels relative to single pathway activation, indicating the potential for field delivery of these small molecules to substantially reduce virus transmission.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Arousal levels strongly affect task performance. Yet, what arousal level is optimal for a task depends on its difficulty. Easy task performance peaks at higher arousal levels, whereas performance on difficult tasks displays an inverted U-shape relationship with arousal, peaking at medium arousal levels, an observation first made by Yerkes and Dodson in 1908. It is commonly proposed that the noradrenergic locus coeruleus system regulates these effects on performance through a widespread release of noradrenaline resulting in changes of cortical gain. This account, however, does not explain why performance decays with high arousal levels only in difficult, but not in simple tasks. Here, we present a mechanistic model that revisits the Yerkes-Dodson effect from a sensory perspective: a deep convolutional neural network augmented with a global gain mechanism reproduced the same interaction between arousal state and task difficulty in its performance. Investigating this model revealed that global gain states differentially modulated sensory information encoding across the processing hierarchy, which explained their differential effects on performance on simple versus difficult tasks. These findings offer a novel hierarchical sensory processing account of how, and why, arousal state affects task performance.\n\nAuthors summaryOver a hundred years ago, it was first observed that the effect of arousal on performance depends on task difficulty: the Yerkes-Dodson effect. Difficult tasks are best solved at intermediate arousal levels, whereas easy tasks benefit from a high arousal state. Current theories on how arousal affects neural processing cannot explain this effect of task difficulty. Here, we implement a key effect of arousal on cortical processing, a change in neuronal gain, in a computational model of visual processing capable of object recognition. Across a series of experiments, we find that our model can reproduce the Yerkes-Dodson effect behaviorally and that this effect can be explained by where in the processing hierarchy different arousal states optimize sensory information encoding.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Ratiometric time-lapse FRET analysis requires a robust and accurate processing pipeline to eliminate bias in intensity measurements on fluorescent images before further quantitative analysis can be conducted. This level of robustness can only be achieved by supplementing automated tools with built-in flexibility for manual ad-hoc adjustments. FRET-IBRA is a modular and fully parallelized configuration file-based tool written in Python. It simplifies the FRET processing pipeline to achieve accurate, registered, and unified ratio image stacks. The flexibility of this tool to handle discontinuous image frame sequences with tailored configuration parameters further streamlines the processing of outliers and time-varying effects in the original microscopy images. FRET-IBRA offers cluster-based channel background subtraction, photobleaching correction, and ratio image construction in an all-in-one solution without the need for multiple applications, image format conversions, and/or plug-ins. The package accepts a variety of input formats and outputs TIFF image stacks along with performance measures to detect both the quality and failure of the background subtraction algorithm on a per frame basis. Furthermore, FRET-IBRA outputs images with superior signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy in comparison to existing background subtraction solutions, whilst maintaining a fast runtime. The FRET-IBRA package has been extensively used in quantifying the spatial distribution of calcium ions during pollen tube growth under mechanical constraints. Benchmarks against existing tools clearly demonstrate the need for FRET-IBRA in extracting reliable insights from FRET microscopy images of dynamic physiological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. The source code for Linux and Mac operating systems is released under the BSD license and, along with installation instructions, test images, example configuration files, and a step-by-step tutorial, is freely available at github.com/gmunglani/fret-ibra.\n\nAuthor SummaryFRET is a fundamental imaging technique used to generate fluorescence signals sensitive to molecular conformations and interactions. Despite its wide use and the large body of literature on the theoretical steps required to process images generated from this procedure, we were unable to locate a tool that contained the entire processing workflow, whilst allowing the user the flexibility to adjust parameters for maximum accuracy and runtime efficiency. FRET-IBRA was thus created to be an all-in-one, open-source, parallel solution to process FRET images, while eliminating complications arising from repeated image format conversions. Besides enhancing the background subtraction algorithm for FRET images, several additional options were implemented for the user to extract the cleanest signal possible for their specific use case. FRET-IBRA is primarily built for flexibility when handling large image stacks by supporting sequences of image frames to be treated independently, greatly reducing time spent on splitting and concatenating image stacks. In accuracy and speed benchmarks against more general background subtraction packages, FRET-IBRA was able to provide the cleanest results with a fast runtime, leading to reliable analysis without additional tuning.",

Delivery of siRNA therapeutics to the liver has been established, with conjugation of siRNA to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) providing durable gene knockdown in hepatocytes following subcutaneous injection. GalNAc binds the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) that is highly expressed on hepatocytes and exploits this scavenger receptor to deliver siRNA across the plasma membrane by endocytosis. However, siRNA needs to access the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm to provide effective gene knockdown and the entire siRNA delivery process is very inefficient, likely due to steps required for endosomal escape, intracellular trafficking, and stability of siRNA. To reveal the cellular factors limiting delivery of siRNA therapeutics, we performed a pooled, genome wide knockout screen based on delivery of GalNAc conjugated siRNA targeting the HPRT1 gene in the human hepatocellular carcinoma line Hep3B. Our primary pooled genome wide knockout screen identified candidate genes that when knocked out significantly enhanced siRNA efficacy in Hep3B cells. Follow-up studies indicate that knockout of one gene in particular, RAB18, improved siRNA efficacy.",

In the current study, we investigate the relationship between body part representations within individual neuronal populations in motor cortices, following a 7 Tesla fMRI 18-body-part motor experiment in combination with our newly developed non-rigid population Response Field (pRF) model and graph theory. The non-rigid pRF metrics reveal somatotopic structures in all included motor cortices covering frontal, parietal, medial and insular cortices and that neuronal populations in primary sensorimotor cortex respond to fewer body parts than secondary motor cortices. Reciprocal body part relationships are estimated in terms of uniqueness, clique-formation, and importance. We report unique response profiles for the knee, a clique of body parts surrounding the ring finger, and a central role for the shoulder and wrist. These results reveal associations among body parts from the perspective of the central nervous system, while being in agreement with intuitive notions of body part usage.",

In the present study we administered TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) in male and female Long-Evans rats to determine whether TLR3 agonism can increase alcohol consumption in a daily 15% alcohol operant self-administration paradigm. We found few effects when poly(I:C) was given every-other-day at 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg, however when instead 1.0 mg/kg was given on consecutive days alcohol intake increased in the days following injections specifically in females. Furthermore, in a second experiment we found that this effect only emerged when rats had a history of multiple poly(I:C) injections. In the final experiment the dose was increased to 3.0 mg/kg on consecutive days which resulted in significant reductions on injection days in females that were not accompanied by subsequent increases. The dose was increased to 9 mg/kg for one final pair of injections which led to reductions in intake in both males and females but only increased subsequent alcohol consumption in males. Overall, poly(I:C) was able to increase subsequent alcohol consumption in both sexes, with females being sensitive to lower doses than males both in terms of changes in alcohol consumption and general locomotor reduction. These findings show that TLR3 agonism may be involved in driving increased alcohol consumption and add to the body of work identifying the neuroimmune system as a potential therapeutic target for AUD.",

In particular, the striatal cholinergic system is thought to be important for the modulation of striatal activity. Research from animal literature has shown that chemical inactivation of the dorsal striatum leads to impairments in reversal learning. Furthermore, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy work has shown that the striatal cholinergic system is also important for reversal learning in humans. Here, we aim to assess whether the state of the dorsal striatal cholinergic system at rest is related to flexible behaviour in reversal learning. We provide preliminary results showing that variability in choline in the dorsal striatum is significantly related to both the number perseverative and regressive errors that participants make, and their rate of learning from positive and negative prediction errors. These findings, in line with previous work, suggest the resting state of dorsal striatal cholinergic system has important implications for producing flexible behaviour. However, these results also suggest the system may have heterogeneous functionality across different types of tasks measuring behavioural flexibility. These findings provide a starting point for further interrogation into understanding the functional role of the striatal cholinergic system in flexibility.",

DNA from blood at inclusion and at the 6-years visit was subjected to methylation analysis using 850K methylation-EPIC arrays. A linear mixed model was used to perform an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and identify methylated changes associated with hyperglycaemia exposure during 6-year time-period.\n\nResultsWe did not identify differentially methylated sites that reached FDR-significance in our cohort.

We also performed an EWAS with HbA1c, using the inclusion and the 6-years methylation data and did not identify any FDR-significant CpGs.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals that DNA methylation changes are not robustly associated with hyperglycaemia exposure or HbA1c during a short-term period, however, our top loci indicate potential interest and should be replicated in larger cohorts.",

There are generally two types of cortical projection neurons: those that project locally and interhemispherically, and those that project to sub-cerebral structures such as the thalamus, hindbrain, and spinal cord. The regulation of cortical projection morphologies is not yet fully understood at the molecular level. Here we report a role for Mllt11 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to chromosome 11/All1 Fused Gene From Chromosome 1q) in the migration and neurite outgrowth of callosal projection neurons during brain formation. We show that Mllt11 expression is exclusive to developing neurons and is enriched in the developing cortical plate, particularly during the formation of the upper or superficial cortical layers. In cultured primary cortical neurons, Mllt11 is detected in varicosities and growth cones as well as the soma. Using conditional loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis we show that Mllt11 is a required for neuritogenesis and proper migration of upper layer cortical projection neurons. Loss of Mllt11 in the superficial cortex leads to a severe reduction in fibres crossing the corpus callosum, a progressive loss in the maintenance of upper layer projection neuron gene expression, and dysplasia of dendritic arborisation patterns. Proteomic analysis revealed that Mllt11 associates with cytoskeletal components including stabilized microtubules consistent with a role in neuronal migration and neuritogenesis. Taken together, our findings support a role for Mllt11 in promoting the formation of mature projection neuron morphologies and connectivity in the cerebral cortex.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Vocalizations, like many social displays, are often elaborate, rhythmically structured behaviors that are modulated by a complex combination of cues. Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alstons singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), for example, each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguous for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally co-label neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong co-labeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive co-labeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. Although we observe some novel patterns of double-labelling, the progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.",

We also show that this correction results in a more accurate description of self-association of IDPs and folded proteins and better agreement with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data for most IDPs.

Such effects have been previously shown to significantly impact common network metrics.

We assess a commonly employed harmonization method and propose new methodology for harmonizing functional connectivity that leverage existing knowledge about network structure as well as patterns of covariance in the data. Finally, we demonstrate that our new methods reduce scanner effects in community structure and network metrics.

Additional omics data integration enables a more precise genotype-phenotype analysis for biotechnology, medicine and life sciences. Transcriptome data amounts rapidly increase each year. Many transcriptome analysis tools with integrated genome scale metabolic modelling are proposed. But these tools have own restrictions, compatibility issues and the necessity of previous experience and advanced user skills. We have analysed and classified published tools, summarized possible transcriptome pre-processing, and analysis methods and implemented them in the new transcriptome analysis tool IgemRNA. Tool novelty is the possibility of transcriptomics data pre-processing approach, analysis of transcriptome with or without genome scale metabolic models and different thresholding and gene mapping approach availability. In comparison with usual Gene set enrichment analysis methods, IgemRNA options provide additional transcriptome data validation, where minimal metabolic network connectivity and flux requirements are met.

The assay has two components: fluorescent polystyrene particles covalently coated with RBD, termed virion-particles (v-particles), and fluorescently-labeled hACE2 (hACE2F) that binds the v-particles. When incubated with an inhibitor, v-particle - hACE2F binding is diminished, resulting in a reduction in the fluorescent signal of bound hACE2F relative to the non-inhibitor control, which can be measured via flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. We determine the amount of RBD needed for v-particle preparation, v-particle incubation time with hACE2F, hACE2F detection limit, and specificity of v-particle binding to hACE2F. We measure the dose response of the v-particles to a known inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that RNA-hACE2F granules trap v-particles effectively, providing a basis for potential RNA-hACE2F therapeutics.",

Leaf senescence is controlled by genetic information via gene expression and epigenetic modification, but the precise mechanism is as of yet unclear. Here, we analyzed genome-wide acetylated lysine residue 9 of histone H3 (H3K9ac) enrichment by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and examined its association with transcriptomes by RNA-seq during flag leaf aging in rice (Oryza sativa). We found that genome-wide H3K9 acetylation levels increased with age-dependent senescence in rice flag leaf, and there was a positive correlation between the density and breadth of H3K9ac and gene expression and transcript elongation. A set of 1,249 up-regulated, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 996 down-regulated DEGs showing a strong relationship between temporal changes in gene expression and gain/loss of H3K9ac was observed during rice flag leaf aging. We produced a landscape of H3K9 acetylation-modified gene expression targets that includes known senescence-associated genes, metabolism-related genes, as well as miRNA biosynthesis-related genes. Our findings reveal a complex regulatory network of metabolism- and senescence-related pathways mediated by H3K9ac and also elucidate patterns of H3K9ac-mediated regulation of gene expression during flag leaf aging in rice.\n\nSignificance statementGenome-wide H3K9 acetylation levels increased with age-dependent senescence in rice flag leaf, and positively correlation the density and breadth of H3K9ac with transcript elongation and expression.

    "preprint_abstract": "When free-roaming in natural areas, the domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) is ranked high among the most destructive alien species. Near human dwellings, it might risk humans, impair sanitation, and suffer from poor welfare. Cats popularity as companion animals complicates their population control. Thus, culling is often replaced by a fertility control method called \"Trap-Neuter-Return/Release (TNR),\" which is considered more humane. Despite the extensive application of TNR, a long-term controlled study was never performed to test its effectiveness. We present a uniquely designed controlled field experiment for examining TNR effectiveness. The study was performed over a twelve-year period, divided into pre-intervention, mixed- and full-intervention phases, and spanned a 20Km2 urban area. Trends of cat, intact-female, and kitten counts, cat reproduction, and carcass reports were compared among study phases and areas with different neutering intensities. The cat population increased during the first two study phases and did not decline in highly neutered populations, presumably due to cat immigration. Expansion of high-intensity neutering to the entire city in the full-intervention phase (>70% neutering percentage) reversed cat population growth, reaching an annual ca. 7% reduction. This population reduction was limited by a rebound increase in cat reproduction and longevity. We conclude that cat population management by TNR should be performed in high-intensity, continuously, and in geographic contiguity to enable population reduction. To enhance management effectiveness and mitigate compensatory effects, we recommend further evaluating an integrated strategy that combines TNR with complementary methods (e.g., vital resource regulation, ill cat euthanasia, and adoption).\n\nSignificance StatementThough popular companion animals, domestic cats pose numerous problems when free-roaming, including predation of wildlife, hazards to humans, impaired sanitation, and a decrease in their welfare. Thus, managing their populations is essential. The Trap-Neuter-Return method (TNR, capturing, sterilizing, returning/releasing) is widely employed for managing cat populations. However, there is a lack of long-term controlled evidence for its effectiveness. We examined the outcomes of high-intensity TNR by performing a twelve-year controlled field experiment, the largest to date. Neutering over 70% of the cats caused population decline when applied over contiguous areas. However, it was limited by a rebound increase in reproduction and survival. These findings provide a robust quantification of the limitations and the long-term effectiveness of TNR.",

    "preprint_abstract": "During spermatogenesis, spermatogonia undergo a series of mitotic and meiotic divisions on their path to spermatozoa. To achieve this, a succession of processes requiring high proteolytic activity are in part orchestrated by the proteasome. The spermatoproteasome (s20S) is specific to the developing gametes, in which the gamete-specific 4s subunit replaces the 4 isoform found in the constitutive proteasome (c20S). Although the s20S is conserved across species and was shown to be crucial for germ cell development, its mechanism, function and structure remain incompletely characterized. Here, we used advanced mass spectrometry (MS) methods to map the composition of proteasome complexes and their interactomes throughout spermatogenesis. We observed that the s20S becomes highly activated as germ cells enter meiosis, mainly through a particularly extensive 19S activation and, to a lesser extent, PA200 binding. Additionally, the proteasome population shifts from c20S (98%) to s20S (>82-92%) during differentiation, presumably due to the shift from 4 to 4s expression. We demonstrated that s20S, but not c20S, interacts with components of the meiotic synaptonemal complex, where it may localize via association with the PI31 adaptor protein. In vitro, s20S preferentially binds to 19S, and displays higher trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activities, both with and without PA200 activation. Moreover, using MS methods to monitor protein dynamics, we identified significant differences in domain flexibility between 4 and 4s. We propose that these differences induced by 4s incorporation result in significant changes in the way the s20S interacts with its partners, and dictate its role in germ cell differentiation.",

The purpose of this study is to uncover pharmacological vulnerabilities of BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells, with the goal of identifying new therapeutic options for patients whose tumors have developed resistance to BRAFi/MEKi therapy. We screened a well-annotated compound library against a panel of isogenic pairs of parental and BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines to identify classes of compounds that selectively target BRAFi-resistant cells over their BRAFi-sensitive counterparts. Two distinct patterns of increased sensitivity to classes of pharmacological inhibitors emerged. In two cell line pairs, BRAFi resistance conferred increased sensitivity to compounds that share the property of cell cycle arrest at M-phase, including inhibitors of aurora kinase (AURK), polo-like kinase (PLK), tubulin, and kinesin. Live cell microscopy used to track mitosis in real time revealed that parental, but not BRAFi-resistant, melanoma cells were able to exit from compound-induced mitotic arrest through mitotic slippage, thus escaping death. Consistent with the key role of Cyclin B1 levels in regulating mitosis at the spindle checkpoint, in arrested cells we found higher Cyclin B1 levels in parental over BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells, suggesting that altered Cyclin B1 expression levels may explain why these BRAFi resistant cells have gained increased vulnerability to mitotic inhibitors. Another BRAFi-resistant cell line showed increased sensitivity to Chk1/2 inhibitors, possibly due to an accumulation of DNA damage, resulting in mitotic failure. This study shows that BRAFi-resistance in melanoma cells confers vulnerability to pharmacological disruption of mitosis and suggests a targeted synthetic lethal approach to treat BRAF-mutant melanomas that have become resistant to BRAF/MEK-directed therapies.",

Evidence suggests that RNA aids nucleation of these pathological aggregates; however, the mechanism has not been investigated at the level of atomic structure. Here we present the 3.4 [A] resolution structure of fibrils of full-length recombinant tau protein in the presence of RNA, determined by electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM). The structure reveals the familiar in-register cross-{beta} amyloid scaffold, but with a small fibril core spanning residues Glu391 to Ala426, a region disordered in the fuzzy coat in all previously studied tau polymorphs. RNA is bound on the fibril surface to the positively charged residues Arg406 and His407 and runs parallel to the fibril axis. The fibrils dissolve when RNAse is added, showing that RNA is necessary for fibril integrity. While this structure cannot exist simultaneously with the tau fibril structures extracted from patients brains, it could conceivably account for the nucleating effects of RNA cofactors followed by remodeling as fibrils mature.\n\nSignificance statementApplication of cryoEM has greatly expanded our understanding of atomic structures of mature pathological amyloid fibrils, but little is known at the molecular level of the initiation of fibril formation. RNA has been shown to be one cofactor for formation of fibrils of tau protein, and is known also to bind to other proteins, including TDP-43, FUS, and HNRNPA2, which form pathological inclusions. Our cryoEM structure of recombinant tau protein with RNA reveals a 36 residue, C-terminal fibril core bound to RNA which runs parallel to the fibril axis. We speculate that this structure could represent an early step in the formation of tau fibrils.",

Immune cells are critical responders to muscle injury and guide tissue resident stem cell and progenitor mediated myogenic repair. However, how immune cell infiltration and inter-cellular communication networks with muscle stem cells are altered following VML and drive pathological outcomes remains underexplored. Herein, we contrast the cellular and molecular mechanisms of VML injuries that result in fibrotic degeneration or regeneration of SkM. Following degenerative VML injuries, we observe heightened infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells as well as persistence of neutrophils beyond two weeks post injury. Functional validation of NK cells revealed an antagonistic role on neutrophil accumulation in part via inducing apoptosis and CCR1 mediated chemotaxis. The persistent infiltration of neutrophils in degenerative VML injuries was found to contribute to impairments in muscle stem cell regenerative function, which was also attenuated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF{beta}1). Blocking TGF{beta} signaling reduced neutrophil accumulation and fibrosis, as well as improved muscle specific force. Collectively, these results enhance our understanding of immune cell-stem cell crosstalk that drives regenerative dysfunction and provide further insight into possible avenues for fibrotic therapy exploration.\n\nSINGLE SENTENCE SUMMARYComparison of muscle injuries resulting in regeneration or fibrosis reveals inter-cellular communication between neutrophils and natural killer cells impacts muscle stem cell mediated repair.",

We used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of cells from human breast milk (hBM) across lactational time from 3 to 632 days postpartum in 15 donors. We find that the majority of cells in human breast milk are lactocytes, a specialized epithelial subset, and cell type frequencies shift over the course of lactation yielding greater epithelial diversity at later points. Analysis of lactocytes reveals a continuum of cell states characterized by transcriptional changes in hormone, growth factor, and milk production related pathways. Generalized additive models suggest that one sub-cluster, LALBAlow epithelial cells, increase as a function of time postpartum, daycare attendance, and the use of hormonal birth control. We identify several sub-clusters of macrophages in hBM that are enriched for tolerogenic functions, possibly playing a role in protecting the mammary gland during lactation. Our description of the cellular components of breast milk, their association with maternal-infant dyad metadata and quantification of alterations at the gene and pathways levels provides the first detailed longitudinal picture of human breast milk cells across lactational time. This work paves the way for future investigations of how a potential division of cellular labor and differential hormone regulation might be leveraged therapeutically to support healthy lactation and potentially aid in milk production.",

For instance, bladder cancer shows a 4-fold male-biased incidence that persists after adjustment for known risk factors3,4. Here, we utilize murine bladder cancer models to establish that male-biased tumor burden is driven by sex differences in endogenous T cell immunity. Notably, sex differences exist in early fate decisions by intratumoral CD8+ T cells following their activation. While female CD8+ T cells retain their effector function, male counterparts readily adopt a Tcf1lowTim3- progenitor state that becomes exhausted over tumor progression. Human cancers show an analogous male-biased frequency of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, we describe an opposing interplay between CD8+ T cell intrinsic androgen and type I interferon5,6 signaling in Tcf1/Tcf7 regulation and formation of the progenitor exhausted T cell subset. Consistent with female-biased interferon response7, testosterone-dependent stimulation of Tcf1/Tcf7 and resistance to interferon occurs to a greater magnitude in male CD8+ T cells. Male-biased predisposition for CD8+ T cell exhaustion suggests that spontaneous rejection of early immunogenic bladder tumors is less common in males and carries implications for therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors8,9.",

In the present study, we used Beat AML and GDSC, two comprehensive datasets based on patient-derived and cell line-based samples, to show the potential of multipartite network modeling in cancer combinatorial therapy. We used the median values of cell viability to compare drug potency and reconstruct a weighted bipartite network, which models the interaction of drugs and biological samples. Then, clusters of network communities were identified in two projected networks based on the topological structure of networks. Chemical structures, drug-target networks, protein-protein interactions, and signaling networks were used to corroborate the intra-cluster homogeneity. We further leveraged the community structures within the drug-based multipartite networks to discover effective multi-targeted drug combinations, and the synergy levels which were supported with more evidence using the DrugComb and the ALMANAC databases. Furthermore, we confirmed the potency of selective combinations of drugs against monotherapy in vitro experiment using three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Taken together, this study presents an innovative data-driven strategy based on multipartite networks to suggest potential drug combinations to improve treatment of AML.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Visuospatial learning depends on the parahippocampal place area (PPA), a functionally heterogenous area which current visuospatial processing models place downstream from parietal cortex and only from area V4 of early visual cortex (EVC). However, evidence for anatomical connections between the PPA and other EVC areas is inconsistent, and these connections are not discussed in current models. Through a data-driven analysis based on diffusion MRI tractography, we present evidence that the PPA sits at the confluence of two white matter systems. The first conveys information from the retrosplenial complex to the anterior PPA and runs within the cingulum bundle. The second system connects all peripheral EVC areas to the posterior PPA and corresponds to the medial occipital longitudinal tract (MOLT), a novel white matter pathway distinct from the cingulum. Based on further functional connectivity analysis and meta-analytic data, we propose that the MOLT supports early stage encoding of visuospatial information by allowing direct reciprocal exchange between the PPA and EVC.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The diets of industrialized countries reflect the increasing use of processed foods, often with the introduction of novel food additives. Xanthan gum is a complex polysaccharide with unique rheological properties that have established its use as a widespread stabilizer and thickening agent1. However, little is known about its direct interaction with the gut microbiota, which plays a central role in digestion of other, chemically-distinct dietary fiber polysaccharides. Here, we show that the ability to digest xanthan gum is surprisingly common in industrialized human gut microbiomes and appears to be contingent on the activity of a single bacterium that is a member of an uncultured bacterial genus in the family Ruminococcaceae. We used a combination of enrichment culture, multi-omics, and recombinant enzyme studies to identify and characterize a complete pathway in this uncultured bacterium for the degradation of xanthan gum. Our data reveal that this keystone degrader cleaves the xanthan gum backbone with a novel glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) enzyme before processing the released oligosaccharides using additional enzymes. Surprisingly, some individuals harbor a Bacteroides species that is capable of consuming oligosaccharide products generated by the keystone Ruminococcaceae or a purified form of the GH5 enzyme. This Bacteroides symbiont is equipped with its own distinct enzymatic pathway to cross-feed on xanthan gum breakdown products, which still harbor the native linkage complexity in xanthan gum, but it cannot directly degrade the high molecular weight polymer. Thus, the introduction of a common food additive into the human diet in the past 50 years has promoted the establishment of a food chain involving at least two members of different phyla of gut bacteria.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Spatial models often assume isotropy and stationarity, implying that spatial dependence is direction invariant and uniform throughout the study area. However, these assumptions are violated when dispersal barriers are present in the form of geographical features or disease control interventions. Despite this, the issue of non-stationarity has been little explored in the context of plant health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different barriers in the distribution of the quarantine plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa in the demarcated area in Alicante, Spain. Occurrence data from the official surveys in 2018 were analyzed with four spatial Bayesian hierarchical models: i) a stationary model representing a scenario without any control interventions or geographical features; ii) a model with mountains as physical barriers; iii) a model with a continuous or iv) discontinuous perimeter barrier as control interventions surrounding the infested area. Barriers were assumed to be totally impermeable, so they should be interpreted as areas without host plants and in which it is not possible for infected vectors or propagating plant material to pass through. Inference and prediction were performed through the integrated nested Laplace approximation methodology and the stochastic partial differential equation approach. In the stationary model the posterior mean of the spatial range was 4,030.17 m 95% CI (2,907.41, 5,563.88), meaning that host plants that are closer to an infected plant than this distance would be at risk for X. fastidiosa. This distance can be used to define the buffer zone around the infested area in Alicante. In the non-stationary models, the posterior mean of the spatial range varied from 3,860.88 m 95% CI (2,918.61, 5,212.18) in the mountain barrier model to 6,141.08 m 95% CI (4,296.32, 9,042.99) in the continuous barrier model. Compared with the stationary model, the perimeter barrier models decreased the probability of X. fastidiosa presence in the area outside the barrier. Differences between the discontinuous and continuous barrier models showed that breaks in areas with low sampling intensity resulted in a higher probability of X. fastidiosa presence. These results may help authorities prioritize the areas for surveillance and implementation of control measures.",

Variants in FAN1 clustered in its DNA-binding and nuclease domains and were associated predominantly with earlier onset HD. Nuclease activities of these variants correlated with residual age at motor onset of HD.

Most GWAS-nominated variants lie in noncoding regions, complicating the systematic translation of these findings into functional understanding. Here, we leverage convolutional neural networks to assist in this challenge. Our computational framework, peaBrain, models the transcriptional machinery of a tissue as a two-stage process: first, predicting the mean tissue specific abundance of all genes and second, incorporating the transcriptomic consequences of genotype variation to predict individual abundance on a subject-by-subject basis. We demonstrate that peaBrain accounts for the majority (>50%) of variance observed in mean transcript abundance across most tissues and outperforms regularized linear models in predicting the consequences of individual genotype variation. We highlight the validity of the peaBrain model by calculating non-coding impact scores that correlate with nucleotide evolutionary constraint that are also predictive of disease-associated variation and allele-specific transcription factor binding. We further show how these tissue-specific peaBrain scores can be leveraged to pinpoint functional tissues underlying complex traits, outperforming methods that depend on colocalization of eQTL and GWAS signals. We subsequently derive continuous dense embeddings of genes for downstream applications, and identify putatively functional eQTLs that are missed by high-throughput experimental approaches.",

Here we present a deep learning approach that directly estimates species richness, skipping the step of estimating individual species ranges. We train a neural network model based on species lists from inventory plots, which provide ground truthing for supervised machine learning. The model learns to predict species richness based on spatially associated variables, including climatic and geographic predictors, as well as counts of available species records from online databases. We assess the empirical utility of our approach by producing independently verifiable maps of alpha, beta and gamma plant diversity at high spatial resolutions for Australia, a continent with highly contrasting diversity patterns.

Recent theory emphasises that sexual conflict can be evolutionarily resolved, and complete parental cooperation can occur if parents directly respond ( negotiate) to each other and coordinate their level of care. Despite numerous experiments show that parents are responsive to each other, we still lack empirical evidence of the behavioural mechanisms by which this negotiation occurs. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal coordination of parental provisioning behaviour as a possible mechanism of negotiation over parental care. We deployed an automated radio-tracking technology to track the provisioning activity of wild great tit (Parus major) pairs during chick rearing. Our analyses represent the first detailed spatial and temporal description of foraging coordination in songbird parents in a natural context. We demonstrate that the foraging behaviour of the two parents is highly coordinated in space and time, with parents changing their foraging locations in conjunction with their partners movements. Therefore, foraging coordination could be a mechanism by which parents directly monitor and respond to each others level of investment.",

Macroevolutionary and comparative studies have linked these processes to rapid transcriptomic evolution in sex-specific tissues and substantial transcriptomic postmating responses in females, patterns of which are altered when mating between reproductively isolated species. Here we test multiple predictions arising from sexual selection and conflict theory about the evolution of sex-specific and tissue-specific gene expression and the postmating response at the microevolutionary level. Following over 150 generations of experimental evolution under either reduced (enforced monogamy) or elevated (polyandry) sexual selection in Drosophila pseudoobscura, we found a substantial effect of sexual selection treatment on transcriptomic divergence in virgin male and female reproductive tissues (testes, male accessory glands, the female reproductive tract and ovaries). Sexual selection treatment also had a dominant effect on the postmating response, particularly in the female reproductive tract - the main arena for sexual conflict - compared to ovaries. This affect was asymmetric with monandry females typically showing more postmating responses than polyandry females, with enriched gene functions varying across treatments. The evolutionary history of the male partner had a larger effect on the postmating response of monandry females, but females from both sexual selection treatments showed unique patterns of gene expression and gene function when mating with males from the alternate treatment. Our microevolutionary results mostly confirm comparative macroevolutionary predictions on the role of sexual selection on transcriptomic divergence and altered gene regulation arising from divergent coevolutionary trajectories between sexual selection treatments.",

In S. cerevisiae, the GID E3 ligase regulates the switch from gluconeogenic to glycolytic conditions through induction and incorporation of the substrate receptor subunit Gid4, which promotes the degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes. Here, we show an alternative substrate receptor, Gid10, which is induced in response to changes in temperature, osmolarity and nutrient availability, and regulates the ART-Rsp5 pathway. Art2 levels are elevated upon GID10 deletion, a crystal structure shows the basis for Gid10-Art2 interactions, and Gid10 directs a GID E3 ligase complex to ubiquitinate Art2. We also find that the GID E3 ligase affects the flux of plasma membrane nutrient transporters during heat stress. The data reveal GID as a system of E3 ligases with metabolic regulatory functions outside of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, controlled by distinct stress-specific substrate receptors.",

To address this challenge, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of lung autopsies from 31 patients suffering from severe COVID-19 related complications and 10 uninfected controls. Using a metatranscriptome analysis of lung tissue samples we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant \"classical\" signature (n=23) showed upregulation of unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) potentially representing \"Cytokine Release Syndrome\" (CRS) showed upregulation of cytokines such IL1 and CCL19 but absence of complement activation and muted inflammation. Further, dissecting expression of individual genes within enriched pathways for patient signature suggests heterogeneity in host response to the primary infection. We found that the majority of patients cleared the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but all suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus cohnii in \"classical\" patients and Pasteurella multocida in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients that can be identified through the status of the complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. This information can be used to design personalized therapy to treat COVID-19 related complications corresponding to patient signature such as using the identified drug molecules or mitigating specific secondary infections.",

However, Zuc lacks sequence preference in vitro, pointing towards additional unknown specificity factors. We examined murine piRNAs and revealed a strong and specific enrichment of three sequences (UAA, UAG, UGA)-- corresponding to stop codons--at piRNA 5 ends. Stop codon sequences were also enriched immediately after piRNA processing intermediates, reflecting their Zuc-dependent tail-to-head arrangement. Further analyses revealed that a Zuc in vivo cleavage preference at four sequences (UAA, UAG, UGA, UAC) promotes 5 end stop codons. This observation was conserved across mammals and possibly further. Our work provides new insights into Zuc-dependent cleavage and may point to a previously unrecognized connection between piRNA biogenesis and the translational machinery.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) feedback controllers have been the most widely used controllers in industry for almost a century due to their good performance, simplicity, and ease of tuning. Motivated by their success in various engineering disciplines, PID controllers recently found their way into synthetic biology, where the design of feedback molecular control systems has been identified as an important goal. In this paper, we consider the mathematical realization of PID controllers via biomolecular interactions. We propose an array of topologies that offer a compromise between simplicity and high performance. We first demonstrate that different Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers exhibit different capabilities for enhancing the dynamics and reducing variance (cell-to-cell variability). Next, we introduce several derivative controllers that are realized based on incoherent feedforward loops acting in a feedback configuration. Alternatively, we show that differentiators can be realized by placing molecular integrators in a negative feedback loop--an arrangement that can then be augmented by PI components to yield PID feedback controllers. We demonstrate that the derivative component can be exploited for enhancing system stability, dramatically increasing the molecular control systems dynamic performance, and for reducing the noise effect on the output of interest. The PID controller features are established through various deterministic and stochastic analyses as well as numerical simulations. Finally, we provide an experimental demonstration using a recently developed hybrid setup, the cyberloop, where the controller is implemented in silico to control a biological genetic circuit in vivo. The large array of novel biomolecular PID controllers introduced here forms a basis for the design and construction of advanced high-performance biomolecular control systems that robustly regulate the dynamics of living systems.",

However, it is unclear whether complex chromatin structures exist at sub-kilobase-scale and to what extent fine-scale regulatory interactions depend on loop extrusion. To address these questions, we present an MNase-based chromosome conformation capture (3C) approach, which has enabled us to generate the most detailed local interaction data to date and precisely investigate the effects of cohesin and CTCF depletion on chromatin architecture. Our data reveal that cis-regulatory elements have distinct internal nano-scale structures, within which local insulation is dependent on CTCF, but which are independent of cohesin. In contrast, we find that depletion of cohesin causes a subtle reduction in longer-range enhancer-promoter interactions and that CTCF depletion can cause rewiring of regulatory contacts.

Calorie restriction (CR) is the most potent and reproducible intervention to extend health and lifespan, but is largely unachievable in humans. Therefore, identification of \"CR mimetics\" has received much attention. CR targets nutrient-sensing pathways centering on mTORC1. The mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, has been proposed as a potential CR mimetic and is proven to counteract age-related muscle loss. Therefore, we tested whether rapamycin acts via similar mechanisms as CR to slow muscle aging. Contrary to our expectation, long-term CR and rapamycin-treated geriatric mice display distinct skeletal muscle gene expression profiles despite both conferring benefits to aging skeletal muscle. Furthermore, CR improved muscle integrity in a mouse with nutrient-insensitive sustained muscle mTORC1 activity and rapamycin provided additive benefits to CR in aging mouse muscles. Therefore, RM and CR exert distinct, compounding effects in aging skeletal muscle, opening the possibility of parallel interventions to counteract muscle aging.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent cause of bloodstream infections. Treatment can be challenging, even when isolates appear to be drug susceptible, with high rates of persistent and relapsing infection. This is particularly the case with infections caused by methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, which are resistant to frontline antibiotics. To understand how the host environment influences treatment outcomes in MRSA infections, we studied the impact of human serum on staphylococcal susceptibility to daptomycin, an antibiotic of last resort. This revealed that serum triggered a very high degree of tolerance to daptomycin, as well as several other classes of antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides, including gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, vancomycin, nisin and gramicidin. Serum-induced daptomycin tolerance was due to two independent mechanisms. Firstly, the host defence peptide LL-37 present in serum induced tolerance by triggering the staphylococcal GraRS two component system. This led to increased cell wall accumulation that reduced access of daptomycin to its membrane target. Secondly, GraRS-independent changes to the membrane resulted in increased cardiolipin abundance that also contributed to daptomycin tolerance. When both mechanisms were blocked, serum exposed S. aureus cells were as susceptible to daptomycin as bacteria growing in laboratory media. These data demonstrate that host factors can significantly modulate antibiotic susceptibility via diverse mechanisms, which may in turn contribute to treatment failure. The inhibition of serum-induced cell wall accumulation by fosfomycin reduced tolerance, suggesting that this antibiotic may form a useful combination therapy with daptomycin.",

Upon stimulation by two endogenous neuropeptides, neuromedin U and S (NMU and NMS) with similar binding affinities, NMUR1 and NMUR2 primarily display distinct peripheral tissue and central nervous system (CNS) functions, respectively, due to their distinct tissue distributions. These NMU receptors have triggered extensive attention as drug targets for obesity and immune inflammation. Specifically, selective agonists for NMUR1 in peripheral tissue show promising long-term anti-obesity effects with fewer CNS-related side effects. However, the mechanisms of peptide binding specificity and receptor activation remain elusive due to the lack of NMU receptor structures, which hamper drug design targeting NMU receptors. Here, we report four cryo-electron microscopy structures of Gq chimera-coupled NMUR1 and NMUR2 bound with NMU and NMS. These structures present the conserved overall peptide-binding mode and reveal the mechanism of peptide selectivity for specific NMURs, as well as the common activation mechanism of the NMUR subfamily. Together, these findings provide insights into the molecular basis of the peptide recognition selectivity and offer a new opportunity for designing selective drugs targeting NMURs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The human connectome is the set of physical pathways linking brain regions to one another. Empirical and in silico studies have demonstrated that the structure of this network helps shape patterns of functional coupling between brain regions. To better understand this link between structure and function, a growing number of studies have derived geometric, dynamic, and topological predictors from structural connectivity in order to make predictions about correlation structure. These studies, however, have typically focused on global (whole-brain) predictions using a restricted set of predictors. Here, we investigate a wide range of predictors and shift focus onto predictions of local (regional) patterns of functional coupling. We show that, globally, no individual predictor performs well and, that even the best predictors are largely driven by their ability to predict functional coupling between directly connected regions. We then use the same predictors to make predictions of local coupling and find marked improvement. Notably, the most predictable local FC is linked to sensorimotor regions, which are best predicted by measures based on topological similarity, mean first passage times of random walkers, and the brains embedding in Euclidean space. We then show that by combining the predictive power of more than one predictor using multi-linear models, we can further improve local predictions. Finally, we investigate how global and local structure-function coupling differences across the human lifespan. We find that, globally, the magnitude of coupling decreases with biological age, which is paralleled by an increase in the number of multi-step pathways. We also show that, locally, structure-function coupling is preserved in higher order cognitive systems, but preferentially decreases with age in sensorimotor systems. Our results illuminate the heterogeneous landscape of structure-function coupling across the cerebral cortex and help clarify its differences with age.",

However, little substrate specificity among the many PATs has been determined. Here we describe the inherent partitioning of Go - -subunit of heterotrimeric Go proteins - to PM and Golgi, independent from Golgi-to-PM transport. A minimal code within Go N-terminus governs its compartmentalization and re-coding produces G protein versions with shifted localization. We establish the S-palmitoylation at the outer nuclear membrane assay (\"SwissKASH\") to probe substrate specificity of PATs in intact cells. With this assay, we show that PATs localizing to different membrane compartments display remarkable substrate selectivity, which is the basis for PMP compartmentalization.

The cholera toxin promoter (PctxAB) contains a series of heptad repeats (5-TTTTGAT-3); which have been previously shown to play crucial role in ctxAB transcriptional regulation by recruiting the transcriptional activators ToxT, ToxR, and the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS along the ctx promoter. The numbers of these repeats vary between the two biotypes of V. cholerae O1 strains, and even among strains of the same biotype. In this study, we examined PctxAB activation of V. cholerae O1 pandemic strains to understand the significance of the distal heptad repeats in regulating ctx expression. Interestingly, we found that ctx activation may depend on the number of TTTTGAT heptad repeats within PctxAB, and we posit that the occupation of the distal repeats by H-NS could further prevent transcriptional activation of ctx genes in V. cholerae. We hypothesize that ToxT-dependent transcriptional activation may not require entire displacement of H-NS and propose a revision in the currently accepted model of ToxT dependent PctxAB transcriptional activation.\n\nIMPORTANCECT production by pathogenic V. cholerae O1 strains is regulated through the transcriptional silencing of CTX promoter by H-NS and counter repression by ToxT. The highly AT rich PctxAB is composed of the tandem repeats 5{square} TTTTGAT 3{square}; the numbers of which differ among the classical and El Tor biotypes. However, it is still not very clear whether the numbers of these repeats could be correlated with promoter activation of the ctx operon. Here we report the role of the distal repeats in ctxAB expression levels. We demonstrate that PctxAB activation changes with the number of the heptad repats within the core promoter element, thereby suggesting a model for ctx regulation in the toxigenic strains of V. cholerae.",

Here we asked, using functional MRI, whether subject-level differences in neural excursion from manifold structure can explain differences in learning across participants. We had subjects perform a sensorimotor adaptation task in the MRI scanner on two consecutive days, allowing us to assess their learning performance across days, as well as continuously measure brain activity. We find that the overall neural excursion from manifold activity in both cognitive and sensorimotor brain networks is associated with differences in subjects patterns of learning and relearning across days. These findings suggest that off-manifold activity provides an index of the relative engagement of different neural systems during learning, and that intersubject differences in patterns of learning and relearning across days are related to reconfiguration processes in cognitive and sensorimotor networks during learning.",

We demonstrate the utility of spicyR by applying it to a type 1 diabetes imaging mass cytometry dataset, revealing changes in cellular associations that were relevant to the disease progression. Ultimately, spicyR allows changes in cellular environments to be explored under different pathologies or disease states.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationR package freely available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/spicyR.html and shiny app implementation at http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/spicyR/\n\nContactellis.patrick@sydney.edu.au\n\nSupplementary informationCode for reproducing key figures available at https://github.com/nickcee/spicyRPaper.",

    "preprint_abstract": "ATP at millimolar levels has recently been implicated in the solubilization of cellular proteins. However, the significance of this high ATP level under physiological conditions and the mechanisms that maintain ATP remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adenylate kinase (ADK) cooperated to maintain cellular ATP levels regardless of glucose levels. Single cell imaging of ATP-reduced yeast mutants revealed that ATP levels in these mutants repeatedly underwent stochastic and transient depletion, which induced the cytotoxic aggregation of endogenous proteins and pathogenic proteins, such as huntingtin and -synuclein. Moreover, pharmacological elevations in ATP levels in an ATP-reduced mutant prevented the accumulation of -synuclein aggregates and its cytotoxicity. The removal of cytotoxic aggregates depended on proteasomes, and proteasomal activity cooperated with AMPK or ADK to resist proteotoxic stresses. The present study is the first to demonstrate that cellular ATP homeostasis ensures proteostasis and revealed that suppressing the high volatility of cellular ATP levels prevented cytotoxic protein aggregation, implying that AMPK and ADK are important factors that prevent proteinopathies, such as neurodegenerative diseases.",

How cell cycle progression affects migration, and vice-versa, remains largely unknown. We address these questions by combining in silico modelling and in vivo experimentation in the zebrafish Trunk Neural Crest (TNC). TNC migrate collectively, forming chains with a leader cell directing the movement of trailing followers. We show that the acquisition of migratory identity is autonomously controlled by Notch signalling in TNC. High Notch activity defines leaders, while low Notch determines followers. Moreover, cell cycle progression is required for TNC migration and is regulated by Notch. Cells with low Notch activity stay longer in G1 and become followers, while leaders with high Notch activity quickly undergo G1/S transition and remain in S-phase longer. We propose that migratory behaviours are defined through the interaction of Notch signalling and cell cycle progression.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Genome duplication begins at many epigenetically determined sites by pre-replication, pre-initiation, and replisome complexes; co-expression of their components must be optimally timed for S phase to occur. Oscillations of cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) and regulator cyclins control cell cycling, many are pharmacological targets in cancer. This study examines gene expression relationships between drivers, cell cycle components, and a subset of proliferation genes in colon (COAD) and lung (LUAD) adenocarcinomas. Several known drivers of COAD and LUAD including APC, CTNNB1, KRAS, MYC, Braf, TP53, Rb1, and EGFR are also observed with focus on Wnt and MAPK signaling activation. Wnt signaling activation has relevance for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, as it provides cancer cells with escape mechanisms.\n\nMYC and KRAS co-expressed directly with far fewer proliferation genes in LUAD than COAD, suggesting their expression is ectopic to S phase in lung tumors. APC indirectly co-expressed with the same factors in both COAD and LUAD, but was found co-expressed indirectly with MYC and mutated only in COAD. Other Wnt signaling components also co-expressed in low MYC context in COAD, had significantly higher mutation frequencies. These data suggest Wnt signaling activation to be the indirect result of decreased MYC availability in COAD, and ectopic overexpression of MYC in LUAD. Cyclins CCNH, CCNC, and CCNK, co-expressed with far fewer proliferation genes in LUAD. Conversely, Braf had direct co-expression with many proliferation factors in non EGFR activated LUAD. Proliferation in EGFR activated LUAD was completely deregulated with E2F(s) 4/5/6 expression, potentially explaining their low proliferative ability.",

Use of photocrosslinking methods has been pursued to covalently capture glycan-dependent interactions in situ however use of metabolic glycan engineering methods to incorporate photocrosslinking sugar analogs is limited to certain cell types. Here we report an exo-enzymatic labeling method to add a diazirine-modified sialic acid (SiaDAz) to cell surface glycoconjugates. The method involves chemoenzymatic synthesis of diazirine-modified CMP-sialic acid (CMP-SiaDAz), followed by sialyltransferase-catalyzed addition of SiaDAz to desialylated cell surfaces. Cell surface SiaDAz-ylation is compatible with multiple cell types and is facilitated by endogenous extracellular sialyltransferase activity present in Daudi B cells. This method for extracellular addition of 2-6-linked SiaDAz enables UV-induced crosslinking of CD22, demonstrating the utility for covalent capture of glycan-mediated binding interactions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The study of brain network connectivity as a time-varying property began relatively recently and to date has remained primarily concerned with capturing a handful of discrete static states that characterize connectivity as measured on a timescale shorter than that of the full scan. Capturing group-level representations of temporally evolving patterns of connectivity is a challenging and important next step in fully leveraging the information available in large resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies. We introduce a flexible, extensible data-driven framework for the stable identification of group-level multiframe (movie-style) dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) states. Our approach employs uniform manifold approximation and embedding (UMAP) to produce a continuity-preserving planar embedding of high-dimensional time-varying measurements of whole-brain functional network connectivity. Planar linear exemplars summarizing dominant dynamic trends across the population are computed from local linear approximations to the 2D embedded trajectories. A high-dimensional representation of each 2D exemplar segment is obtained by averaging the dFNC observations corresponding to the n planar nearest neighbors of {tau} evenly spaced points along the 2D line segment representation (where n is the UMAP number-of-neighbors parameter and {tau} is the temporal duration of trajectory segments being approximated). Each of the 2D exemplars thus \"lifts\" to a multiframe high-dimensional dFNC trajectory of length {tau}. The collection of high-dimensional temporally evolving dFNC representations (EVOdFNCs) derived in this manner are employed as dynamic basis objects with which to characterize observed high-dimensional dFNC trajectories, which are then expressed as weighted combination of these basis objects. Our approach yields new insights into anomalous patterns of fluidly varying whole brain connectivity that are significantly associated with schizophrenia as a broad diagnosis as well as with certain symptoms of this serious disorder. Importantly, we show that relative to conventional hidden Markov modeling with single-frame unvarying dFNC summary states, EVOdFNCs are more sensitive to positive symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations and delusions, suggesting a more dynamic characterization is needed to help illuminate such a complex brain disorder.",

Alismatales is the largest clade of aquatic angiosperms including all marine angiosperms, as well as terrestrial plants. We used Alismatales to explore plant adaptation to aquatic environments by analyzing a data set that included 95 samples (89 Alismatales species) covering four genomes and 91 transcriptomes (59 generated in this study). To provide a basis for investigating adaptation, we assessed phylogenetic conflict and whole-genome duplication (WGD) events in Alismatales. We recovered a relationship for the three main clades in Alismatales as (Tofieldiaceae, Araceae) + core Alismatids. We also found phylogenetic conflict among the backbone of the three main clades that could be explained by incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. Overall, we identified 18 putative WGD events across Alismatales. One of them occurred at the most recent common ancestor of core Alismatids, and three occurred at seagrass lineages. We also found that lineage and life-form were both important for different evolutionary patterns for the genes related to freshwater and marine adaptation. For example, several light or ethylene-related genes were lost in the seagrass Zosteraceae, but are present in other seagrasses and freshwater species. Stomata-related genes were lost in both submersed freshwater species and seagrasses. Nicotianamine synthase genes, which are important in iron intake, expanded in both submersed freshwater species and seagrasses. Our results advance the understanding of the adaptation to aquatic environments and whole-genome duplications using phylogenomics.",

This plasma cell percentage is often determined by visual estimation of CD138-stained bone marrow biopsies and clot sections. While not necessarily inaccurate, estimates are by definition imprecise. For this study, we hypothesized that deep learning can be used to improve precision.\n\nMethodsWe trained a semantic segmentation-based convolutional neural network (CNN) using annotations of CD138+ and CD138- cells provided by one pathologist on small image patches of bone marrow and validated the CNN on an independent test set of images patches using annotations from two pathologists and a non-deep-learning commercial software. Once satisfied with performance, we scaled-up the CNN to evaluate whole slide images (WSIs), and deployed the system as a workflow friendly web application to measure plasma cell percentages using snapshots taken from microscope cameras.\n\nResultsOn validation image patches, we found that the intraclass correlation coefficients for plasma cell percentages between the CNN and pathologist #1, a non-deep learning commercial software and pathologist #1, and pathologists #1 and #2 were 0.975, 0.892, and 0.994, respectively. The overall results show that CNN labels were almost as accurate pathologist labels at a cell-by-cell level. On WSIs from 10 clinical cases, the CNN continued to perform well, and identified two cases where the sign-out pathologist overestimated plasma cell percentages.\n\nConclusionsThe high labeling accuracy of the CNN supports its eventually application as a computational second-opinion tool for the measurement of plasma cell percentages in clinical practice.",

DTT may potentially impact cellular physiology by ER-independent mechanisms; however, such mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans, here we show that DTT toxicity is modulated by the bacterial diet. Specifically, the dietary component vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity in a methionine synthase-dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we discover that loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, confers DTT resistance. DTT upregulates R08E5.3 expression and modulates the activity of the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Employing genetic studies, we establish that DTT toxicity is a result of the depletion of SAM. Finally, we show that a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 unfolded protein response pathway is required to counteract toxicity at high, but not low, DTT concentrations.",

Here we systematically studied the role of intracellular PslG, a glycosyl hydrolase that is co-transcribed with 15 psl genes, which is responsible for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide Psl (ePsl), a key biofilm matrix polysaccharide in opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We showed that lacking of PslG in this opportunistic pathogen alters the signaling function and structure of ePsl, changes the relative level of cyclic-di-GMP within daughter cells during cell division and shapes the localization of ePsl on bacterial periphery, thus results in long chains of bacterial cells, fast-forming and compact biofilm microcolonies.

Using viral-genetic approaches, here we establish hypothalamic oxytocin neurons as key regulators of parental caregiving behaviors of male mice. We then used rabies virus-mediated unbiased screen to identify excitatory neural connections originating from the lateral hypothalamus to the oxytocin neurons to be drastically strengthened when male mice become fathers.

    "preprint_abstract": "pH regulates protein function and interactions by altering the charge of individual residues causing the loss or gain of intra-molecular non-covalent bonds, which may additionally lead to structural rearrangements. While tools to analyze residue-specific charge distribution of protein sequences and structures at a given pH exist, currently no tool is available to investigate non-covalent bond changes at two different pH values. In an effort to make protein pH sensitivity analysis more accessible to researchers without computational structural biology background, we developed patcHwork, a web server that combines the identification of amino acids undergoing a charge shift with the determination of affected non-covalent bonds at two user-defined pH values. At the sequence-only level, patcHwork applies the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine pH-sensitive residues. When the 3D protein structure is available, patcHwork can be employed to gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of the effect of pH on a protein of interest. This is achieved using the PDB2PQR and PROPKA tools and non-covalent bond determination algorithms. A user-friendly interface allows visualizing pH-sensitive residues as well as affected salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and aromatic (pi-pi and cation-pi) interactions. Importantly, patcHwork can be used to identify patches, a new concept we propose of pH-sensitive residues in close proximity on the protein structure, which may have a major impact on function. We demonstrate the attractiveness of patcHwork studying experimentally investigated pH-sensitive proteins.

To address this gap, we sought to map the genomic location of the self-recognition locus (S-locus) in this species.\nC_LIO_LIWe used a biparental population and genotyping-by-sequencing to create the first genetic linkage map for this species. Then we developed a novel crossing scheme and set of analysis methods in order to infer S-locus genotypes for a subset of these individuals, allowing us to map the trait. Finally, we identified potential gene candidates using synteny analysis with the annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genome.\nC_LIO_LIOur linkage map contains 198 SNP markers and resolved into the correct number of linkage groups. We were able to successfully map the S-locus and identify several potential gene candidates in the sunflower syntenic region.\nC_LIO_LIOur method is effective and efficient, allowed us to map the S. integrifolium S-locus using fewer resources than previous studies, and could be readily be applied to other species.

    "preprint_abstract": "Changes in distribution of associated molecular targets have been reported across several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the high-resolution topology of most proteins is unknown and simultaneous in vivo measurement in multi-receptor systems is complicated. To account for the missing proteomic information, mRNA transcripts are typically used as a surrogate. Nonetheless, post-transcriptional and post-translational processes might cause the discrepancy between the final distribution of proteins and gene expression patterns. Therefore, this study aims to investigate ex vivo links between mRNA expression and corresponding receptor density in the human cerebral cortex.\n\nTo this end, autoradiography data on the density of 15 different receptors in 38 brain regions were correlated with the expression patterns of 50 associated genes derived from microarray data (mA), RNA sequencing data (RNA-Seq) provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas and predicted mRNA expression patterns (pred-mRNA). Spearmans rank correlation was used to evaluate the possible links between proteomic data and mRNA expression patterns.\n\nCorrelations between mRNA and protein density varied greatly between targets: Positive associations were found for e.g. the serotonin 1A (pred-mRNA: rs = 0.708; mA: rs = 0.601) or kainate receptor (pred-mRNA: rs = 0.655; mA: rs = 0.601; RNA-Seq: rs = 0.575), while most of the investigated target receptors showed low or negative correlations.\n\nThe high variability in the correspondence of mRNA expression and receptor warrants caution when inferring the topology of molecular targets in the brain from transcriptome data. This highlights the longstanding value of molecular imaging data and the need for comprehensive proteomic data.",

Therefore, deciphering its role in cardiac physiology and physiopathology is mandatory.\n\nObjectiveThe aim of this study is to provide a phenotypic, electrophysiological and pharmacological characterization of the mouse ICNS, which is still poorly characterized.\n\nMethodsGlobal cardiac innervation and phenotypic diversity were investigated using immunohistochemistry on cleared murine heart and on tissue sections. Patch clamp technique was used for electrophysiological and pharmacological characterization of isolated mouse intracardiac neurons.\n\nResultsWe have identified the expression of seven distinct neuronal markers within mouse ICNS, thus proving the neurochemical diversity of this network. Of note, it was the first time that the existence of neurons expressing the calcium binding protein calbindin, the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the cocain and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptide, was described in the mouse. Electrophysiological studies also revealed the existence of four different neuronal populations based on their electrical behavior. Finally, we showed that these neurons can be modulated by several neuromodulators.\n\nConclusionThis study showed that mouse ICNS presents a molecular and functional complexity similar to other species, and is therefore a suitable model to decipher the role of individual neuronal subtypes regarding the modulation of cardiac function and the initiation of cardiac arrhythmias.",

Here, we investigated the suture strings of 138 snap bean accessions across two years. A total of 3.66 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained by deep resequencing. Based on these SNPs, we identified a strong association signal on Chr02 and a promising candidate gene, PvGUX1_1. Further analysis revealed that the 2-bp deletion in exon of PvGUX1_1 was significantly associated with stringlessness. Comparative mapping indicated that PvGUX1_1 was a domesticated locus and diverged from PvGUX1_2 during an early stage.

    "preprint_abstract": "The properties of random Boolean networks as models of gene regulation have been investigated extensively by the statistical physics community. In the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the reconstruction and analysis of Boolean models of biological networks. In such models, neither network topology nor Boolean functions (or logical update rules) should be expected to be random. In this contribution, we focus on biologically meaningful types of Boolean functions, and perform a systematic study of their preponderance in gene regulatory networks. By applying the k[P] classification based on number of inputs k and bias P of functions, we find that most Boolean functions astonishingly have odd bias in a reference biological dataset of 2687 functions compiled from published models. Subsequently, we are able to explain this observation along with the enrichment of read-once functions (RoFs) and its subset, nested canalyzing functions (NCFs), in the reference dataset in terms of two complexity measures: Boolean complexity based on string lengths in formal logic which is yet unexplored in the biological context, and the average sensitivity. Minimizing the Boolean complexity naturally sifts out a subset of odd-biased Boolean functions which happen to be the RoFs. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that NCFs minimize not only the Boolean complexity, but also the average sensitivity in their k[P] set.",

Phage therapy has been widely applied, for example, using phages to kill bacteria to treat pathogenic and resistant bacterial infections. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective tools for the fast and accurate identification of prophages. Here, we introduce DBSCAN-SWA, a command line software tool developed to predict prophage regions of bacterial genomes. DBSCAN-SWA runs faster than any previous tool. Importantly, it has great detection power based on analysis using 184 manually curated prophages, with a recall of 85% compared with Phage_Finder (63%), VirSorter (74%) and PHASTER (82%) for raw DNA sequences. DBSCAN-SWA also provides user-friendly visualizations including a circular prophage viewer and interactive DataTables.\n\nAvailability and implementationDBSCAN-SWA is implemented in Python3 and is freely available under an open source GPLv2 license from https://github.com/HIT-ImmunologyLab/DBSCAN-SWA/.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Okur-Chung Neurodevelopmental Syndrome (OCNDS) is caused by heterozygous mutations to the CSNK2A1 gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of casein kinase II (CK2). The most frequently occurring mutation is lysine 198 to arginine (K198R). To investigate the impact of this mutation, we first generated a high-resolution phosphorylation motif of CK2WT, including the first characterization of specificity for tyrosine phosphorylation activity. A second high resolution motif representing CK2K198R substrate specificity was also generated. Here we report for the first time the impact of the OCNDS associated CK2K198R mutation. Contrary to prior speculation, the mutation does not result in a loss of function, but rather shifts the substrate specificity of the kinase. Broadly speaking the mutation leads to 1) a decreased preference for acidic residues in the +1 position, 2) a decreased preference for threonine phosphorylation, 3) an increased preference for tyrosine phosphorylation, and 4) an alteration of the tyrosine phosphorylation specificity motif. To further investigate the result of this mutation we have developed a probability-based scoring method, allowing us to predict shifts in phosphorylation in the K198R mutant relative to the wild type kinase. As an initial step we have applied the methodology to the set of axonally localized ion channels in an effort to uncover potential alterations of the phosphoproteome associated with the OCNDS disease condition.",

Here, we show that in the developing Drosophila ovary, canonical Wnt signaling promotes the formation of somatic escort cells (ECs) and their protrusions, which establish a physical permeability barrier to define morphogen territories for proper germ cell differentiation. The protrusions shield germ cells from Dpp and Wingless morphogens produced by the germline stem cell (GSC) niche and normally only received by GSCs. Genetic disruption of EC protrusions allows GSC progeny to also receive Dpp and Wingless, which subsequently disrupt germ cell differentiation. Our results reveal a role for canonical Wnt signaling in specifying the ovarian somatic cells necessary for germ cell differentiation. Additionally, we demonstrate the morphogen-limiting function of this physical permeability barrier, which may be a common mechanism in other organs across species.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Actinobacteria belonging to the genus Amycolatopsis are important for antibiotic production and other valuable biotechnological applications such as biodegradation or bioconversion. Despite their industrial importance, tools and methods for the genetic manipulation of Amycolatopsis are less developed than in other actinobacteria such as Streptomyces. Moreover, most of the existing methods do not support convenient marker-free genome engineering. Here, we report the use of the pSAM2 site-specific recombination system for the efficient deletion of marker genes or large DNA regions in Amycolatopsis. For this purpose, we constructed a shuttle vector, replicating in Escherichia coli and Amycolatopsis, expressing the Xis and Int proteins from the Streptomyces integrative and conjugative element pSAM2. These proteins are sufficient for site-specific recombination between the attachment sites attL and attR. We also constructed two plasmids, replicative in E. coli but not in Amycolatopsis, for the integration of the recombination sites attL and attR on each side of a region targeted for deletion. We exemplified the use of these tools in Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM 40773 by obtaining with high efficiency (>95%) a marker-free deletion of one single gene in the rifamycin biosynthetic gene cluster or of the entire 90-kb cluster.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe genus Amycolatopsis is regarded as an important source of diverse specialized metabolites. Members of this genus are used in industry for the production of valuable antibiotics such as rifamycins or vancomycin. Amycolatopsis spp. also present a great interest for biotechnological applications such as biodegradation or bioconversion. Despite their importance, their genetic manipulation was somehow hampered by the lack of efficient tools. Here we report the successful use of the pSAM2 site-specific recombination system to construct unmarked deletion mutants, allowing marker recycling, or to create large deletions in A. mediterranei DSM 40773. The high efficiency of this site-specific recombination system and it possible application to other Amycolatopsis species open new opportunities for marker-free genome engineering in this genus.",

While structural imaging does not directly map task activation, we hypothesized that structural imaging contains information that can accurately predict variations in task activation between individuals. To this end, we trained a convolutional neural network to use structural imaging (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion tensor imaging) to predict 47 different functional MRI task activation volumes across seven task domains. The U-Net model was trained on 654 subjects and then subsequently tested on 122 unrelated subjects. The predicted activation maps correlated more strongly with their actual maps than with the maps of the other test subjects. An ablation study revealed that a model using the shape of the cortex alone or the shape of the subcortical matter alone was sufficient to predict individual-level differences in task activation maps, but a model using the shape of the whole brain resulted in markedly decreased performance. The ablation study also showed that the additional information provided by the T2-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging strengthened the predictions as compared to using the T1-weighted imaging alone. These results indicate that structural imaging contains information that is predictive of inter-subject variability in task activation mapping and cortical folding patterns as well as microstructural features may be a key component to linking brain structure to brain function.",

Listeners performed an auditory syllable pitch-discrimination task and received retro-active cues to selectively attend to a to-be-probed syllable in memory. Accompanied by increased neural activation in fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks, valid retro-cues yielded faster and more perceptually sensitive responses in recalling acoustic detail of memorized syllables. Information about the cued auditory object was decodable from hemodynamic response patterns in superior temporal sulcus (STS), fronto-parietal, and sensorimotor regions.

One-week hyperoxia (HYX) exposure of newborn mice leads to a permanent arrest in alveologenesis. To test the role of Fgf10 signaling to promote de novo alveologenesis following hyperoxia, we used transgenic mice allowing inducible expression of Fgf10 and recombinant FGF10 (rFGF10) protein delivered intraperitoneally. We carried out morphometry analysis, and IF on day 45. Alveolospheres assays were performed co-culturing AT2s from normoxia (NOX) with FACS-isolated Sca1Pos resident mesenchymal cells (rMC) from animals exposed to NOX, HYX+PBS, or HYX+FGF10. scRNAseq between rMC-Sca1Pos isolated from NOX and HYX+PBS were also carried out. Transgenic overexpression of Fgf10 and rFGF10 administration rescued the alveologenesis defects following HYX. Alveolosphere assays indicate that the activity of rMC-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by HYX and partially rescued by rFGF10 treatment. Analysis by IF demonstrates a significant impact of rFGF10 on the activity of resident mesenchymal cells. scRNAseq results identified clusters expressing Fgf10, Fgf7, Pdgfra, and Axin2, which could represent the rMC niche cells for the AT2 stem cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that rFGF10 administration is able to induce de-novo alveologenesis in a BPD mouse model and identified subpopulations of rMC-Sca1Pos niche cells potentially representing its cellular target.",

    "preprint_abstract": "African swine fever virus (ASFV), a large and complex cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA virus, has developed multiple strategies to evade the antiviral innate immune responses. Cytosolic DNA arising from invading ASFV is mainly detected by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and then triggers a series of innate immune responses to prevent virus invasion. However, the immune escape mechanism of ASFV remains to be fully clarified. The pS273R of ASFV is a member of the SUMO-1-specific protease family and is crucial for valid virus replication. In this study, we identified pS273R as a suppressor of cGAS-STING pathway mediated type I interferon (IFN) production by ASFV genomic open reading frame screening. The pS273R was further confirmed as an inhibitor of IFN production as well as its downstream antiviral genes in cGAS-STING pathway. Mechanistically, pS273R greatly decreased the cGAS-STING signaling by targeting IKK{varepsilon} but not TBK1 and pS273R was found to disturb the interaction between IKK{varepsilon} and STING through its interaction with IKK{varepsilon}. Further, mutational analyses revealed that pS273R antagonized the cGAS-STING pathway by enzyme catalytic activity, which may affect the IKK{varepsilon} sumoylation state required for the interaction with STING. In summary, our results revealed for the first time that pS273R acts as an obvious negative regulator of cGAS-STING pathway by targeting IKK{varepsilon} via its enzymatic activity, which shows a new immune evasion mechanism of ASFV.\n\nImportanceAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a devastating disease for domestic pigs and wild boar and the pathogen ASFV is a cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA virus. The innate immune cGAS-STING-IFN signaling pathway exerts a critical role in sensing ASFV infection. However, the functions of half ASFV encoded 150 plus proteins are still unknown and the evasion against the cGAS-STING pathway is not resolved. In our study, via ASFV genomic open reading frame (ORF) screening, we found that 29 ASFV proteins could inhibit cGAS-STING signaling pathway, with pS273R showing the most obvious inhibitory effect. Surprisingly, pS273R was found to antagonize the cGAS-STING signaling by targeting IKK{varepsilon}. Moreover, the pS273R enzyme activity is required for its ability to inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway. Our findings deepen the understanding of the immune evasion mechanism of ASFV, which will provide a support for the development of safe and effective ASFV vaccines.",

    "preprint_abstract": "1Given the many small-effect loci uncovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic scores have become central to the drive for genomic medicine and have spread into various areas including evolutionary studies of adaptation. While promising, these scores are fraught with issues of portability across populations, due to mis-estimated effect sizes and missing causal loci across populations unrepresented in large-scale GWAS. The poor portability of polygenic scores at first seems at odds with the view that much of common genetic variation is shared among populations. Here we investigate one potential cause of this discrepancy, stabilizing selection on complex traits. Somewhat counter-intuitively, while stabilizing selection to the same optimum phenotype leads to lower phenotypic differentiation among populations, it increases genetic differentiation at GWAS loci because it accelerates the turnover of polymorphisms underlying trait variation within populations. We develop theory to show how stabilizing selection impacts the utility of polygenic scores when applied to unrepresented populations. Specifically, we quantify their reduced prediction accuracy and find they can substantially overstate average genetic differences of phenotypes among populations. Our work emphasizes stabilizing selection to the same optimum as a useful null evolutionary model to draw connections between patterns of allele frequency and polygenic score differentiation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Detection of RNA spots in single molecule FISH microscopy images remains a difficult task especially when applied to large volumes of data. The small size of RNA spots combined with high noise level of images often requires a manual adaptation of the spot detection thresholds for each image. In this work we introduce DeepSpot, a Deep Learning based tool specifically designed to enhance RNA spots which enables spot detection without need to resort to image per image parameter tuning. We show how our method can enable the downstream accurate detection of spots. The architecture of DeepSpot is inspired by small object detection approaches. It incorporates dilated convolutions into a module specifically designed for the Context Aggregation for Small Object (CASO) and uses Residual Convolutions to propagate this information along the network. This enables DeepSpot to enhance all RNA spots to the same intensity and thus circumvents the need for parameter tuning. We evaluated how easily spots can be detected in images enhanced by our method, by training DeepSpot on 20 simulated and 1 experimental datasets, and have shown that more than 97% accuracy is achieved. Moreover, comparison with alternative deep learning approaches for mRNA spot detection (deepBlink) indicated that DeepSpot allows more precise mRNA detection. In addition, we generated smFISH images from mouse fibroblasts in a wound healing assay to evaluate whether DeepSpot enhancement can enable seamless mRNA spot detection and thus streamline studies of localized mRNA expression in cells.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundIn pigs, the ratio between lean mass and fat mass in the carcass determines production efficiency and is strongly influenced by the number and size of cells in tissues. During growth, the increase in the number of cells results from the recruitment of different populations of multipotent mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) residing in the tissues. We hypothesized that the impact of hygiene of housing conditions during growth on the proportions of MSCs in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle may differ between pigs with different residual feed intake (RFI), a measure of feed efficiency.\n\nMethodsAt the age of 12 weeks, Large White pigs from two lines divergently selected for low and high RFI were housed in two contrasting hygiene conditions (good vs poor). After six weeks, pigs were slaughtered (n = 30; 5-9/group). Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue and longissimus skeletal muscle were collected, and cells from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which includes mesenchymal stromal/stem cell populations, were isolated from each tissue. Adipose and muscle cell populations from the SVF were phenotyped by flow cytometry using antibodies that targeted different cell surface markers (CD45 to separate hematopoietic cells from MSCs; CD34, CD38, CD56 and CD140a to identify MSC populations with adipogenic and/or myogenic potential).\n\nResultsAdipose tissue and muscle shared some common MSC populations although MSC diversity was higher in muscle than in adipose tissue. In muscle, the CD45-CD56+CD34-CD140a+ and CD45-CD56+CD34+CD140a+ cell populations were abundant. Of these two cell populations, only the proportions of CD45-CD56+CD34+CD140a+ cells increased (P < 0.05) in pigs housed in poor hygiene as compared with pigs in good hygiene conditions. For the CD45-CD56-CD34- cell population, present in low proportion, there was an interaction between hygiene condition and genetic line (P < 0.05) with a decrease in low RFI pigs housed in poor hygiene conditions. In adipose tissue, the two abundant MSC populations were CD45-CD56-CD34- and CD45-CD56+CD34-. The proportion of CD45-CD56-CD34- cells increased (P < 0.05) whereas the proportion of CD45-CD56+CD34- tended to decrease (P < 0.1) in pigs housed in poor conditions. This study shows that the proportions of some MSC populations were affected by hygiene of housing conditions in a tissue-dependent manner in pigs of both RFI lines. It suggests that MSCs may play a significant role in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle homeostasis and may influence later growth and body composition in growing animals.",

UPR activates autophagy enabling the degradation of misfolded/unfolded proteins. More recently, ER-specific autophagy has been implicated in the removal of damaged ER and restoration of ER-homeostasis. Our investigations reveal that during hypoxia induced ER-stress, the ER-phagy receptor FAM134B targets damaged portions of ER into autophagosomes to restore ER-homeostasis in cancer cells. Loss of FAM134B in breast cancer cells results in increased ER-stress and reduced cell proliferation. Mechanistically, upon sensing hypoxia activated proteotoxic stress, the ER chaperone BiP forms a complex with FAM134B and promotes ER-phagy. Our studies have further led to the identification of a pharmacological agent vitexin that disrupts FAM134B-BiP complex thereby inhibits ER-phagy and suppresses breast cancer progression in vivo.",

For the 2Comp model, the diffusion coefficients (Df, Ds) and volume fractions (Ff, Fs, Ff=1-Fs) of the fast and slow compartments were estimated. For the DKm model, estimates of the diffusion kurtosis (K) and corrected diffusion coefficient (D) were obtained.\n\nResultsFor the 2Comp model, Ds and Fs showed clear differences between AQP4-expressing and non-expressing cells. Fs was also sensitive to cell density. There was no clear relationship with the cell type for the DKm parameters.\n\nConclusionsChanges to cell membrane water permeability due to AQP4 expression affected DWI of cell suspensions.

    "preprint_abstract": "Torpor is a naturally occurring, hypometabolic, hypothermic state engaged by a wide range of animals in response to imbalance between the supply and demand for nutrients. Recent work has identified some of the key neuronal populations involved in daily torpor induction in mice, in particular projections from the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). The DMH plays a role in thermoregulation, control of energy expenditure, and circadian rhythms, making it well positioned to contribute to the expression of torpor. We used activity dependent genetic TRAPing techniques to target DMH neurons that were active during natural torpor bouts in female mice. Chemogenetic reactivation of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons in calorie-restricted mice promoted torpor, resulting in longer and deeper torpor bouts. Chemogenetic inhibition of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons did not block torpor entry, suggesting a modulatory role for the DMH in the control of torpor. This work adds to the evidence that the POA and the DMH form part of a circuit within the mouse hypothalamus that controls entry into daily torpor.\n\nSignificanceDaily heterotherms such as mice employ torpor to cope with environments in which the supply of metabolic fuel is not sufficient for the maintenance of normothermia. Daily torpor involves reductions in body temperature, as well as active suppression of heart rate and metabolism. How the central nervous system controls this profound deviation from normal homeostasis is not known, but a projection from the preoptic area to the dorsomedial hypothalamus has recently been implicated. We demonstrate that the dorsomedial hypothalamus contains neurons that are active during torpor. Activity in these neurons promotes torpor entry and maintenance, but their activation alone does not appear to be sufficient for torpor entry.",

Recently, we have shown that mice can discriminate odour stimuli based on their temporal structure, indicating that information present in the temporal structure of odour plumes may be extracted by the mouse olfactory system. Here using in vivo electrophysiological recordings, we show that mitral and tufted cells (M/TCs), the projection neurons of the mouse olfactory bulb, can encode the dominant temporal frequencies present in odour stimuli up to frequencies of at least 20 Hz. We show that M/TCs couple their membrane potential to odour concentration fluctuations; coupling was variable between M/TCs but independent of the odour presented and with TCs displaying slightly elevated coupling compared to MCs in particular for higher frequency stimulation (20Hz). Pharmacologically blocking the inhibitory circuitry strongly modulated frequency coupling. Together this suggests that both cellular and circuit properties contribute to the encoding of temporal odour features in the mouse olfactory bulb.",

However, roles of the E-Syt family members in PM lipid organisation remain unclear. Among the E-Syt family, the yeast tricalbin (Tcb) proteins are essential for PM integrity upon heat stress, but it is not known how they contribute to PM maintenance. Using quantitative lipidomics and microscopy, we find that the Tcb proteins regulate phosphatidylserine homeostasis at the PM. Moreover, upon heat-induced membrane stress, Tcb3 co-localises with the PM protein Sfk1 that is implicated in PM phospholipid asymmetry and integrity. The Tcb proteins also promote the recruitment of Pkh1, a stress-activated protein kinase required for PM integrity. Phosphatidylserine has evolutionarily conserved roles in PM organisation, integrity, and repair. We suggest that phospholipid regulation is an ancient essential function of E-Syt family members in PM integrity.",

We reveal, further, that loss of each of the four-known lamin isoforms in the mouse embryonic fibroblasts differentially affects cortical and cytoplasmic stiffness as well as cellular contractility, and then propose a LINC complex mediated model that explains these impaired mechanical phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of each lamin isoform softens the nucleus in a manner that correlates with loss of heterochromatin.

How they age, including the exact timing, extent, physiological relevance, and the nature of age-related changes, remains incompletely understood. We used time-stamping to indelibly mark cohorts of newly generated naive T cells (a.k.a. recent thymic emigrants - RTE) in mice, and followed their presence, phenotype and retention in SLO. We found that SLO involute asynchronously. Skin-draining lymph nodes (LN) atrophied early (6-9 months) in life and deeper tissue-draining LN and the spleen late (18-20 months), as measured by the loss of both TN numbers and the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network. Time-stamped RTE cohorts of all ages entered SLO and successfully completed post-thymic differentiation. However, in older mice, these cells were poorly retained, and those found in SLO exhibited an emigration phenotype (CCR7loS1P1hi). Transfers of adult RTE into recipients of different ages formally demonstrated that the defect segregates with the age of the SLO microenvironment and not with the age of T cells. Finally, upon intradermal immunization, RTE generated in mice as early as 6-7 months of age barely participated in de novo immune responses and failed to produce well-armed effector cells. These results highlight changes in structure and function of superficial secondary lymphoid organs in laboratory mice that are earlier than expected and are consistent with the long-appreciated and pronounced reduction of cutaneous immunity with aging.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The human visual ability to recognize objects and scenes is widely thought to rely on representations in category-selective regions of visual cortex. These representations could support object vision by specifically representing objects, or, more simply, by representing complex visual features regardless of the particular spatial arrangement needed to constitute real world objects. That is, by representing visual textures. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we leveraged an image synthesis approach that, unlike previous methods, provides independent control over the complexity and spatial arrangement of visual features. We found that human observers could easily detect a natural object among synthetic images with similar complex features that were spatially scrambled. However, observer models built from BOLD responses from category-selective regions, as well as a model of macaque inferotemporal cortex and Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks, were all unable to identify the real object. This inability was not due to a lack of signal-to-noise, as all of these observer models could predict human performance in image categorization tasks. How then might these texture-like representations in category-selective regions support object perception? An image-specific readout from category-selective cortex yielded a representation that was more selective for natural feature arrangement, showing that the information necessary for object discrimination is available. Thus, our results suggest that the role of human category-selective visual cortex is not to explicitly encode objects but rather to provide a basis set of texture-like features that can be infinitely reconfigured to flexibly learn and identify new object categories.\n\nSignificance StatementVirtually indistinguishable metamers of visual textures, such as wood grain, can be synthesized by matching complex features regardless of their spatial arrangement (1-3). However, humans are not fooled by such synthetic images of scrambled objects. Thus, category-selective regions of human visual cortex might be expected to exhibit representational geometry preferentially sensitive to natural objects. Contrarily, we demonstrate that observer models based on category-selective regions, models of macaque inferotemporal cortex and Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks do not preferentially represent natural images, even while they are able to discriminate image categories. This suggests the need to reconceptualize the role of category-selective cortex as representing a basis set of complex texture-like features, useful for a myriad of visual behaviors.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Diet selection is a fundamental aspect of animal behavior with numerous ecological and evolutionary implications. While the underlying mechanisms are complex, the availability of essential dietary nutrients can strongly influence diet selection behavior. The gut microbiome has been shown to metabolize many of these same nutrients, leading to the untested hypothesis that intestinal microbiota may influence diet selection. Here we show that germ-free mice colonized by gut microbiota from three rodent species with distinct foraging strategies differentially selected diets that varied in macronutrient composition. Specifically, we found that herbivore-conventionalized mice voluntarily selected a higher protein:carbohydrate ratio diet, while omnivore- and carnivore-conventionalized mice selected a lower P:C ratio diet. In support of the long-standing hypothesis that tryptophan - the essential amino acid precursor of serotonin - serves as a peripheral signal regulating diet selection, bacterial genes involved in tryptophan metabolism and plasma tryptophan availability prior to the selection trial were significantly correlated with subsequent voluntary carbohydrate intake. Finally, herbivore-conventionalized mice exhibited larger intestinal compartments associated with microbial fermentation, broadly reflecting the intestinal morphology of their donor species. Together, these results demonstrate that gut microbiome can influence host diet selection behavior, perhaps by mediating the availability of essential amino acids, thereby revealing a novel mechanism by which the gut microbiota can influence host foraging behavior.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe behavior of diet choice or diet selection can have wide-reaching implications, scaling from individual animals to ecological and evolutionary processes. Previous work in this area has largely ignored the potential for intestinal microbiota to modulate these signals. This notion has been highly speculated for years but has not yet been explicitly tested. Here we show that germ-free mice colonized by differential microbiomes (from wild rodents with varying natural feeding strategies) exhibited significant differences in their voluntary dietary selection. Specifically, differences in voluntary carbohydrate selection were associated with plasma amino acid levels and bacterial genes involved in the metabolism of tryptophan. Together, these results demonstrate a role for the microbiome in host nutritional physiology and behavior.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Elucidating regulatory effects of Alzheimers disease (AD)-associated genetic variants is critical for unraveling their causal pathways and understanding the pathology. However, their cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in the brain remain largely unclear. Here, we conducted an analysis of allele-specific expression quantitative trait loci (aseQTLs) for 33 AD-associated variants in four brain regions and seven cell types using ~3000 bulk RNA-seq samples and >0.25 million single nuclei. We develop a flexible framework using a hierarchical Poisson mixed model unifying samples in both allelic and genotype-level expression data. We identified 24 AD-associated variants (~73%) that are allele-specific eQTLs (aseQTLs) in at least one brain region. Multiple aseQTLs are region-dependent or exon-specific, such as rs2093760 with CR1, rs7982 with CLU, and rs3865444 with CD33. Notably, the APOE {varepsilon}4 variant reduces APOE expression across all regions, even in healthy controls. In pinpointing the cell types responsible for the observed region-level aseQTLs, we found rs2093760 as an aseQTL of CR1 in oligodendrocytes but not in microglia. Many AD-associated variants are aseQTLs in microglia or monocytes of immune-related genes, including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, CD33, FCER1G, MS4A6A, SPI1, and BIN1, highlighting the regulatory role of AD-associated variants in the immune response. These findings provide further insights into potential causal pathways and cell types mediating the effects of the AD-associated variants.",

To access representatives of locally and globally distinct wild plants and investigate their viral diversity, we extracted and sequenced dsRNA from leaves from 16 healthy oak and conifer trees in the UC Davis Arboretum (Davis, California). From de novo assemblies, we recovered 389 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences from 384 putative viral species, and a further 580 putative viral contigs were identified with virus prediction software followed by manual confirmation of virus annotation. Based on similarity to known viruses, most recovered viruses were predicted to infect plants or fungi, with the highest diversity and abundance observed in the Totiviridae and Mitoviridae families. Phyllosphere viral community composition differed significantly by host plant phylogeny, suggesting the potential for host-specific viromes. The phyllosphere viral community of one oak tree differed substantially from other oak viral communities and contained a greater proportion of putative mycoviral sequences, potentially due to the trees more advanced senescence at the time of sampling. These results suggest that oaks and conifers harbor a vast diversity of viruses with as-yet unknown roles in plant health and phyllosphere microbial ecology.",

Like podocytes, nephrocytes exhibit characteristics of epithelial cells, but the role of phospholipids in polarization of these cells is yet unclear. In epithelia phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) are asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane and determine apical-basal polarity. Here we demonstrate that both phospholipids are present in the plasma membrane of nephrocytes, but only PI(4,5)P2 accumulates at slit diaphragms. Knockdown of Skittles, a phosphatidylinositol(4)phosphate 5-kinase, which produces PI(4,5)P2, abolished slit diaphragm formation and led to strongly reduced endocytosis. Notably, reduction in PI(3,4,5)P3 by overexpression of PTEN or expression of a dominant-negative phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase did not affect nephrocyte function, whereas enhanced formation of PI(3,4,5)P3 by constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase resulted in strong slit diaphragm and endocytosis defects by ectopic activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 but not PI(3,4,5)P3 is essential for slit diaphragm formation and nephrocyte function. However, PI(3,4,5)P3 has to be tightly controlled to ensure nephrocyte development.",

The specificity of allelic variants to different human populations can, however, be a rich source of information when studying the genetic basis of population-specific immune responses in vaccination and disease. To make TR germline alleles available for such population-specific studies, we meticulously identified true germline alleles enriched with complete TR allele sequences and their frequencies across 26 different human populations, profiled by \"1,000 Genomes data\". We identified 205 TRAV, 249 TRBV, 16 TRGV and 5 TRDV germline alleles supported by at least four haplotypes (= minimum of two individuals). The diversity of germline allelic variants in the TR loci is highest in Africans followed by Non-African populations. A majority of the Non-African alleles are specific to the Asian populations, suggesting a diverse profile of TR germline alleles in different human populations. Interestingly, the alleles known in the IMGT database are frequent and common across all the superpopulations. We believe that this new set of genuine germline TR sequences represents a valuable new resource which we have made available through the new population-matched TR (pmTR) database, accessible via https://pmtrig.lumc.nl/.",

Aside from being conserved from bacteria to vertebrates, their importance is also reflected in the fact that in humans impaired function of multiple RecQ helicase orthologs are known to cause severe sets of problems, including Bloom, Werner or Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Our aim was to create and characterize a zebrafish (Danio rerio) disease model for Bloom syndrome, a recessive autosomal disorder. In humans, this syndrome is characterized by short stature, skin rashes, reduced fertility, increased risk of carcinogenesis and shortened life expectancy brought on by genomic instability. We show that zebrafish blm mutants recapitulate major hallmarks of the human disease, such as shortened lifespan and reduced fertility. Moreover, similarly to other factors involved in DNA repair, some functions of zebrafish Blm bear additional importance in germ line development, and consequently in sex differentiation. Unlike fanc genes and rad51, however, blm appears to effect its function independent of tp53. Therefore, our model will be a valuable tool for further understanding the developmental and molecular attributes of this rare disease, along with providing novel insights into the role of genome maintenance proteins in somatic DNA repair and fertility.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Individual insects flying in crowded assemblies perform complex aerial maneuvers by sensing and feeding back neighbor measurements to small changes in their wing motions. To understand the individual feedback rules that permit these fast, adaptive behaviors in group flight, a high-speed tracking system is needed capable of tracking both body motions and more subtle wing motion changes for multiple insects in simultaneous flight. This capability extends tracking beyond the previous focus on individual insects to multiple insects. This paper presents Hi-VISTA, which provides a capability to track wing and body motions of multiple insects using high speed cameras (9000 fps). Processing steps consist of automatic background identification, data association, hull reconstruction, segmentation, and feature measurement. To improve the biological relevance of laboratory experiments and develop a platform for interaction studies, this paper applies the Hi-VISTA measurement system to Apis mellifera foragers habituated to transit flights through a transparent tunnel. Binary statistical analysis (Welchs t-test, Cohens d effect size) of 95 flight trajectories is presented, quantifying the differences between flights in an unobstructed tunnel and in a confined tunnel volume. The results indicate that body pitch angle, heading rate, flapping frequency, and vertical speed (heave) are all affected by confinement, and other flight variables show minor or statistically insignificant changes. These results form a baseline as swarm tracking and analysis begins to isolate the effects of neighbors from environment.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Properly responding to DNA damage is vital for eukaryotic cells, including the induction of DNA repair, growth arrest and, as a last resort to prevent neoplastic transformation, cell death. Besides being crucial for ensuring homeostasis, the same pathways and mechanisms are at the basis of chemoradiotherapy in cancer treatment, which involves therapeutic induction of DNA damage by chemical or physical (radiological) measures. Apart from typical DNA damage response mediators, the relevance of cell-intrinsic antiviral signaling pathways in response to DNA breaks has recently emerged. Originally known for combatting viruses via expression of antiviral factors including IFNs and establishing of an antiviral state, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) were found to be critical for adequate induction of cell death upon the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks. We here show that presence of IRF3 is crucial in this process, most likely through direct activation of pro-apoptotic factors rather than transcriptional induction of canonical downstream components, such as IFNs. Investigating genes reported to be involved in both DNA damage response and antiviral signaling, we demonstrate that IRF1 is an obligatory factor for DNA damage-induced cell death. Interestingly, its regulation does not require activation of RLR signaling, but rather sensing of DNA double strand breaks by ATM and ATR. Hence, even though independently regulated, both RLR signaling and IRF1 are essential for proper induction/execution of intrinsic apoptosis. Our results not only support more broadly developing IRF1 as a biomarker predictive for the effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy, but also suggest investigating a combined pharmacological stimulation of RLR and IRF1 signaling as a potential adjuvant regimen in tumor therapy.",

Overall we achieve a performance accuracy of 35.20% and 29.21% when classifying 5 vowels and 6 words respectively in a publicly available dataset, using our tuned iSpeech-CNN architecture.

    "preprint_abstract": "Methylation of cytosines on DNA is a prominent modification associated with gene expression regulation. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have recurrently been linked to dysregulation of the regulatory program in cancer cells. To shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism driving this process, we hypothesized that aberrant methylation patterns could be controlled by the binding of specific transcription factors (TFs) across cancer types. By combining DNA methylation arrays and gene expression data with TF binding sites (TFBSs), we explored the interplay between TF binding and DNA methylation in 19 cancer types. We performed emQTL (expression-methylation quantitative trait loci) analyses independently in each cancer type and identified 13 TFs whose expression levels are correlated with local DNA methylation patterns around their binding sites in at least 2 cancer types. The 13 TFs are mainly associated with local demethylation and are enriched for pioneer function, suggesting a specific role for these TFs in modulating chromatin structure and transcription in cancer patients. Furthermore, we confirmed that de novo methylation is precluded across cancers at CpGs lying in genomic regions enriched for TF-binding signatures associated with SP1, CTCF, NRF1, GABPA, KLF9, and/or YY1. The modulation of DNA methylation associated with TF binding was observed at cis-regulatory regions controlling immune- and cancer-associated pathways, corroborating that the emQTL signals were derived from both cancer and tumor-infiltrating cells. As a case example, we experimentally confirmed that FOXA1 knock-down is associated with higher methylation in regions bound by FOXA1 in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Finally, we reported physical interactions between FOXA1 with TET1 and TET2 both in an in vitro setup and in vivo at physiological levels in MCF-7 cells, adding further support for FOXA1 attracting TET1 and TET2 to induce local demethylation in cancer cells.",

The discovery and characterization of small molecules that antagonize Vpu would further elucidate the contribution of Vpu to pathogenesis and lay the foundation for the study of a new class of novel HIV-1 therapeutics. To identify novel compounds that block Vpu activity, we developed a cell-based  gain of function assay that produces a positive signal in response to Vpu inhibition. To develop this assay, we took advantage of the viral glycoprotein, GaLV Env. In the presence of Vpu, GaLV Env is not incorporated into viral particles, resulting in non-infectious virions. Vpu inhibition restores infectious particle production. Using this assay, a high throughput screen of >650,000 compounds was performed to identify inhibitors that block the biological activity of Vpu. From this screen, we identified several positive hits but focused on two compounds from one structural family, SRI-41897 and SRI-42371. It was conceivable that the compounds inhibited the formation of infectious virions by targeting host cell proteins instead of Vpu directly, so we developed independent counter-screens for off target interactions of the compounds and found no off target interactions. Additionally, these compounds block Vpu-mediated modulation of CD4, BST-2/Tetherin and antibody dependent cell-mediated toxicity (ADCC). Unfortunately, both SRI-41897 and SRI-42371 were shown to be specific to the N-terminal region of NL4-3 Vpu and did not function against other, more clinically relevant, strains of Vpu.",

The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) sub-type is associated with an especially poor prognosis because currently available therapies, fail to induce long-lasting responses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies that result in durable responses. One universal characteristic of the tumor microenvironment is a markedly elevated concentration of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP). Chemotherapy exposure results in further increases in eATP through its release into the extracellular space of cancer cells via P2RX channels. eATP levels are reduced by eATPases. Given that high concentrations of eATP are cytotoxic, we hypothesized that augmenting the release of eATP through P2RX channels and inhibiting extracellular ATPases would sensitize TNBC cells to chemotherapy.\n\nMethodsTNBC cell lines MDA-MB 231, Hs 578t and MDA-MB 468 and non-tumorigenic immortalized mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells were treated with increasing concentrations the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel in the presence of eATPase inhibitors, specific agonists or antagonists of P2RXs with cell viability and eATP content being measured. Additionally, the mRNA, protein and cell surface expressions of the purinergic receptors P2RX4 and P2RX7 were evaluated in all examined cell lines via qRT-PCR, western blot, and flow cytometry analyses, respectively.\n\nResultsIn the present study, we observed dose-dependent declines in cell viability and increases in eATP in paclitaxel-treated TNBC cell lines in the presence of inhibitors of eATPases. These effects were reversed by specific antagonists of P2RXs. Similar results were observed with P2RX activators. All examined cell lines expressed both P2RX4 and P2RX7 at the mRNA, protein and cell surface levels.\n\nConclusionThese results reveal that eATP modulates the chemotherapeutic response in TNBC cell lines which could be exploited to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens for TNBC.",

    "preprint_abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the bacterial composition and inferring function profiles in the biofloc system rearing Litopenaeus vannamei postlarvae (PL) at a low salinity condition. PL (~ stage 15) were stocked in four parallel tanks filled in water with a salinity of 5.0{per thousand} at a density of 4000 individuals per m3 for a 28-days culture experiment, during which glucose was added as carbon source with a C:N of 20:1. At the end of experiment, water was sampled from each tank and pooled to extract microbial DNA for high-throughput sequencing of V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. Results showed that the bacterial community at 28 d was dominated by phyla of Proteobacteria (45.8%), Bacteroidetes (21.1%), Planctomycetes (13.5%), Chlamydiae (10.3%) and Firmicutes (6.8%). A proportion of 81% inferring KEGG functions of this bacterial community associated with metabolism. Among functions relating to nitrogen metabolism, 48.5% were involved in the conversion of ammonia to glutamate, but the proportion of those involved in transformation among ammonia, nitrite and nitrate was 18.0% in total, inferring higher protein-synthesis but lower inorganic nitrogen-transformation capacities of the bacterial community. At the same time (28 d), high levels of total nitrogen (231.3{+/-}6.0 mg L-1) and biofloc (127.0{+/-}63.0 mL L-1), but low concentrations of ammonia (0.04{+/-}0.01 mg L-1), nitrite (0.2{+/-}0.1 mg L-1) and nitrate (12.9{+/-}2.5 mg L-1) were observed. The results supply a novel insight for understanding the function of bacterial community in the biofloc system nursing L. vannamei PL at a low salinity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hair cells are the sensory receptors in the auditory and vestibular systems of all vertebrates, and in the lateral-line system of aquatic vertebrates. During development, spontaneous activity in hair cells shapes the formation of these sensory systems. In auditory hair cells of mice, coordinated waves of spontaneous activity can be triggered by concomitant activity in nearby supporting cells. But in mammals, developing auditory and vestibular hair cells can also autonomously generate spontaneous events independent of supporting cell activity. To date, significant progress has been made studying spontaneous activity in the auditory and vestibular systems of mammals, in isolated cultures. The purpose of this work is to explore the zebrafish lateral-line system as a model to study and understand spontaneous activity in vivo. Our work applies genetically encoded calcium indicators along with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize spontaneous calcium activity in the developing lateral-line system. Consistent with our previous work, we show that spontaneous calcium activity is present in developing lateral-line hair cells. We now show that supporting cells that surround hair cells, and cholinergic efferent terminals that directly contact hair cells are also spontaneously active. Using two-color functional imaging we demonstrate that spontaneous activity in hair cells does not correlate with activity in either supporting cells or cholinergic terminals. We find that during lateral-line development, hair cells autonomously generate spontaneous events. Using localized calcium indicators, we show that within hair cells, spontaneous calcium activity occurs in two distinct domains-the mechanosensory bundle and the presynapse. Further, spontaneous activity in the mechanosensory bundle ultimately drives spontaneous calcium influx at the presynapse. Comprehensively, our results indicate that in developing lateral-line hair cells, autonomously generated spontaneous activity originates with spontaneous mechanosensory events. Overall, with robust spontaneous activity three different cell types, the developing lateral line is a rich model to study these activities in an intact sensory organ. Future work studying this model may further our understanding of these activities and their role in sensory system formation, function and regeneration.",

Here, we present a novel technique using drums made of ultrathin bilayer graphene, where the nanomotion of single bacteria can be measured in its aqueous growth environment. A single E. coli cell is found to generate random oscillations with amplitudes of up to 60 nm, exerting forces of up to 6 nN to its environment. Using mutant strains, we are able to pinpoint the bacterial flagella as the main source of nanomotion. By real-time tracing of changes in nanomotion upon administering antibiotics, we demonstrate that graphene drums can perform antibiotic susceptibility testing with single-cell sensitivity. These findings deepen our understanding of processes underlying cellular dynamics, and pave the way towards high throughput and parallelized rapid screening of the effectiveness of antibiotics in bacterial infections with graphene devices.",

To identify ovarian and uterine cancer vulnerabilities, we analyzed genome-scale CRISPR/ Cas9 loss-of-function screens across 739 human cancer cell lines. We found that many ovarian cancer cell lines overexpress the phosphate importer SLC34A2, which renders them sensitive to loss of the phosphate exporter XPR1. We extensively validated the XPR1 vulnerability in cancer cell lines and found that the XPR1 dependency was retained in vivo. Overexpression of SLC34A2 is frequently observed in tumor samples and is regulated by PAX8 -a transcription factor required for ovarian cancer survival. XPR1 overexpression and copy number amplifications are also frequently observed. Mechanistically, SLC34A2 overexpression and impaired phosphate efflux leads to the accumulation of intracellular phosphate and cell death. We further show that proper localization and phosphate efflux by XPR1 requires a novel binding partner, KIDINS220. Loss of either XPR1 or KIDINS220 results in acidic vacuolar structures which precede cell death. These data point to the XPR1:KIDINS220 complex - and phosphate dysregulation more broadly -as a therapeutic vulnerability in ovarian cancer.",

This interplay is one of the key factors in predicting dose-inactivation curves for high energy ion beam inactivation of virions. We also investigate the adaptation of well-established cross-section data derived from radiation interactions with water to the interactions involving the components of a virion, going beyond the density-scaling approximation developed previously. We conclude that solving one of the grand challenges of structural biology -- the determination of RNA tertiary/quaternary structure -- is intimately linked to predicting ion-beam inactivation of viruses and that the two problems can be mutually informative. Indeed, our simulations show that fast ion beams have a key role to play in elucidating RNA tertiary/quaternary structure.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) utilizes transgenic plants expressing a ribosomal protein fused to a tag for affinity purification of ribosomes and the mRNAs that they are translating. These actively translated mRNAs (translatome) can be interrogated by qPCR or RNAseq. Condition- or cell-specific promoters can be utilized to isolate the translatome of specific cell types, at different growth stages and/or in response to environmental variables. While advantageous for revealing differential expression, this approach may not provide sufficient sensitivity when activity of the condition/cell-specific promoter is weak, when ribosome turnover is low in the cells of interest, or when the targeted cells are ephemeral. In these situations, expressing tagged ribosomes under the control of these specific promoters may not yield sufficient polysomes for downstream analysis. Here, we describe a new TRAP system that employs two transgenes: one is constitutively expressed and encodes a ribosomal protein fused to one fragment of a split GFP; the second is controlled by a stimulus-specific promoter and encodes the second GFP fragment fused to an affinity purification tag. In cells where both transgenes are active, the purification tag is attached to ribosomes by bi-molecular folding and assembly of the split GFP fragments. This approach provides increased sensitivity and better temporal resolution because it labels pre-existing ribosomes and does not depend on rapid ribosome turnover. We describe the optimization and key parameters of this system, and then apply it to a plant-pathogen interaction in which spatial and temporal resolution are difficult to achieve with current technologies.\n\nSignificanceTranslating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) has been modified to allow with increased sensitivity the isolation of RNA from sets of cells in which the activity of condition/cell-specific promoters is weak, ribosome turnover is low, or cells whose nature is ephemeral. Based on the use of a split linker constituted of the GFP driven by a pathogen-inducible promoter, this new TRAP system enabled efficient isolation of translated RNA from pathogen-infected leaf cells.",

In this paper we develop a stage-structured mendelian matrix model and jointly analyze the evolutionary and demographic consequences of SA selection in obligately outcrossing (i.e., dioecious/gonochorous) and partially selfing hermaphrodite populations. We focus on identifying parameter conditions under which SA polymorphism is maintained and the population growth rate remains positive. Additionally, we analyze the effects of inbreeding depression manifesting at different life-history stages and give an illustrative example of the potential for SA polymorphism in real populations using empirically estimated demographic rates for the hermaphroditic flowering plant Mimulus guttatus. Our results show that when population intrinsic growth rates approach one, extinction occurs across large swathes of parameter space favoring SA polymorphism or the fixation of male-beneficial alleles, and that inbreeding depression is a significant problem for maintaining SA polymorphism in partially selfing populations. Despite these demographic challenges, our example with M. guttatus appears to show that demographic rates observed in some real populations are capable of sustaining large regions of viable SA polymorphic space.",

Our theoretical framework allows us to analyse the dynamics of populations composed of several morphs and structured into distinct classes (e.g. age, size, habitats, infection status, species...). We also introduce a new approximation to simplify the eco-evolutionary dynamics using reproductive values. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to the important conceptual case of two-habitat migration-selection models. In particular, we show that our approach allows us to predict both the long-term evolutionary endpoints and the short-term transient dynamics of the eco-evolutionary process, including fast evolution regimes.

We also developed a semi-programmable and intuitively easy topology input method for the biochemical reactions. We tested the software with semantic and stochastic SBML test cases. Tests on symbolic solution and parameter estimation were also included. The software we developed is reliable, well performing, convenient to use, and compliant with most of the SBML tests. So far it is the only systems biology software that supports symbolic, deterministic, and stochastic modeling in one package that also features parameter estimation and SBML support.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundTo grasp the complexity of biological processes, the biological knowledge is often translated into schematic diagrams of biological pathways, such as signalling and metabolic pathways. These pathway diagrams describe relevant connections between biological entities and incorporate domain knowledge in a visual format that is easier for humans to interpret. It has already been established that these diagrams can be represented in machine readable formats, as done in KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways. However, while humans are good at interpreting the message of the creator of such a diagram, algorithms struggle when the diversity in drawing approaches increases. WikiPathways supports multiple drawing styles, and therefore needs to harmonize this to offer semantically enriched access via the Resource Description Framework format. Particularly challenging in the normalization of diagrams are the interactions between the biological entities, so that we can glean information about the connectivity of the entities represented. These interactions include information about the type of interaction (metabolic conversion, inhibition, etc.), the direction, and the participants. Availability of the interactions in a semantic and harmonized format enables searching the full network of biological interactions and integration with the linked data cloud.\n\nResultsWe here study how the graphically modelled biological knowledge in diagrams can be semantified and harmonized efficiently, and exemplify how the resulting data can be used to programmatically answer biological questions. We find that we can translate graphically modelled biological knowledge to a sufficient degree into a semantic model of biological knowledge and discuss some of the current limitations. Furthermore, we show how this interaction knowledge base can be used to answer specific biological questions.\n\nConclusionThis paper demonstrates that most of the graphical biological knowledge from WikiPathways is modelled in the semantic layer of WikiPathways with the semantic information intact and connectivity information preserved. The usability of the WikiPathways pathway and connectivity information has shown to be useful and has been integrated into other platforms. Being able to evaluate how biological elements affect each other is useful and allows, for example, the identification of up or downstream targets that will have a similar effect when modified.",

To date, targeted antiviral interventions against COVID-19 are limited. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to fatal disease. However, the reasons for varying outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection are yet to be elucidated. Here we show that an endogenously activated interferon lambda (IFN{lambda}) pathway leads to resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) model from multiple adult donors, we discovered that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, varied. One of four donors was resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. High baseline IFN{lambda} expression levels and associated interferon stimulated genes correlated with resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway in WD-PNECs with high endogenous IFN{lambda} secretion resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 titres. Conversely, prophylactic IFN{lambda} treatment of WD-PNECs susceptible to infection resulted in reduced viral titres. An endogenously activated IFN{lambda} response, possibly due to genetic differences, may be one explanation for the differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Importantly, our work supports the continued exploration of IFN{lambda} as a potential pharmaceutical against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "preprint_abstract": "PurposeGreater muscle fragility is thought to cause the exhaustion of the muscle stem cells during successive degeneration/repair cycles, leading to muscle wasting and weakness in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Chronic voluntary exercise can partially reduce the susceptibility to contraction induced-muscle injury, i.e., muscle fragility, as shown by a reduced immediate maximal force drop following lengthening contractions, in the dystrophic mdx mice. Here, we studied the effect of Prospero-related homeobox factor 1 gene (Prox1) transfer (overexpression) on fragility in chronically exercised mdx mice, because Prox1 promotes slower type fibres in healthy mice and slower fibres are less fragile in mdx muscle.\n\nMethodsmdx mice received or not Prox1 transfer into the tibialis anterior muscle and performed voluntary running into a wheel during 1 month. We also performed Prox1 transfer in sedentary mdx mice. In situ maximal force production of the muscle in response to nerve stimulation was assessed before, during and after 10 lengthening contractions. Molecular and cellular parameters were also evaluated.\n\nResultsInterestingly, Prox1 transfer reduced the force drop following lengthening contractions in exercised mdx mice (p < 0.05 to 0.01), but not in sedentary mdx mice. It also increased the muscle expression of Myh7 (p < 0.001), MHC-2x (p < 0.01) and Trpc1 (p < 0.01), whereas it reduced that one of Myh4 (p < 0.001) and MHC-2b (p < 0.01) in exercised mdx mice. Moreover, Prox1 transfer decreased the maximal force (p < 0.01) before lengthening contraction in exercised mdx mice (p < 0.01), and reduced muscle weight (p < 0.0001) despite increased Mstn expression (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that the beneficial effect of Prox1 transfer on muscle fragility is only observed in chronically exercised mdx mice. Thus, Prox1 transfer combined to chronic exercise have the potential to substantially slow the progression of the dystrophic disease in the long term.",

Although previous evidence suggests that these two helices can stack on each other, it is unknown what local geometric adjustments could enable A-on-B stacking. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of an RNA-5/DNA-3 strand exchange junction at an anisotropic resolution of 1.6 to 2.2 [A]. The structure reveals that the A-to-B helical transition involves a combination of helical axis misalignment, helical axis tilting and compression of the DNA strand within the RNA:DNA helix, where nucleotides exhibit a mixture of A- and B-form geometry. These structural principles explain previous observations of conformational stability in RNA/DNA exchange junctions, enabling a nucleic acid architecture that is repeatedly populated during biological strand exchange events.",

    "preprint_abstract": "How do people limit awareness of unwanted memories? Evidence suggests that when unwelcome memories intrude, a retrieval stopping process engages the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC; Anderson et al., 2004) to inhibit hippocampal activity (Benoit and Anderson, 2012; Benoit et al., 2015; Gagnepain et al., 2017) and disrupt retrieval. It remains unknown how and when the need to engage prefrontal control is detected, and whether control operates proactively to prevent an unwelcome memory from being retrieved, or must respond reactively, to counteract its intrusion. We hypothesized that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) achieves this function by detecting signals indicating that an unwanted trace is emerging in awareness, and transmitting the need for inhibitory control to right DLPFC (Alexander and Brown, 2011; Botvinick et al., 2001). During a memory suppression task, we measured trial-by-trial variations in dACCs theta power and N2 amplitude, two electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of the need for enhanced control (Cavanagh and Frank, 2014). With simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings, we tracked dynamic interactions between the dACC, rDLPFC and hippocampus during suppression. EEG analyses revealed a clear role of dACC in detecting the need for memory control, and in upregulating prefrontal inhibition. Importantly, we identified dACC contributions before episodic retrieval could have occurred (500 ms) and afterwards, indicating distinct proactive and reactive control signalling. Stronger proactive control by the dACC led to reduced hippocampal activity and diminished overall blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in dACC and rDLPFC, suggesting that pre-empting retrieval early reduced overall control demands. However, when dACC activity followed the likely onset of recollection, retrieval was cancelled reactively: effective connectivity analyses revealed robust communication from dACC to rDLPFC and from rDLPFC to hippocampus, tied to successful forgetting. Together, our findings support a model in which dACC detects the emergence of unwanted content, triggering top-down inhibitory control, and in which rDLPFC countermands intruding thoughts that penetrate awareness.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Signal integration of converging neural circuits is poorly understood. One example is in the retina where the integration of rod and cone signaling is responsible for the large dynamic range of vision. The relative contribution of rods versus cones is dictated by a complex function involving background light intensity and stimulus temporal frequency. One understudied mechanism involved in coordinating rod and cone signaling onto the shared retinal circuit is the hyperpolarization activated current (Ih) mediated by HCN1 channels. Ih opposes membrane hyperpolarization driven by activation of the phototransduction cascade and modulates the strength and kinetics of the photoreceptor voltage response. We examined conditional knockout of HCN1 from rods using electroretinography. In the absence of HCN1, rod responses are prolonged in dim light which altered the response to slow modulation of light intensity both at the level of retinal signaling and behavior. Under brighter intensities, cone-driven signaling was suppressed. To our surprise, conditional knockout of HCN1 from cones had no effect on cone-mediated signaling. We propose that Ih is dispensable in cones due to the high level of temporal control of cone phototransduction. Thus, HCN1 is required for cone-driven retinal signaling only indirectly by modulating the voltage response of rods to limit their output.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467151v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa760borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2be292org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1280235org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a8f487_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "The coexistence of different mating strategies, whereby a species can reproduce both by selfing and outcrossing, is an evolutionary enigma that has long intrigued biologists (Darwin, 1877). Theory predicts only two stable mating states : outcrossing with strong inbreeding depression or selfing with weak inbreeding depression. As these two mating strategies are subject to opposing selective forces, mixed breeding systems are thought to be a rare transitory state, yet they have been found to persist even after multiple speciation events. We hypothesise that if each mating strategy plays a distinctive role during the species life history, opposing selective pressures could be balanced, permitting the stable co-existence of selfing and outcrossing sexual morphs. In this scenario, we would expect each sexual morph to be specialised in their respective roles. Here we show, using a combination of behavioural, physiological and gene expression studies, that the selfing (hermaphrodite) and outcrossing (female) sexual morphs of the trioecious nematode Auanema freiburgensis have distinct adaptations optimised for their different roles during the life cycle. A. freiburgensis hermaphrodites are produced under stressful conditions, are specialised for dispersal to new habitat patches and exhibit metabolic and intestinal changes that enable them to meet the energetic cost of dispersal and reproduction. In contrast, A. freiburgensis females are produced in favourable conditions, facilitate rapid population growth and compensate for the lack of reproductive assurance by reallocating resources from intestinal development to robust mate-finding behaviour. The specialisation of each mating system for their role in the life cycle could balance opposing selective forces allowing the stable maintenance of both outcrossing and selfing mating systems in A. freiburgensis.",

However, no study has compared the relative contribution of these markers to cardiometabolic risk in women of varying age and adiposity. Body composition, regional AT distribution, lipid-lipoprotein profile, glucose homeostasis and plasma A and L levels were determined in 67 women (age: 40-62 years; BMI: 17-41 kg/m2). Expression of macrophage infiltration marker CD68 and adipocyte size were measured from subcutaneous abdominal (SCABD) and omental (OME) fat. AT dysfunction markers correlated with most lipid-lipoprotein levels. The A/L ratio was negatively associated with fasting insulinemia and HOMA-IR, while SCABD or OME adipocyte size and SCABD CD68 expression were positively related to these variables. Combination of tertiles of largest adipocyte size and lowest A/L ratio showed the highest HOMA-IR. Multiple regression analyses including these markers and TAG levels revealed that the A/L ratio was the only predictor of fasting insulinemia and HOMA-IR. The contribution of the A/L ratio was superseded by adipose cell size in the model where the latter replaced TAGs. Finally, leptinemia was a better predictor of IR than adipocyte size and the A/L ratio in our participant sample.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Although fine particulate matter (FPM) in air pollutants and tobacco smoke is recognized as a strong carcinogen and global threat to public health, its biological mechanism for inducing lung cancer remains unclear. Here, by investigating FPMs bioactivities in lung carcinoma mice models, we discover that these particles promote lung tumor progression by inducing aberrant thickening of tissue matrix and hampering migration of anti-tumor immunocytes. Upon inhalation into lung tissue, these FPM particles abundantly adsorb peroxidasin (PXDN) - an enzyme mediating type IV collagen (Col IV) crosslinking - onto their surface. The adsorbed PXDN exerts abnormally high activity to crosslink Col IV via increasing the formation of sulfilimine bonds at the NC1 domain, leading to an overly dense matrix in the lung tissue. This disordered structure decreases the mobility of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes into the lung and consequently impairs the local immune surveillance, enabling the flourish of nascent tumor cells. Meanwhile, inhibiting the activity of PXDN effectively abolishes the tumor-promoting effect of FPM, indicating the key impact of aberrant PXDN activity on tumorigenic process. In summary, our finding elucidates a new mechanism for FPM-induced lung tumorigenesis and identifies PXDN as a potential target for treatment or prevention of the FPM-relevant biological risks.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473156v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b72b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1770adforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6ac69corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@154cce_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Application of the multi-omics system biology approaches including biological network analysis in elucidating the complex host-viral response, allow for interrogating the viral pathogenesis. The present study aimed to fingerprint the system-level alterations during acute CCHFV-infection and the cellular immune responses during productive CCHFV-replication in vitro. We used system-wide network-based system biology analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a longitudinal cohort of CCHF patients during the acute phase of infection and after one year of recovery (convalescent phase) and untargeted quantitative proteomics analysis of the most permissive CCHFV-infected Huh7 and SW13 cells. In the RNAseq analysis of the PBMCs, comparing the acute and convalescent-phase, we observed system-level hosts metabolic reprogramming towards central carbon and energy metabolism (CCEM) with distinct upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during CCHFV-infection. Upon application of network-based system biology methods, negative coordination of the biological signaling systems like FOXO/Notch axis and Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 signaling with metabolic pathways during CCHFV-infection were observed. The temporal quantitative proteomics in Huh7 showed a dynamic change in the CCEM over time and was in agreement with the cross-sectional proteomics in SW13 cells. By blocking the two key CCEM pathways, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, viral replication was inhibited in vitro. Activation of key interferon stimulating genes during infection suggested the role of type I and II interferon-mediated antiviral mechanisms both at system-level and during progressive replication.\n\nSignificance StatementA combination of multi-modal systems-wide host-immune response and in vitro temporal analysis identified molecular re-arrangement in CCEM and fingerprinting the interferon-mediated antiviral mechanism during CCHFV-infection. Using the newly gained insights, we then modulated the key pathways of CCEM by drugs and inhibited the productive CCHFV-replication in in vitro infection models. Our study thus provides a comprehensive, system-level picture of the regulation of cellular and metabolic pathways during productive CCHFV-infection for the first time that aids in identifying novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.",

Our approach is different from current methods, in that it sequesters existing fluxes in the process to be controlled, and in this way takes advantage of the processs architecture to design the control law. This signal sequestration mechanism appears in many natural biological systems and can potentially be easier to realise than  molecular sequestration and other comparison motifs that are nowadays common in biomolecular feedback control design. The loop is closed by linking the strength of signal sequestration to the process output. Our feedback regulation mechanism is motivated by two-component signalling systems, where we introduce a second response regulator competing with the natural response regulator thus sequestering kinase activity. Here, dichotomous feedback is established by increasing the concentration of the second response regulator as the level of the output of the natural process increases. Extensive analysis demonstrates how this type of feedback shapes the signal response, attenuates intrinsic noise while increasing robustness and reducing crosstalk.",

By targeting the gene oca2 required for melanin synthesis in other vertebrate species, we show efficient editing and germline transmission. Gene edits include indels in the coding region, likely a result of non-homologous end joining, and a large deletion in the 3' UTR due to homology-directed repair. We find that oca2 knock-out A. calliptera lack melanin, which may be useful for developmental imaging in embryos and studying colour pattern formation in adults.

Understanding the structural dynamicity, with respect to energy landscape, is essential to describe their biological functions. The ability to study the dynamical properties of a single protein molecule is thus crucial, but ensuring that multiple physical properties can be simultaneously extracted within a single experiment on the exact same protein molecule in real-time has hitherto been infeasible.\n\nHere, we present magnetic tweezers technology that surmounts this limitation, providing real-time dynamic information about changes in several molecular properties ({Delta}G0, conformation, and mean first passage time of unfolding and refolding) from a single experiment, by remeasuring the very same protein molecule in varying chemical condition. We illustrate the versatility of the method by studying electrolyte-dependent conformational flexibility and the energy landscape of substrate protein L under force. Changing salt concentrations reshapes the energy landscape by two specific ways: it speeds-up refolding kinetics while slowing down unfolding kinetics. From the same trajectory, we calculate the stiffness of the protein polymer, a quantity that varies with salt concentration. The data is described within the framework of a modified  electrolyte FJC model that we propose and study here. The observed correlation between{Delta} G0, kinetics and polymer elasticity connect protein chain physics and the energy landscape, while the experimental methodology we describe of getting energy landscape from a single experiment could have wide-ranging applications.",

This allows for spatial characterization of molecular compositions of different tissue types and tumor subtypes, which bears great potential for assisting pathologists with diagnostic decisions or personalized treatments. Unfortunately, progress in translational MSI is often hindered by insufficient quality control and lack of reproducible data analysis. Raw data and analysis scripts are rarely publicly shared. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Galaxy MSI tool set for the reproducible analysis of an urothelial carcinoma dataset.\n\nMethodsTryptic peptides were imaged in a cohort of 39 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human urothelial cancer tissue cores with a MALDI-TOF/TOF device. The complete data analysis was performed in a fully transparent and reproducible manner on the European Galaxy Server. Annotations of tumor and stroma were performed by a pathologist and transferred to the MSI data to allow for supervised classifications of tumor vs. stroma tissue areas as well as for muscle-infiltrating and non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas. For putative peptide identifications, m/z features were matched to the MSiMass list.\n\nResultsRigorous quality control in combination with careful pre-processing enabled reduction of m/z shifts and intensity batch effects. High classification accuracy was found for both, tumor vs. stroma and muscle-infiltrating vs. non-muscle invasive tumors. Some of the most discriminative m/z features for each condition could be assigned a putative identity: Stromal tissue was characterized by collagen type I peptides and tumor tissue by histone and heat shock protein beta-1 peptides.\n\nIntermediate filaments such as cytokeratins and vimentin were discriminative between the tumors with different muscle-infiltration status. To make the study fully reproducible and to advocate the criteria of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) research data, we share the raw data, spectra annotations as well as all Galaxy histories and workflows. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026459 and Galaxy results via https://github.com/foellmelanie/Bladder_MSI_Manuscript_Galaxy_links.\n\nConclusionHere, we show that translational MSI data analysis in a fully transparent and reproducible manner is possible and we would like to encourage the community to join our efforts.",

One of the various functions of the gut epithelium, is to keep the microbes at bay to avoid overstimulation of the underlying mucosa immune cells. To do so, the gut epithelia secrete a variety of antimicrobial peptides, such as chromogranin A (CgA) peptide catestatin (CST: hCgA352-372). As a defense mechanism, gut microbes have evolved antimicrobial resistance mechanisms to counteract the killing effect of the secreted peptides. To this end, we treated wild-type mice and CST knockout (CST-KO) mice (where only the 63 nucleotides encoding CST have been deleted) with CST for 15 consecutive days. CST treatment was associated with a shift in the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the CST-KO mice. This effect was less prominent in WT mice. Levels of the microbiota-produced short-chain fatty acids, in particular, butyrate and acetate were significantly increased in CST-treated CST-KO mice but not the WT group. Both CST-treated CST-KO and WT mice showed a significant increase in microbiota-harboring phosphoethanolamine transferase-encoding genes, which facilitate their antimicrobial resistance. Finally, we show that CST was degraded by Escherichia coli via an omptin-protease and that the abundance of this gene was significantly higher in metagenomic datasets collected from patients with Crohns disease but not with ulcerative colitis. Overall, this study illustrates how the endogenous antimicrobial peptide, CST, shapes the microbiota composition in the gut and primes further research to uncover the role of bacterial resistance to CST in disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a powerful and widely used approach to decipher the genetic control of complex traits. A major challenge for dissecting quantitative traits in forest trees is statistical power. In this study, we use a population consisting of 1123 samples from two successive generations that have been phenotyped for growth and wood property traits and genotyped using the EuChip60K chip, yielding 37,832 informative SNPs. We use multi-locus GWAS models to assess both additive and dominance effects to identify markers associated with growth and wood property traits in the eucalypt hybrids. Additive and dominance association models identified 78 and 82 significant SNPs across all traits, respectively, which captured between 39 and 86% of the genomic-based heritability. We also used SNPs identified from the GWAS and SNPs using less stringent significance thresholds to evaluate predictive abilities in a genomic selection framework. Genomic selection models based on the top 1% SNPs captured a substantially greater proportion of the genetic variance of traits compared to when all SNPs were used for model training. The prediction ability of estimated breeding values was significantly improved for all traits using either the top 1% SNPs or SNPs identified using a relaxed p-value threshold (p<10-3). This study highlights the added value of also considering dominance effects for identifying genomic regions controlling growth traits in trees. Moreover, integrating GWAS results into genomic selection method provides enhanced power relative to discrete associations for identifying genomic variation potentially useful in tree breeding.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates nearly all exchanges between nucleus and cytoplasm, and changes composition in many species as the organism ages. However, how these changes arise and whether they contribute themselves to aging is poorly understood. We show that in replicatively aging yeast cells attachment of DNA circles to NPCs drives the displacement of the NPCs nuclear basket and cytoplasmic complexes. Remodeling of the NPC resulted from the regulation of basket components by SAGA, rather than from damages. These changes affected NPC interaction with mRNA export factors, without affecting the residence of import factors or engaging the NPC quality control machinery. Mutations preventing NPC remodeling extended the replicative lifespan of the cells. Thus, our data indicate that DNA circles accumulating in the mother cell drive aging at least in part by triggering NPC specialization. We suggest that antagonistic pleiotropic effects of NPC specialization are key drivers of aging.",

Here, we present the pantothenamide MMV693183 as a first-in-class acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) inhibitor to enter preclinical development. Our studies demonstrated attractive drug-like properties and in vivo efficacy in a humanized mouse model of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The compound showed exceptional in vitro activity against P. falciparum and P. vivax clinical isolates, and potently blocked P. falciparum transmission to Anopheles mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical studies identified ACS as the target of the MMV693183-derived antimetabolite, CoA-MMV693183. MMV693183 was well adsorbed after oral administration in mice, rats and dogs. Pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic modelling predicted that a single 30 mg oral dose is sufficient to cure a malaria infection in humans. In conclusion, the ACS-targeting compound MMV693183 represents a promising addition to the portfolio of antimalarials in (pre)clinical development with a novel mode of action for the treatment of malaria and blocking transmission.",

In glacier-fed streams (GFSs), ecological windows of opportunities allow complex microbial biofilms to develop and transiently form the basis of the food web, thereby controlling key ecosystem processes. Here, using high-resolution metagenomics, we unravel strategies that allow biofilms to seize this opportunity in an ecosystem otherwise characterized by harsh environmental conditions. We found a diverse microbiome spanning the entire tree of life and including a rich virome. Various and co-existing energy acquisition pathways point to diverse niches and the simultaneous exploitation of available resources, likely fostering the establishment of complex biofilms in GFSs during windows of opportunity. The wide occurrence of rhodopsins across metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), besides chlorophyll, highlights the role of solar energy capture in these biofilms. Concomitantly, internal carbon and nutrient cycling between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs may help overcome constraints imposed by the high oligotrophy in GFSs. MAGs also revealed mechanisms potentially protecting bacteria against low temperatures and high UV-radiation. The selective pressure of the GFS environment is further highlighted by the phylogenomic analysis, differentiating the representatives of the genus Polaromonas, an important component of the GFS microbiome, from those found in other ecosystems. Our findings reveal key genomic underpinnings of adaptive traits that contribute to the success of complex biofilms to exploit environmental opportunities in GFSs, now rapidly changing owing to global warming.",

The article has an unusual bibliometric trajectory in that it is much more salient in the bibliographic record today compared to the first 20 years after its publication. Here, we show how the papers fame was shaped by four factors: 1) citations in influential publications across several disciplines; 2) Lewontins own popular books and media appearances; 3) the renaissance of population genetics research of the early 1990s; and 4) the serendipitous collision of scientific progress, influential books/papers, and heated controversies in the year 1994.

Despite their conserved function, centromeres do not contain conserved DNA sequences and are instead epigenetically marked by the presence of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A (centromeric protein A). The functional contribution of centromeric DNA sequences to centromere identity remains elusive. Previous work found that dyad symmetries with a propensity to adopt non-canonical secondary DNA structures are enriched at the centromeres of several species. These findings lead to the proposal that such non-canonical DNA secondary structures may contribute to centromere specification. Here, we analyze the predicted secondary structures of the recently identified centromere DNA sequences from Drosophila melanogaster. Although dyad symmetries are only enriched on the Y centromere, we find that other types of non-canonical DNA structures, including DNA melting and G-quadruplexes, are common features of all D. melanogaster centromeres. Our work is consistent with previous models suggesting that non-canonical DNA secondary structures may be conserved features of centromeres with possible implications for centromere specification.",

In this study we present an end-to-end integrative, scalable concept extending from the molecular to the macroscopic level.\n\nMethodsA hybrid scaffold device was manufactured by 3D-(bio)printing. INS-1 cells with/without endothelial cells were bioprinted in gelatin methacrylate blend hydrogel. Polycaprolactone was 3D-printed and heparin-functionalized as structural scaffold component. In vitro evaluation was performed by viability and growth assays, total mRNA sequencing, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In vivo, xenotransplantation to fertilized chicken eggs was used to investigate vascularization and function, and finite element analysis modeling served to detect boundary conditions and applicability for human islets of Langerhans.\n\nResultsInsulin-secreting pseudoislets were formed and resulted in a viable and proliferative experimental model. Transcriptomics revealed upregulation of proliferative and {beta}-cell-specific signaling cascades, downregulation of apoptotic pathways, and overexpression of extracellular matrix proteins and VEGF induced by pseudoislet formation and 3D culture. Co-culture with human endothelial cells created a natural cellular niche resulting in enhanced insulin response after glucose stimulation. Survival and function of the pseudoislets after explantation and extensive scaffold vascularization of both the hydrogel and heparinized polycaprolactone components were demonstrated in ovo. Computer simulations of oxygen, glucose, and insulin flows were used to evaluate scaffold architectures and Langerhans islets at a future transplantation site along neurovascular structures.\n\nConclusionA defined end-to-end process for multidisciplinary bioconvergence research on a bioartificial endocrine pancreas was developed. A modular, patient-specific device architecture is proposed for future research studies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The dental system of ceratopsids is among the most specialized structure in Dinosauria, and includes high angled wear surfaces, split tooth roots, and multiple teeth in each tooth family. However, the early evolution of this unique dental system is generally poorly understood due to a lack of knowledge of the dental morphology and development in early-diverging ceratopsians. Here we study the dental system of three of the earliest-diverging Chinese ceratopsians: Yinlong and Hualianceratops from the early Late Jurassic of Xinjiang, and Chaoyangsaurus from the Late Jurassic of Liaoning. By using micro-computed tomographic analyses, our study has revealed significant new information regarding the dental system of these early ceratopsians, including no more than five replacement teeth in each jaw quadrant; at most one generation of replacement teeth in each alveolus; nearly full resorption of the functional tooth root during tooth replacement; and occlusion with low-angled, concave wear facets that differs significantly from the shearing occlusal system seen in ceratopsids. Yinlong displays an increase in the number of maxillary tooth alveoli and a decrease in the number of replacement teeth during ontogeny as well as the retention of remnants of functional teeth in the largest individual. Early-diverging ceratopsians thus display a relatively slow tooth replacement rate compared to late-diverging ceratopsians. Combined with paleobotany and palaeoenvironment data, Yinlong likely uses gastroliths to triturate foodstuffs, and the difference in diet strategy might have influenced the pattern of tooth replacement in later-diverging ceratopsians.",

Here we show, for the first time, that INaR can be reconstituted in a heterologous system by co-expression of sodium channel -subunits and A-type fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs). Specifically, A-type FHFs induces INaR from Nav1.8, Nav1.9 tetrodotoxin-resistant neuronal channels and, to a lesser extent, neuronal Nav1.7 and cardiac Nav1.5 channels. Moreover, we identified the N-terminus of FHF as the critical molecule responsible for A-type FHFs-mediated INaR. Among the FHFs, FHF4A is the most important isoform for mediating Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 INaR. In nociceptive sensory neurons, FHF4A knockdown significantly reduces INaR amplitude and the percentage of neurons that generate INaR, substantially suppressing excitability. Thus, our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying TTX-resistant INaR generation and provides important potential targets for pain treatment.",

The latter is not necessarily the case. Instead, axons may originate from dendrites. The terms \"axon carrying dendrite\" (AcD) and \"AcD neurons\" have been coined to describe this feature. Here, we report on the diversity of axon origins in neocortical pyramidal cells. We found that in non-primates (rodent, cat, ferret, pig), 10-21% of pyramidal cells of layers II-VI had an AcD. In marked contrast, in macaque and human, this proportion was lower, and it was particularly low for supragranular neurons. Unexpectedly, pyramidal cells in the white matter of postnatal cat and aged human cortex exhibit AcDs to much higher percentages. In rodent hippocampus, AcD cells are functionally  privileged, since inputs here can circumvent somatic integration and lead to immediate action potential initiation in the axon. Our findings expand the current knowledge regarding the distribution and proportion of AcD cells in neocortial regions of non-primate taxa, which strikingly differs from primates where these cells are mainly found in deeper layers and white matter.",

Here using the same in vitro single-vesicle fusion assay, we establish the molecular details of the Complexin clamp and its physiological relevance. We find that a delay in fusion kinetics, likely imparted by Synaptotagmin-1, is needed for Complexin to block fusion. Systematic truncation/mutational analyses reveal that continuous alpha-helical accessory-central domains of Complexin are essential for its inhibitory function and specific interaction of the accessory helix with the SNAREpins, analogous to the trans clamping model, enhances this functionality. The c-terminal domain promotes clamping by locally elevating Complexin concentration through interactions with the membrane. Further, we find that Complexin likely contributes to rapid Ca2+-synchronized vesicular release by preventing un-initiated fusion rather than by directly facilitating vesicle fusion.",

In this study, we utilize a machine learning approach, trained on epigenomic data from the adult human retina, to systematically quantify the predicted impact of cis-regulatory variants.\n\nMethodsWe used human retinal DNA accessibility data (ATAC-seq) to determine a set of 18.9k high-confidence putative cis-regulatory elements. 80% of these elements were used to train a machine learning model utilizing a gapped k-mer support vector machine-based approach. In silico saturation mutagenesis and variant scoring was applied to predict the functional impact of all potential single nucleotide variants within cis-regulatory elements. Impact scores were tested in a 20% hold-out dataset and compared to allele population frequency, phylogenetic conservation, transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, and existing massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data.\n\nResultsWe generated a model that distinguishes between human retinal regulatory elements and negative test sequences with 95% accuracy. Among a hold-out test set of 3.7k human retinal CREs, all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were scored. Variants with negative impact scores correlated with reduced population allele frequency, higher phylogenetic conservation of the reference allele, disruption of predicted TF binding motifs, and massively-parallel reporter expression.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated the utility of human retinal epigenomic data to train a machine learning model for the purpose of predicting the impact of non-coding regulatory sequence variants. Our model accurately scored sequences and predicted putative transcription factor binding motifs. This approach has the potential to expedite the characterization of pathogenic non-coding sequence variants in the context of unexplained retinal disease.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster olfactory neurons have long been thought to express only one chemosensory receptor gene family. There are two main olfactory receptor gene families in Drosophila, the Odorant Receptors (ORs) and the Ionotropic Receptors (IRs). The dozens of odorant binding receptors in each family require at least one co-receptor gene in order to function: Orco for ORs, and Ir25a, Ir8a, and Ir76b for IRs. Using a new genetic knock-in strategy, we targeted the four co-receptors representing the main chemosensory families in Drosophila (Orco, Ir8a, Ir76b, Ir25a). Co-receptor knock-in expression patterns were verified as accurate representations of endogenous expression. We find extensive overlap in expression among the different co-receptors. As defined by innervation into antennal lobe glomeruli, Ir25a is broadly expressed in 88% of all olfactory sensory neuron classes and is co-expressed in 82% of Orco+ neuron classes, including all neuron classes in the maxillary palp. Orco, Ir8a, and Ir76b expression patterns are also more expansive than previously assumed. Single sensillum recordings from Orco-expressing Ir25a mutant antennal and palpal neurons identify changes in olfactory responses. These results suggest co-expression of chemosensory receptors is common in olfactory neurons. Together, our data present the first comprehensive map of chemosensory co-receptor expression and reveal their unexpected widespread co-expression in the fly olfactory system.",

We studied extent of bacterial killing and resistance emergence of meropenem and amikacin as monotherapy and as a combination therapy against susceptible and resistant P. aeruginosa isolates from bacteremic patients using the dynamic in vitro hollow-fiber infection model. Three P. aeruginosa isolates (meropenem MICs 0.125, 0.25 & 64 mg/L) were used simulating bacteremia with an initial inoculum ~1x105 CFU/mL and the expected pharmacokinetics of meropenem and amikacin in critically ill patients. For isolates susceptible to amikacin and meropenem (isolates 1 and 2), the rate of bacterial killing was increased with the combination regimen when compared with monotherapy of either antibiotic. Both the combination and meropenem monotherapy were able to sustain bacterial killing throughout the seven-day treatment course, whereas regrowth of bacteria occurred with amikacin monotherapy after 12 hours. For the meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate (isolate 3), only the combination regimen demonstrated bacterial killing. Given that tailored antibiotic regimens can maximize potential synergy against some isolates, future studies should explore the benefit of combination therapy against resistant P. aeruginosa.",

While tumor-intrinsic mechanisms are likely involved in therapy resistance, it is unclear to what extent host genetic background influences response. To investigate this, we utilized the Diversity Outbred (DO) and Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse models. DO mice are an outbred stock generated by crossbreeding 8 inbred founder strains, and CC mice are recombinant inbred mice generated from the same 8 founders. We generated 207 DOB6F1 mice representing 48 DO dams and demonstrated that these mice reliably accept the C57BL/6-syngeneic B16F0 tumor and that host genetic background influences response to ICI. Genetic linkage analysis from 142 mice identified multiple regions including one within chromosome 13 that associated with therapeutic response. We utilized 6 CC strains bearing the positive (NZO) or negative (C57BL/6) driver genotype in this locus. We found that 2/3 of predicted responder CCB6F1 crosses show reproducible ICI response. The chromosome 13 locus contains the murine prolactin family, which is a known immunomodulating cytokine associated with various autoimmune disorders. To directly test whether prolactin influences ICI response rates, we implanted inbred C57BL/6 mice with subcutaneous slow-release prolactin pellets to induce mild hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin augmented ICI response against B16F0, with increased CD8 infiltration and 5/8 mice exhibiting slowed tumor growth relative to controls. This study highlights the role of host genetics in ICI response and supports the use of F1 crosses in the DO and CC mouse populations as powerful cancer immunotherapy models.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUsing germline genetic analysis in Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross models, we identify prolactin as a host-intrinsic regulator of response to combined immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

The most common control strategy against this species is the use of insecticides that provide minimal, short-term protection. In this context, genomic-based technologies such as RNA interference (RNAi) could be a suitable approach to control this pest in a highly specific manner, avoiding the adverse effects associated with insecticide misuse. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to assess the application of RNAi on D. maidis through different dsRNA delivery methods and known the function of target gene, Bicaudal C (BicC).\n\nRESULTSWe have identified and characterized the core components of the RNAi machinery in silico and established two methods of exogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) delivery to D. maidis. BicC -an important regulator of insect oogenesis-dsRNA was successfully delivered via injection or ingestion to adult females, causing significant reductions in the transcript levels and ovipositions and observable phenotypes in the ovaries when compared to control females. The small doses of dsRNABicC administered were enough to trigger a strong RNAi response, demonstrating that D. maidis is highly sensitive to RNAi.\n\nCONCLUSIONThis is, to our knowledge, the first report describing RNAi application in D. maidis, a tool that can be used to advance towards a novel, insecticide-free control strategy against this pest.",

In adverse environments, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae can enter a stress-resistant diapause state with arrested metabolism and reproductive physiology. Amphid sensory neurons feed into both rapid chemotactic and short-term foraging mode decisions, mediated by amphid and premotor interneurons, as well as the long-term diapause decision. We identify amphid interneurons that integrate pheromone cues and propagate this information via a neuropeptidergic pathways to influence larval developmental fate, bypassing the pre-motor system. AIA interneuron-derived FLP-2 neuropeptide signaling promotes reproductive growth and AIA activity is suppressed by pheromone. FLP-2 acts antagonistically to the insulin-like INS-1. FLP-2s growth promoting effects are inhibited by upstream metabotropic glutamatergic signaling and mediated by the broadly-expressed neuropeptide receptor NPR-30. Conversely, the AIB interneurons and their neuropeptide receptor NPR-9/GALR2 promote diapause entry. These neuropeptidergic outputs allow reuse of parts of a sensory system for a decision with a distinct timescale.",

We find that mitochondrial dysfunction promotes DNA damage under conditions of increased apoptotic priming. Underlying this process, we reveal a key role for mitochondrial dynamics in the regulation of DNA damage and genome instability. The ability of mitochondrial dynamics to regulate oncogenic DNA damage centres upon the control of minority MOMP, a process that enables non-lethal caspase activation leading to DNA damage. Mitochondrial fusion suppresses minority MOMP, and its associated DNA damage, by enabling homogenous mitochondrial expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Finally, we find that mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits pro-apoptotic BAX retrotranslocation, causing BAX mitochondrial localization thereby promoting minority MOMP. Unexpectedly, these data reveal oncogenic effects of mitochondrial dysfunction that are mediated via mitochondrial dynamics and caspase-dependent DNA damage.",

AR misregulation is a hallmark of multiple malignancies, including prostate cancer, where AR hyperactivation and expansion of its transcriptome occur in part through AR gene amplification and interaction with oncoprotein cofactors. Despite its biological importance, how ARs individual domains and its protein cofactors cooperate to bind DNA have remained elusive. Using a combination of reconstitution biochemistry and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (EM), we have isolated three conformational states of AR bound to DNA. We observe that AR forms a non-obligate dimer, with the buried dimer interface utilized by related ancestral nuclear receptors repurposed to facilitate cooperative DNA binding. We identify surfaces bridging ARs domains responsible for allosteric communication, that are compromised in partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and are reinforced by ARs oncoprotein cofactor, ERG, and DNA binding site motifs. Finally, we present evidence that this plastic dimer interface for transcriptional activation may have been adopted by AR at the expense of DNA binding. Our work highlights how fine-tuning of ARs cooperative interactions translate to consequences in development and disease.",

Most recent models accredit this context invariance to an extraction of increasingly complex sensory features in hierarchical feedforward networks.

We show that feedforward neural networks modulated by feedback can dynamically generate invariant sensory representations. The required feedback can be implemented as a slow and spatially diffuse gain modulation. The invariance is not present on the level of individual neurons, but emerges only on the population level. Mechanistically, the feedback modulation dynamically reorients the manifold of neural activity and thereby maintains an invariant neural subspace in spite of contextual variations.

Within the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), a diverse group of putatively episymbiotic bacteria, the genetic potential to produce rhodopsins appears to be confined to a small clade of organisms from sunlit environments. Here, we characterize the metabolic context and biophysical features of Saccharibacteria Type-1 rhodopsin sequences derived from metagenomic surveys and show that these proteins function as outward proton pumps. This provides one of the only known mechanisms by which CPR can generate a proton gradient for ATP synthesis. Intriguingly, Saccharibacteria do not encode the genetic machinery to produce all-trans-retinal, the chromophore essential for rhodopsin function, but their rhodopsins are able to rapidly uptake this cofactor when provided in experimental assays. We found consistent evidence for the capacity to produce retinal from {beta}-carotene in organisms co-occurring with Saccharibacteria, and this genetic potential was dominated by Actinobacteria, which are known hosts of Saccharibacteria in other habitats.

The final descending, or efferent stage, is comprised of lateral olivocochlear (LOC) and medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. MOC somata in the ventral brainstem project axons to the cochlea to synapse onto outer hair cells (OHC), inhibiting OHC-mediated cochlear amplification. MOC suppression of OHC function is implicated in cochlear gain control with changing sound intensity, detection of salient stimuli, attention, and protection against acoustic trauma. Thus, sound excites MOC neurons to provide negative feedback of the cochlea. Sound also inhibits MOC neurons via medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons. However, MNTB-MOC synapses exhibit short-term depression, suggesting reduced MNTB-MOC inhibition during sustained stimuli. Further, due to high rates of both baseline and sound-evoked activity in MNTB neurons in vivo, MNTB-MOC synapses may be tonically depressed. To probe this, we characterized short-term plasticity of MNTB-MOC synapses in mouse brain slices. We mimicked in vivo-like temperature and extracellular calcium conditions, and in vivo-like activity patterns of fast synaptic activation rates, sustained activation, and prior tonic activity. Synaptic depression was sensitive to extracellular calcium concentration and temperature. During rapid MNTB axon stimulation, post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in MOC neurons summated but with concurrent depression, resulting in smaller, sustained currents, suggesting tonic inhibition of MOC neurons during rapid circuit activity. Low levels of baseline MNTB activity did not significantly reduce responses to subsequent rapid activity that mimics sound stimulation, indicating that, in vivo, MNTB inhibition of MOC neurons persists despite tonic synaptic depression.\n\nKey points summaryO_LIInhibitory synapses from MNTB onto MOC neurons exhibit short-term plasticity that is sensitive to calcium and temperature, with enhanced synaptic depression occurring at higher calcium concentrations and at room temperature\nC_LIO_LIHigh rates of background synaptic activity that mimic the upper limits of spontaneous MNTB activity cause tonic synaptic depression of MNTB-MOC synapses that limits further synaptic inhibition\nC_LIO_LIHigh rates of activity at MNTB-MOC synapses cause synaptic summation concurrent depression to yield a response with an initial large amplitude that decays to a tonic inhibition\nC_LI",

Here we asked whether short-term ocular dominance plasticity affects the visual thalamus. We addressed this question in normally sighted adult humans, using ultra-high field (7T) magnetic resonance imaging combined with the paradigm of short-term monocular deprivation. With this approach, we previously demonstrated transient shifts of perceptual eye dominance and ocular dominance in visual cortex (Binda et al., 2018). Here we report evidence for short-term plasticity in the ventral division of the pulvinar (vPulv), where the deprived eye representation was enhanced over the non-deprived eye. This pulvinar plasticity effect was similar as previously seen in visual cortex and it was correlated with the ocular dominance shift measured behaviorally. In contrast, there was no short-term plasticity effect in Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN), where results were reliably different from vPulv, despite their spatial proximity. We conclude that the visual thalamus retains potential for short-term plasticity in adulthood; the plasticity effect differs across thalamic subregions, possibly reflecting differences in their cortical connectivity.",

Aiming to develop scenarios that consider the balance between global and local factors, a new set of land use change scenarios for Brazil were developed, aligned with the global structure Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) developed by the global change research community. The narratives of the new scenarios align with SSP1/RCP 1.9, SSP2/RCP 4.5, and SSP3/RCP 7.0.

Based on detailed biophysical, socio-economic and institutional factors for each biome in Brazil, we have created spatially-explicit scenarios until 2050, considering the following classes: forest vegetation, grassland vegetation, planted pasture, agriculture, mosaic of small land uses, and forestry. The results aim at regionally detailing global models and could be used both regionally to support decision-making, but also to enrich global analysis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cannabis legalization in North America has coincided with an increase in reports of cannabis-induced toxicosis in pets, but the magnitude of this problem, as well as outcomes of these incidents remain unknown. Therefore, we examined the frequency, diagnostic criteria, clinical signs, and prognoses of cannabis toxicoses in pets in North America. We conducted an online survey between January, 2021 and April, 2021 targeting veterinarians practicing in Canada and the United States (US). Out of the 251 study participants, 191 practiced in Canada. Cannabis toxicosis was most commonly reported in dogs (n=226 veterinarians), and the number of toxicosis cases increased significantly in Canada (p<0.0001) and the US (p=0.002) after October, 2018. Frequently reported clinical signs of cannabis toxicosis included: urinary incontinence (n=195), disorientation (n=182), ataxia (n=178), lethargy (n=150), hyperesthesia (n=134), and bradycardia (n=112). Edibles were most commonly suspected to be the cause of toxicosis (n=116). The most common route of exposure was ingestion (n=135), while the most cited reason was ingestion while unattended (n=135). Cannabis toxicosis was mostly diagnosed using supportive clinical signs (n=229), the most common treatment was outpatient monitoring (n=182), and pets were most often treated as out-patients (n=103). The legalization of cannabis use in Canada and the US is likely an important factor associated with the increased cannabis toxicosis cases in pets; however, the legal status may also increase reporting. The medicinal use of cannabis by pet-owners for pets may also contribute to a portion of the reported toxicoses. Most pets that experienced cannabis toxicosis recovered completely, suggesting that most cannabis toxicoses do not result in long-term ill effects. Even though some deaths (n=16) were reported in association with cannabis toxicosis, the presence of confounders such as toxins, and underlying conditions cannot be ruled out, emphasizing the need for rigorous controlled laboratory studies to investigate this important issue.",

Yet, these methods have so far not been applied extensively to invertebrate experimental models such as C. elegans given the long labeling times required for the original promiscuous biotin ligase variant BirA*. Here, we show that the recently developed variant TurboID successfully probes the interactomes of both stably associated (SPD-5) and dynamically localized (PLK-1) centrosomal components. We further develop an indirect proximity labeling method employing a GFP nanobody-TurboID fusion, which allows the identification of protein interactors in a tissue-specific manner in the context of the whole animal. Critically, this approach utilizes available endogenous GFP fusions, avoiding the need to generate multiple additional strains for each target protein and the potential complications associated with overexpressing the protein from transgenes. Using this method, we identify homologs of two highly conserved centriolar components, Cep97 and Bld10/Cep135, which are present in various somatic tissues of the worm. Surprisingly, neither protein is expressed in early embryos, likely explaining why these proteins have escaped attention until now. Our work expands the experimental repertoire for C. elegans and opens the door for further studies of tissue-specific variation in centrosome architecture.",

However, its reported effects on primary motor cortex (M1) are limited. We aimed to better understand tUS effects in human M1 by performing tUS of the hand area of M1 (M1hand) during tonic muscle contraction of the index finger. Stimulation during muscle contraction was chosen because of the transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced phenomenon known as cortical silent period (cSP), in which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1hand involuntarily suppresses voluntary motor activity. Since cSP is widely considered an inhibitory phenomenon, it presents an ideal parallel for tUS, which has often been proposed to preferentially influence inhibitory interneurons. Recording electromyography (EMG) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, we investigated effects on muscle activity both during and after tUS. We found no change in FDI EMG activity concurrent with tUS stimulation. Using single-pulse TMS, we found no difference in M1 excitability before versus after sparsely repetitive tUS exposure. Using acoustic simulations in models made from structural MRI of the participants that matched the experimental setups, we estimated in-brain pressures and generated an estimate of cumulative tUS exposure experienced by M1hand for each subject. We were unable to find any correlation between cumulative M1hand exposure and M1 excitability change. We also present data that suggest a TMS-induced MEP always preceded a near-threshold cSP.",

In this work, we characterized the three Blue Light sensing Using FAD (BLUF) domain-containing proteins encoded in the A. nosocomialis genome, which account for the only \"traditional\" light sensors present in this microorganism. By focusing on a light-modulated bacterial process such as motility, the temperature dependence of light regulation was studied, as well as the expression pattern and spectroscopic characteristics of the different A. nosocomialis BLUFs. Our results show that the three BLUF-containing proteins encode active photoreceptors, despite only two of them are stable in the light-regulatory temperature range when expressed recombinantly. In vivo, only the A. baumanniis ortholog AnBLUF65 is expressed, which is active in a temperature range from 15 {degrees}C to 37 {degrees}C. In turn, AnBLUF46 is an active photoreceptor between 15 {degrees}C to 32 {degrees}C in vitro, but is not expressed in A. nosocomialis in the conditions tested. Intra-protein interactions were analyzed using 3D models built based on A. baumannis photoreceptor, to support spectroscopic data and profile intra-protein residue interactions. A general scheme is presented on how hydrophobic/aromatic interactions may contribute to the stability of dark/light- adapted states, indicating the importance of these interactions in BLUF photoreceptors.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Recent advances in experimental and computational protein structure determination have provided access to high-quality structures for most human proteins and mutants thereof. However, linking changes in structure in protein mutants to functional impact remains an active area of method development. If successful, such methods can ultimately assist physicians in taking appropriate treatment decisions. This work presents three artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive models that classify four key functional parameters of KCNQ1 variants as normal or dysfunctional using PSSM-based evolutionary and/or biophysical descriptors. Recent advances in predicting protein structure and variant properties with artificial intelligence (AI) rely heavily on the availability of evolutionary features and thus fail to directly assess the biophysical underpinnings of a change in structure and/or function. The central goal of this work was to develop an ANN model based on structure and physiochemical properties of KCNQ1 potassium channels that performs comparably or better than algorithms using only on PSSM-based evolutionary features. These biophysical features highlight the structure-function relationships that govern protein stability, function, and regulation. The input sensitivity algorithm incorporates the roles of hydrophobicity, polarizability, and functional densities on key functional parameters of the KCNQ1 channel. Inclusion of the biophysical features outperforms exclusive use of PSSM-based evolutionary features in predicting activation voltage dependence and deactivation time. As AI is increasing applied to problems in biology, biophysical understanding will be critical with respect to  explainable AI, i.e., understanding the relation of sequence, structure, and function of proteins. Our model is available at www.kcnq1predict.org.\n\nAuthor summaryHeartbeat is maintained by electrical impulses generated by ion-conducting channel proteins in the heart such as the KCNQ1 potassium channel. Pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 can lead to channel loss-of-function and predisposition to fatal life-threatening irregularities of heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Machine learning methods that can predict the outcome of a mutation on KCNQ1 structure and function would be of great value in helping to assess the risk of a heart rhythm disorder. Recently, machine learning has made great progress in predicting the structures of proteins from their sequences. However, there are limited studies that link the effect of a mutation and change in protein structure with its function. This work presents the development of neural network models designed to predict mutation-induced changes in KCNQ1 functional parameters such as peak current density and voltage dependence of activation. We compare the predictive ability of features extracted from sequence, structure, and physicochemical properties of KCNQ1. Moreover, input sensitivity analysis connects biophysical features with specific functional parameters that provides insight into underlying molecular mechanisms for KCNQ1 channels. The best performing neural network model is publicly available as a webserver, called Q1VarPredBio, that delivers predictions about the functional phenotype of KCNQ1 variants.",

Approaches comparing cells genome to a control bulk sample miss common mutations, while approaches to find such mutations from bulk suffer from low sensitivity. We developed a tool, All2, which enables accurate filtering of mutations in a cell from exhaustive comparison of cells genomes to each other without data for bulk(s). Based on all pair-wise comparisons, every variant call (point mutation, indel, and structural variant) is classified as either a germline variant, mosaic mutation, or false positive. As All2 allows for considering dropped-out regions, it is applicable to whole genome and exome analysis of cloned and amplified cells. By applying the approach to a variety of available data, we showed that its application reduces false positives, enables sensitive discovery of high frequency mutations, and is indispensable for conducting high resolution cell lineage tracing.

These data sets are invaluable sources of information regarding the function of genes, and they offer unique opportunities to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks in specific cell types. Modular response analysis (MRA) is a well-accepted mathematical modeling method that is precisely aimed at such network inference tasks, but its use has been limited to rather small biological systems so far. In this study, we show that MRA can be employed on large systems with almost 1,000 network components. In particular, we show that MRA performance surpasses general-purpose mutual information-based algorithms. Part of these competitive results was obtained by the application of a novel heuristic that pruned MRA-inferred interactions a posteriori. We also exploited a block structure in MRA linear algebra to parallelize large system resolutions.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe knowledge of gene and protein regulatory networks in specific cell types, including pathologic cells, is an important endeavor in the post-genomic era. A particular type of data obtained through the systematic perturbation of the actors of such networks enables the reconstruction of the latter and is becoming available at a large scale (networks comprised of almost 1,000 genes). In this work, we benchmark the performance of a classical methodology for such data called modular response analysis, which has been so far applied to networks of modest sizes. We also propose improvements to increase performance and to accelerate computations on large problems.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Biochemical interactions in systems and synthetic biology are often modeled with chemical reaction networks (CRNs). CRNs provide a principled modeling environment capable of expressing a huge range of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a software toolbox, written in Python, that compiles high-level design specifications represented using a modular library of biochemical parts, mechanisms, and contexts to CRN implementations. This compilation process offers four advantages. First, the building of the actual CRN representation is automatic and outputs Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models compatible with numerous simulators. Second, a library of modular biochemical components allows for different architectures and implementations of biochemical circuits to be represented succinctly with design choices propagated throughout the underlying CRN automatically. This prevents the often occurring mismatch between high-level designs and model dynamics. Third, high-level design specification can be embedded into diverse biomolecular environments, such as cell-free extracts and in vivo milieus. Finally, our software toolbox has a parameter database, which allows users to rapidly prototype large models using very few parameters which can be customized later. By using BioCRNpyler, users ranging from expert modelers to novice script-writers can easily build, manage, and explore sophisticated biochemical models using diverse biochemical implementations, environments, and modeling assumptions.\n\nAuthor summaryThis paper describes a new software package BioCRNpyler (pronounced \"Biocompiler\") designed to support rapid development and exploration of mathematical models of biochemical networks and circuits by computational biologists, systems biologists, and synthetic biologists. BioCRNpyler allows its users to generate large complex models using very few lines of code in a way that is modular. To do this, BioCRNpyler uses a powerful new representation of biochemical circuits which defines their parts, underlying biochemical mechanisms, and chemical context independently. BioCRNpyler was developed as a Python scripting language designed to be accessible to beginning users as well as easily extendable and customizable for advanced users. Ultimately, we see Biocrnpyler being used to accelerate computer automated design of biochemical circuits and model driven hypothesis generation in biology.",

The estimates of arousal from our model agreed with key predictions: arousal scaled with task difficulty and behavioral performance but was invariant to trial duration. Moreover, the model offers a unified explanation for a wide range of phenomena: entrainment of pupil size and saccade occurrence to task timing, modulation of pupil response amplitude and noise with task difficulty, reaction-time dependent modulation of pupil response timing and amplitude, a constrictory pupil response time-locked to saccades, and task-dependent distortion of this saccade-locked pupil response.",

To unravel the DNA recognition and Pol I selection mechanisms of UAF, we determined the structure of UAF bound to native promoter DNA and transcription factor TBP. We found that UAF recognizes DNA using a hexameric histone-like scaffold with markedly different interactions than the nucleosome and the histone-fold-rich TFIID. UAF strategically sequesters TBP from DNA and Pol II/III-specific factors, and positions it for Core Factor binding, supporting Pol I recruitment. Our findings therefore reveal the molecular basis of Pol I selection for ribosome biogenesis.

The adrenal primordium arises from adrenogenic coelomic epithelium via an epithelial-to- mesenchymal-like transition, which then progresses into the steroidogenic fetal zone via both direct and indirect routes.

One of the most common forms of inducible Cre, CreERT2, requires activation by the synthetic estrogen tamoxifen (TAM) to initiate recombination of LoxP-flanked sequences. To date, most studies deliver TAM via intraperitoneal injection. But the introduction of TAM-infused commercial chows has recently expanded the possible modes of TAM delivery. Despite the widespread use of TAM-inducible genetic models in adult neurogenesis research, the comparative efficiency and off-target effects of TAM administration protocols is surprisingly infrequently studied. Here we compare a standard, 5 day TAM injection regimen with voluntary consumption of TAM-infused chow. First, we used adult NestinCreERT2;Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-EYFP reporter mice to show that 2 weeks of TAM chow and 5 days of injections led to LoxP recombination in a similar phenotypic population of neural stem and progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus. However, TAM chow resulted in substantially less overall recombination than injections. TAM administration also altered adult neurogenesis, but in different ways depending on administration route: TAM injection disrupted neural progenitor cell proliferation 3 weeks after TAM, whereas TAM chow increased neuronal differentiation of cells generated during the diet period.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundEstimation of the accuracy (quality) of protein structural models is important for both prediction and use of protein structural models. Deep learning methods have been used to integrate protein structure features to predict the quality of protein models. Inter-residue distances are key information for predicting proteins tertiary structures and therefore have good potentials to predict the quality of protein structural models. However, few methods have been developed to fully take advantage of predicted inter-residue distance maps to estimate the accuracy of a single protein structural model.\n\nResultWe developed an attentive 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) with channel-wise attention to take only a raw difference map between the inter-residue distance map calculated from a single protein model and the distance map predicted from the protein sequence as input to predict the quality of the model. The network comprises multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, dense layers, and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks with attention to automatically extract features relevant to protein model quality from the raw input without using any expert-curated features. We evaluated DISTEMAs capability of selecting the best models for CASP13 targets in terms of ranking loss of GDT-TS score. The ranking loss of DISTEMA is 0.079, lower than several state-of-the-art single-model quality assessment methods. The work demonstrates that using raw inter-residue distance information alone with deep learning can predict the quality of protein structural models reasonably well.",

Classical enrichment-style analyses require predefined pathways or gene sets that are tested for significant deregulation to assess whether the pathway is functionally involved in the biological process under study. De novo identification of these pathways can reduce the bias inherent in predefined pathways or gene sets. At the same time, the definition and efficient identification of these pathways de novo from large biological networks is a challenging problem.\n\nResultsWe present a novel algorithm, DeRegNet, for the identification of maximally deregulated subnetworks on directed graphs based on deregulation scores derived from (multi-)omics data. DeRegNet can be interpreted as maximum likelihood estimation given a certain probabilistic model for de-novo subgraph identification. We use fractional integer programming to solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We can show that the approach outperforms related algorithms on simulated data with known ground truths. On a publicly available liver cancer dataset we can show that DeRegNet can identify biologically meaningful subgraphs suitable for patient stratification. DeRegNet is freely available as open-source software.\n\nConclusionThe proposed algorithmic framework and its available implementation can serve as a valuable heuristic hypothesis generation tool contextualizing omics data within biomolecular networks.",

Ectothermic animals may, however, also benefit from increased temperatures via enhanced physiological performance and the suppression of cold-adapted pathogens. Therefore, it is crucial to address how the intensity and timing of naturally occurring or human-induced heat waves affect life-history traits and sexual development in amphibians, to predict future effects of climate change and to minimise risks arising from the application of elevated temperature in disease mitigation. We raised agile frog (Rana dalmatina) and common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles at 19 {degrees}C and exposed them to a simulated heat wave of 28 or 30 {degrees}C for six days during one of three ontogenetic periods (early, mid or late larval development). In agile frogs, exposure to 30 {degrees}C during early larval development increased mortality. Regardless of timing, all heat-treatments delayed metamorphosis, and exposure to 30 {degrees}C decreased body mass at metamorphosis. Furthermore, exposure to 30 {degrees}C during any period and to 28 {degrees}C late in development caused female-to-male sex reversal, skewing sex ratios strongly towards males. In common toads, high temperature only slightly decreased survival and did not influence phenotypic sex ratio, while it reduced metamorph mass and length of larval development. Juvenile body mass measured two months after metamorphosis was not adversely affected by temperature treatments in either species. Our results indicate that heat waves may have devastating effects on amphibian populations, and the severity of these negative consequences, and sensitivity can vary greatly between species and with the timing and intensity of heat. Finally, thermal treatments against cold-adapted pathogens have to be executed with caution, taking into account the thermo-sensitivity of the species and the life stage of animals to be treated.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Understanding the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a highly debatable and unsolved challenge for the scientific communities across the world. A key to dissect the susceptibility profiles of animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is to understand how virus enters into the cells. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 ligands (RBD on spike protein) with its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a critical determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. In this study, we developed and implemented a rigorous computational approach for predicting binding affinity between 299 ACE2 orthologs from diverse vertebrate species and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The findings show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to many vertebrate species carrying evolutionary divergent ACE2, implying a broad host range at the virus entry level, which may contribute to cross-species transmission and further viral evolution. Additionally, the present study facilitated the identification of genetic determinants that may differentiate susceptible from the resistant host species based on the conservation of ACE2-spike protein interacting residues in vertebrate host species known to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, these genetic determinants warrant in vivo experimental confirmation. The molecular interactions associated with varied binding affinity of distinct ACE2 isoforms in a specific bat species were identified using protein structure analysis, implying the existence of diversified susceptibility of bat species to SARS-CoV-2. The findings from current study highlight the importance of intensive surveillance programs aimed at identifying susceptible hosts, particularly those with the potential to transmit zoonotic pathogens, in order to prevent future outbreaks.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The identification of the protein fold class is a challenging problem in structural biology. Recent computational methods for fold prediction leverage deep learning techniques to extract protein fold-representative embeddings mainly using evolutionary information in the form of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as input source. In contrast, protein language models (LM) have reshaped the field thanks to their ability to learn efficient protein representations (protein-LM embeddings) from purely sequential information in a self-supervised manner. In this paper, we analyze a framework for protein fold prediction using pre-trained protein-LM embeddings as input to several fine-tuning neural network models which are supervisedly trained with fold labels. In particular, we compare the performance of six protein-LM embeddings: the LSTM-based UniRep and SeqVec, and the transformer-based ESM-1b, ESM-MSA, ProtBERT, and ProtT5; as well as three neural networks: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), ResCNN-BGRU (RBG), and Light-Attention (LAT). We separately evaluated the pairwise fold recognition (PFR) and direct fold classification (DFC) tasks on well-known benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the combination of transformer-based embeddings, particularly those obtained at amino acid-level, with the RBG and LAT fine-tuning models performs remarkably well in both tasks. To further increase prediction accuracy, we propose several ensemble strategies for PFR and DFC, which provide a significant performance boost over the current state-of-the-art results. All this suggests that moving from traditional protein representations to protein-LM embeddings is a very promising approach to protein fold-related tasks.",

In this study we tested the hypothesis that repeating a well-practiced movement leads to a reduction of movement variability. To operationalize this hypothesis, participants were tested in a center- out reaching task with four different targets, on four different days. To probe the effect of repetition they performed random sequences from one to six movements to the same target. Our findings show that, with repetition, movements are not only initiated earlier but their variability is reduced across the entire movement trajectory. Furthermore, this effect is present within and across the four sessions. Together, our results suggest that movement repetition changes the tradeoff between movement initiation and movement precision.\n\nNew & NoteworthyProfessional athletes practice movements that they have performed thousands of times in training just before it is their turn in a game. Why do they do this? Our results indicate that both initial and endpoint variability reduce with repetition in a short sequence of reaching movements.

However, forward planning is typically computationally costly for the brain and should only be employed when necessary. The explicit calculation of how necessary forward planning will be, is in itself computationally costly. We therefore assumed that the brain generates a mapping from a particular situation to a proxy of planning value to make fast decisions about whether to use forward planning, or not. Moreover, since the state space of real world decision problems can be large, we hypothesized that such a mapping will rely on mechanisms that generalize sets of situations based on shared demand for planning. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study using a novel complex sequential task. Our results indicate that participants abstracted from the set of task features to more generalized control contexts that govern the balancing between forward planning and a simple response strategy. Strikingly, we found that correlations of conflict with response time and with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were dependent on context. This context-dependency might reflect that the cognitive control system draws on category-based cognition, harnessing regularities in control demand across task space to generate control contexts that help reduce the complexity of control allocation decisions.",

Textbook models of the meiosis I substage called pachytene show that nuclei have conspicuous 100-nm-wide, ladder-like synaptonemal complexes (SC), which form between homologous chromosomes. It remains unknown if cells have any other large, meiosis-specific nuclear structures. Here we present cryo-ET analysis of frozen-hydrated budding yeast cells before, during, and after pachytene. We found no evidence for the dense ladder-like structures expected of the SC or the ordered chromatin loops expected to project from their sides. Instead, we found large quantities of 12-nm-wide triple-helices that pack into crystalline bundles. These structures are present in meiotic cells, but not in interphase cells, so we call them meiotic triple helices (MTHs). MTHs are enriched in the nucleus but not enriched in the cytoplasm. Bundles of MTHs form at the same time as SCs in wild-type cells and also in mutant cells that are unable to form SCs. These results suggest that in yeast, SCs are not crystalline and that they coexist with large, previously unreported meiotic machines.",

There is robust evidence that younger observers have access to a reliable measure of their own uncertainty when making visual decisions. This metacognitive ability might be challenged during aging due to increasing sensory noise and decreasing cognitive control resources. We investigated age effects on visual confidence using a confidence forced-choice paradigm. We determined discrimination thresholds for trials in which perceptual judgements were indicated as confident and for those in which they were declined as confident. Younger adults (19-38 years) showed significantly lower discrimination thresholds than older adults (60-78 years). In both age groups, perceptual performance was linked to confidence judgements, but overall results suggest reduced confidence efficiency in older adults. However, we observed substantial variability of confidence effects across all particpants. This variability was closely linked to individual differences in cognitive control capacities, i.e. executive function. Our findings provide evidence for age-related differences in meta-perceptual efficiency that present a specific challenge to perceptual performance in old age. We propose that these age effects are primarily mediated by cognitive control resources, supporting their crucial role for metacognitive efficiency.",

We present here a high-throughput system that enables rapid identification of bacterial pathogens, bCARMEN, which utilizes: (1) modular CRISPR-Cas13-based nucleic acid detection with enhanced sensitivity and specificity; and (2) a droplet microfluidic system that enables thousands of simultaneous, spatially multiplexed detection reactions at nanoliter volumes; and (3) a novel pre-amplification strategy that further enhances sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate bCARMEN is capable of detecting and discriminating 52 clinically relevant bacterial species and several key antibiotic resistance genes. We further develop a proof of principle system for use with stabilized reagents and a simple workflow with optical readout using a cell phone camera, opening up the possibility of a rapid point-of-care multiplexed bacterial pathogen identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this paper, we use a novel primer design method combined with droplet-based CRISPR Cas13 detection to distinguish 52 clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in a single assay. We also apply the method to detect and distinguish a panel of major antibiotic resistance genes, which is of critical importance in this era of rising antibiotic resistance. Finally, we make key advances towards making our diagnostic assay deployable at the point-of-care, with a simplified emulsion-free assay process that uses mobile phone camera for detection and reduces infrastructure/skilled labor requirements.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tilapia tilapinevirus (also known as tilapia lake virus, TiLV) is an important virus responsible for die-off of farmed tilapia globally. Detection and quantification of the virus from environmental DNA/RNA (eDNA/eRNA) using pond water represents a potential, noninvasive routine approach for pathogen monitoring and early disease forecasting in aquaculture systems. Here, we report a simple iron flocculation method for viral concentration from water combined with a newly developed hydrolysis probe quantitative RT-qPCR method for detection and quantification of TiLV. The RT-qPCR method targeting a conserved region of TiLV genome segment 9 has a detection limit of 10 viral copies per {micro}L of template. The method had a 100% analytical specificity and sensitivity for TiLV. The optimized iron flocculation method was able to recover 16.11 {+/-} 3.3% of virus from water samples spiked with viral cultures. During disease outbreak cases from an open-caged system and a closed hatchery system, both tilapia and water samples were collected for detection and quantification of TiLV. The results revealed that TiLV was detected from both clinically sick fish and asymptomatic fish. Most importantly, the virus was successfully detected from water samples collected from different locations in the affected farms e.g. river water samples from affected cages (8.50 x 102 to 2.79 x 104 copies/L) and fish-rearing water samples, sewage, and reservoir (4.29 x 102 to 3.53 x 103 copies/L) from affected and unaffected ponds of the hatchery. In summary, this study suggests that the eRNA detection system using iron flocculation coupled with probe based-RT-qPCR is feasible for concentration and quantification of TiLV from water. This approach might be useful for noninvasive monitoring of TiLV in tilapia aquaculture systems and facilitating appropriate decisions on biosecurity interventions needed.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Changes in environmental conditions are likely to have a complex effect on the growth of plants, their phenology, plant-pollinator interactions, and reproductive success. The current world is facing an ongoing climate change along with other human-induced environmental changes. Most research has focused on the impact of increasing temperature as a major driving force for climate change, but other factors may have important impacts on plant traits and pollination too and these effects may vary between different seasons. In addition, it is likely that the effects of multiple environmental factors, such as increasing temperature, water stress, and nitrogen enrichment are not independent. Therefore, we tested the impact of three key factors - season, water, and nitrogen supply - on plant traits, pollination, and seed production in Sinapis alba (Brassicaceae). Plants were grown in three seasons with two levels of water and nitrogen supply in a factorial design. We collected data on multiple vegetative and floral traits and assessed the response of pollinators in the field. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of growing conditions on seed set in plants exposed to pollinators and in hand-pollinated plants. Our results show that water stress impaired vegetative growth, decreased flower production, reduced visitation by pollinators and seed set, while nitrogen availability played an important role in nectar production. Seasonality modulated the effect of water and nitrogen availability on vegetative and floral traits and strongly affected flowering phenology and flower production. We demonstrated that changes in water and nitrogen availability alter plant vegetative and floral traits, which impacts flower visitation and consequently plant reproduction. We conclude that ongoing environmental changes such as altered precipitation regimes and nitrogen enrichment may thus affect plant-pollinator interactions with negative consequences for the reproduction of wild plants and insect-pollinated crops.",

    "preprint_abstract": "It is well documented that individuals of wild populations can adjust to climate change by means of phenotypic plasticity, but few reports on adaptation by means of genetically based microevolution caused by selection. Disentanglement of these separate effects requires that the reference environment (the environmental zero-point) is defined, and this should not be done arbitrarily. The problem is that an error in the reference environment may lead to large errors in predicted microevolution. Together with parameter values and initial mean trait values, the reference environment can be estimated from environmental, phenotypic and fitness data. A prediction error method for this purpose is described, with the feasibility shown by simulations. As shown in a toy example, an estimated reference environment may have large errors, especially for small populations. This may still be a better choice than use of an initial environmental value in a recorded time series, or the mean value, which is often used. Another alternative may be to use the mean value of a past and stationary stochastic environment, which the population is judged to have been fully adapted to, in the sense that the expected geometric mean fitness was at a global maximum. Exceptions are cases with constant phenotypic plasticity, where the microevolutionary changes per generation follow directly from phenotypic and environmental data, independent of the chosen reference environment.",

This also has implications for active segregation dynamics in membraneless regions within the cytoplasm and nucleus (3d). We formulate an active version of the Flory-Huggins theory that incorporates a contribution from fluctuating active stresses. Apart from knitting together some of our past theoretical work in a comprehensive narrative, we highlight some new results, and establish a correspondence with recent studies on Active Model B/B+. We point to the many unusual aspects of the dynamics of active phase segregation, such as (i) anomalous growth dynamics, (ii) coarsening accompanied by propulsion and coalescence of domains that exhibit nonreciprocal effects, (iii) segregation into mesoscale domains, (iv) emergence of a nonequilibrium phase segregated steady state characterised by strong macroscopic fluctuations (fluctuation dominated phase ordering (FDPO)), and (v) mesoscale segregation even above the equilibrium Tc. Apart from its implications for actively driven segregation of binary fluids, these ideas are at the heart of an Active Emulsion description of the lateral organisation of molecules on the plasma membrane of living cells, whose full molecular elaboration appears elsewhere.",

Here, we characterize multiple facets and drivers of biodiversity to understand how these relate to bioregions and conservation status in the ferns of Japan.\n\nMethodsWe compiled a community dataset of 1,239 20 km x 20 km grid-cells including 672 taxa based on > 300,000 specimen records. We combined this with a phylogeny and functional traits to analyze taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity, and modeled biodiversity metrics in response to environmental factors and reproductive mode. Hierarchical clustering was used to delimit bioregions. Conservation status and threats were assessed by comparing the overlap of significantly diverse grid-cells with conservation zones and range maps of native Japanese deer.\n\nResultsTaxonomic richness was highest at mid-latitudes. Phylogenetic and functional diversity and phylogenetic endemism were highest in small southern islands. Relative phylogenetic and functional diversity were high at high and low latitudes, and low at mid-latitudes. Grid-cells were grouped into three (phylogenetic) or four (taxonomic) major bioregions. Temperature and apomixis were identified as drivers of biodiversity patterns. Conservation status was generally high for grid-cells with significantly high biodiversity, but the threat due to herbivory by deer was greater for taxonomic richness than other metrics.\n\nConclusionsOur integrative approach reveals previously undetected patterns and drivers of biodiversity in the ferns of Japan. Future conservation efforts should recognize that threats can vary by biodiversity metric and consider multiple multiple metrics when establishing conservation priorities.",

Epidemiological studies suggest that among the phylogeographic lineages of Mtb, strains belonging to Lineage 2 (L2) are associated with concerning clinical features including hypervirulence, treatment failure, and vaccine escape. The global expansion and increasing prevalence of L2 has been attributed to the selective advantage conferred by these characteristics, yet confounding host and environmental factors make it difficult to identify the bacterial determinants driving these associations in human studies. Here, we developed a molecular barcoding strategy to facilitate high-throughput, experimental phenotyping of Mtb clinical isolates. This approach allowed us to characterize growth dynamics for a panel of genetically diverse Mtb strains during infection and after vaccination in the mouse model. We found that L2 strains exhibit distinct growth dynamics in vivo and are resistant to the immune protection conferred by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. The latter finding corroborates epidemiological observations and demonstrates that mycobacterial features contribute to vaccine efficacy. To investigate the genetic and biological basis of L2 strains distinctive phenotypes, we performed variant analysis, transcriptional studies, and genome-wide transposon sequencing. We identified functional genetic changes across multiple stress- and host-response pathways in a representative L2 strain that are associated with variants in regulatory genes. These adaptive changes may underlie the distinct clinical characteristics and epidemiological success of this lineage.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cytoplasmic pH is tightly regulated by diverse active mechanisms and interconnected regulatory processes in bacteria. Many processes and regulators underlying pH-homeostasis have been identified via phenotypic screening of strain libraries towards non-growth at low or high pH values. Direct screens with respect to changes of the internal pH in mutant strain collections are limited by laborious methods including fluorescent dyes or radioactive probes. Genetically encoded biosensors equip single organisms or strain libraries with an internal sensor molecule already during the generation of the strain. In this study, we used the pH-sensitive mCherry variant mCherryEA as ratiometric pH biosensor. We visualized the internal pH of E. coli colonies on agar plates by the use of a Gel-Doc imaging system. Combining this imaging technology with robot-assisted colony picking and spotting allowed us to screen and select mutants with altered internal pH values from a small transposon mutagenesis derived E. coli library. Identification of the TN- insertion sites in strains with altered internal pH levels revealed that the transposon was inserted into trkH (encoding a transmembrane protein of the potassium uptake system) or the rssB gene (encoding the anti-adaptor protein RssB which mediates the proteolytic degradation of the general stress response regulator RpoS), two genes known to be associated with pH-homeostasis and pH stress adaptation. This successful screening approach demonstrates that the pH- sensor based analysis of arrayed colonies on agar plates is a sensitive approach for the fast identification of genes involved in pH-homeostasis or pH stress adaptation in E. coli.\n\nImportancePhenotypic screening of strain libraries on agar plates has become a versatile tool to understand gene functions and to optimize biotechnological platform organisms. Screening is supported by genetically encoded biosensors that allow to easily measure intracellular processes. For this purpose, transcription-factor-based biosensors have emerged as the sensor-type of choice. Here, the target stimulus initiates the activation of a response gene (e.g. a fluorescent protein) followed by transcription, translation and maturation. Due to this mechanistic principle, biosensor readouts are delayed and cannot report the actual intracellular state of the cell in real-time. To capture fast intracellular processes adequately, fluorescent reporter proteins are extensively applied. But these sensor-types are not utilized for phenotypic screenings so far. To take advantage of their properties, we here established an imaging method, which allows to apply a fast ratiometric sensor protein for assessing the internal pH of colonies in a high-thoughput manner.",

These ALS mutations are in the intron of Kif5a and induce mis-splicing of KIF5A mRNA, leading to splicing out of exon 27, which in human KIF5A encodes the cargo-binding tail domain of KIF5A. Therefore, it has been suggested that ALS is caused by loss of function of KIF5A. However, the precise mechanisms regarding how mutations in KIF5A cause ALS remain unclear. Here, we show that an ALS-associated mutant of KIF5A, KIF5A({Delta}exon27), is predisposed to form oligomers and aggregates in cultured mouse cell lines. Interestingly, purified KIF5A({Delta}exon27) oligomers showed more active movement on microtubules than wild type KIF5A in vitro. Purified KIF5A({Delta}exon27) was prone to form aggregates in vitro. Moreover, KIF5A({Delta}exon27)-expressing Caenorhabditis elegans neurons showed morphological defects. These data collectively suggest that ALS-associated mutations of KIF5A are toxic gain-of-function mutations rather than simple loss-of-function mutations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Characteristics of the new phenotypic variation introduced via mutation have broad implications in evolutionary and medical genetics. Standardised estimates of this mutational variance, VM, span two orders of magnitude, but the causes of this remain poorly resolved. We investigated estimate heterogeneity using two approaches. First, meta-analyses of ~150 estimates from 37 mutation accumulation (MA) studies did not support a difference among taxa (which differ in mutation rate) in standardised VM, but provided equivocal support for standardised VM to vary with trait type (life history versus morphology, predicted to differ in mutation rate). Notably, several experimental factors were confounded with taxon and trait, and further empirical data are required to resolve their influences. Second, we analysed morphological data from an experiment in Drosophila serrata to determine the potential for unintentional heterogeneity among environments in which phenotypes were measured (i.e., among laboratories or time points) or transient segregation of mutations within MA lines to affect standardised VM. Approximating the size of an average MA experiment, variability among repeated estimates of (accumulated) mutational variance was comparable to variation among published estimates of standardised VM for morphological traits. This heterogeneity was (partially) attributable to unintended environmental variation or within line segregation of mutations only for wing size, not wing shape traits. We conclude that sampling error contributed substantial variation within this experiment, and infer that it will also contribute substantially to differences among published estimates. We suggest a logistically permissive approach to improve the precision of estimates, and consequently our understanding of the dynamics of mutational variance of quantitative traits.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Synthesis of polyphosphate (polyP) is an ancient and universal stress and starvation response in bacteria. In many bacteria, polyP chains come together to form granular superstructures within cells. Some species appear to regulate polyP granule subcellular organization. Despite the critical role of polyP in starvation fitness, the composition of these structures, mechanism(s) underpinning their organization, and functional significance of such organization are poorly understood. We previously determined that granules become transiently evenly spaced on the cells long axis during nitrogen starvation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we developed a granule-enrichment protocol to screen for polyP granule-localizing proteins. We identified AlgP as a protein that associates with polyP granules. We further discovered that AlgP is required for the even spacing of polyP granules. AlgP is a DNA-binding protein with a 154 amino acid C-terminal domain enriched in  KPAA repeats and variants of this repeat, with an overall sequence composition similar to the C-terminal tail of eukaryotic histone H1. Granule size, number, and spacing are significantly perturbed in the absence of AlgP, or when AlgP is truncated to remove the C-terminus. The {Delta}algP and algP{Delta}CTD mutants having fewer, larger granules. We speculate that AlgP may contribute to spacing by tethering polyP granules to the chromosome, thereby inhibiting fusion with neighboring granules. Our discovery that AlgP facilitates granule spacing allows us for the first time to directly uncouple granule biogenesis from even spacing, and will inform future efforts to explore the functional significance of granule organization on fitness during starvation.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe mechanisms underpinning polyPs pleiotropic effects on bacterial starvation physiology remain elusive. This simple polyanions lack of protein binding specificity has impeded validation of bona fide polyP-binding proteins. However, polyP forms granule superstructures with spatial specificity. Our granule enrichment protocol identified a polyP granule-associated protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, AlgP. AlgP was originally reported as regulator of alginate, an extracellular polysaccharide important in biofilm formation, including in cystic fibrosis (CF) chronic infections. AlgPs putative role in alginate biosynthesis has recently been called into question. We establish a distinct, previously unknown function for AlgP in modulating the subcellular organization of polyP, another polymer important for pathogenesis. In CF clinical isolates, the C-terminal repeat domain of AlgP is a hotspot for genetic rearrangements. Our finding that the C-terminus of AlgP is required for granule organization lays the groundwork for exploring the functional significance of these mutations in the evolutionary trajectory of chronic infections.",

The performance of the method is tested using simulated data. Average estimated mutation rates and selection intensities are close to the true values but there is considerable variation about the averages. Allowing for both population growth and population subdivision do not result in qualitative differences but the estimated mutation rates and selection intensities do not in general reflect the current effective population size. The method is applied to three class I (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) and two class II loci (HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1) in the 1000 Genomes populations. Allowing for asymmetric balancing selection has only a slight effect on the results from the symmetric model. Mutations that restore symmetry of the selection model are preferentially retained because of the tendency of natural selection to maximize average fitness. However, slight differences in selective effects result in much longer persistence time of some alleles. Trans-species polymorphism (TSP), which is characteristic of MHC in vertebrates, is more likely when there are small differences in allelic fitness than when complete symmetry is assumed. Therefore, variation in allelic fitness expands the range of parameter values consistent with observations of TSP.",

Freshwater nitrifiers have received little attention, leaving many unanswered questions about their taxonomic distribution, functional potential, and ecological interactions. Here, we reconstructed genomes to infer the metabolism and ecology of free-living picoplanktonic nitrifiers across the Laurentian Great Lakes, a connected series of five of Earths largest lakes. Surprisingly, ammonia oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) related to Nitrosospira dominated over ammonia oxidizing Archaea (AOA) at nearly all stations, with distinct ecotypes prevailing in the transparent, oligotrophic upper lakes compared to Lakes Erie and Ontario. Unexpectedly, one ecotype of Nitrosospira encodes proteorhodopsin, which could enhance survival in conditions where ammonia oxidation is inhibited or substrate limited. Nitrite oxidizing Bacteria (NOB) Ca. Nitrotoga and Nitrospira fluctuated in dominance, with the latter prevailing in deeper, less productive basins. Genome reconstructions reveal highly reduced genomes and features consistent with genome streamlining, along with diverse adaptations to sunlight and oxidative stress and widespread capacity for organic nitrogen use. Our findings expand the known functional diversity of nitrifiers and establish their ecological genomics in large lake ecosystems. By elucidating links between microbial biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, our work also informs ecosystem models of the Laurentian Great Lakes, a critical freshwater resource experiencing rapid environmental change.\n\nImportanceMicroorganisms play critical roles in Earths nitrogen cycle. In lakes, microorganisms called nitrifiers derive energy from reduced nitrogen compounds. In doing so, they transform nitrogen into a form that can ultimately be lost to the atmosphere by a process called denitrification, which helps mitigate nitrogen pollution from fertilizer runoff and sewage. Despite their importance, freshwater nitrifiers are virtually unexplored. To understand their diversity and function, we reconstructed genomes of freshwater nitrifiers across some of Earths largest freshwater lakes, the Laurentian Great Lakes. We discovered several new species of nitrifiers specialized for clear low nutrient waters, and distinct species in comparatively turbid Lake Erie.

    "preprint_abstract": "In July 2016, a severe coral reef invertebrate mortality event occurred approximately 200km southeast of Galveston, Texas at the East Flower Garden Bank wherein upwards of 80% of corals in a 0.06 km2 area died. Based on surveys of dead corals and other invertebrates shortly after this mortality event, responders hypothesized that localized hypoxia was the most likely direct cause. However, no dissolved oxygen data were available to test this hypothesis because oxygen is not continuously monitored within the Flower Garden Banks sanctuary. Here we quantify microbial plankton community diversity based on four cruises over two years at the Flower Garden Banks, including a cruise just 5-8 days after the mortality event was first observed. In contrast with observations collected during baseline conditions, microbial plankton communities in the thermocline were differentially enriched with taxa known to be active and abundant in oxygen minimum zones or that have known adaptations to oxygen limitation shortly after the mortality event (e.g. SAR324, Thioglobaceae, Nitrosopelagicus, and Thermoplasmata MGII). Unexpectedly, these enrichments were not localized to the East Bank, but were instead prevalent across the entire study area, suggesting there was a widespread depletion of dissolved oxygen concentrations in the thermocline around the time of the mortality event. Hydrographic analysis revealed the southern East Bank coral reef (where the localized mortality event occurred) was uniquely within the thermocline at this time. Our results demonstrate how temporal monitoring of microbial communities can be a useful tool to address questions related to past environmental events.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in July 2016, upwards of 80% of corals in a small area of the East Flower Garden Bank coral reef suddenly died without warning. Oxygen depletion is believed to have been the cause. However, there was considerable uncertainty as no oxygen data is available from the time of the event. Microbes are sensitive to changes in oxygen and can be used as bioindicators of oxygen loss. In this study, we analyze microbial communities in water samples collected over several years at the Flower Garden Banks, including shortly after the mortality event. Our findings indicate that compared to normal conditions, oxygen depletion was widespread in the deep-water layer during the mortality event. Hydrographic analysis of water masses further revealed some of this low oxygen water likely upwelled onto the coral reef.",

This study curated an atlas of human viruses from public databases and literatures, and built the Human Virus Database (HVD) available at http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/. The HVD contains 1,131 virus species of 54 viral families which were more than twice the number of the human-infecting virus species reported in previous studies. These viruses were identified in human samples including 68 human tissues, the excreta and body fluid. The viral diversity in humans was age-dependent with a peak in the infant and a valley in the teenager. The tissue range of viruses was found to be associated with several factors including the viral group (DNA, RNA or reverse-transcribing viruses), enveloped or not, viral genome length and GC content, viral receptors and the virus-interacting proteins. Finally, the tissue range of DNA viruses was predicted using a random-forest algorithm with a medium performance. Overall, the study not only provides a valuable resource for further studies of human viruses, but also deepens our understanding towards the diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a saprophyte and a human intracellular pathogen. Upon invasion into mammalian cells, it senses multiple metabolic and environmental signals that collectively trigger its transition to the pathogenic state. One of these signals is the tripeptide glutathione, which acts as an allosteric activator of Lms master virulence regulator, PrfA. While glutathione synthesis by Lm was shown to be critical for PrfA activation and virulence gene expression, it remains unclear how this tripeptide is synthesized under changing environments, especially in light of the observation that Lm is auxotrophic to one of its precursors, cysteine. Here, we show that the ABC transporter TcyKLMN is a cystine/cysteine importer that supplies cysteine for glutathione synthesis, hence mediating the induction of the virulence genes. Further, we demonstrate that this transporter is negatively regulated by three metabolic regulators: CodY, CymR and CysK, which sense and respond to changing concentrations of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and cysteine. The data indicate that under low concentrations of BCAA, TcyKLMN is up-regulated, driving the production of glutathione by supplying cysteine, thereby facilitating PrfA activation. These findings provide molecular insight into the coupling of Lm metabolism and virulence, connecting BCAA sensing to cysteine uptake and glutathione biosynthesis, as a mechanism that controls virulence gene expression. This study exemplifies how bacterial pathogens sense their intracellular environment and exploit essential metabolites as effectors of virulence.\n\nImportanceBacterial pathogens sense the repertoire of metabolites in the mammalian niche and use this information to shift into a pathogenic state to accomplish successful infection. Glutathione is a virulence-activating signal that is synthesized by L. monocytogenes during infection of mammalian cells. In this study, we show that cysteine uptake via TcyKLMN drives glutathione synthesis and virulence gene expression. The data emphasize the intimate cross-regulation between metabolism and virulence in bacterial pathogens.",

We demonstrate how atomistic simulations, typically limited to sub-millisecond durations and zeptoliter volumes, can guide development of a coarse-grained model for use in simulations that mimic experimental assays. We show that, after initially correcting excess attraction between the DNA and protein, qualitative consistency between several experiments and their computational equivalents is achieved, while additionally providing a detailed portrait of the underlying mechanics. Finally the model is used to simulate the trombone loop of a replication fork, a large complex of proteins and DNA.",

While there are many different forms of internal cognition (mind-wandering, recall, imagery etc.), their essential feature is independence from the immediate sensory input. This is thought to be reflected in the decoupling of brain networks from the external stimuli, but a quantitative investigation of this remains outstanding. Here we present a conceptual and analysis framework that links stimulus responses to connectivity between brain networks. This allows us to quantify the coupling of brain networks to the external stimuli. We tested this framework by presenting subjects with an audiovisual stimulus and instructing them to either attend to the stimulus (external task) or engage in mental imagery, recall or arithmetic (internal tasks) while measuring the evoked brain activity using functional MRI. We found that stimulus responses were generally attenuated for the internal tasks, though they increased in a subset of tasks and brain networks. However, using our new measure of coupling, we showed that brain networks became increasingly decoupled from the stimulus, even in the subset of tasks and brain networks in which stimulus responses increased. These results quantitatively demonstrate that during internal cognition brain networks are decoupled from external stimuli, opening the door for a fundamental and quantitative understanding of internal cognition.",

The disease does not have a cure yet, as there are still many aspects of this complex disorder that are not fully understood. While mathematical models can shed light on some of these aspects, to date there are few such models that can be used to better understand the disease. As a first step in the mechanistic understanding of RA, in this study we introduce a new hybrid mathematical modelling framework that describes pannus formation in a small proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. We perform numerical simulations with this new model, to investigate the impact of different levels of immune cells (macrophages and fibroblasts) on the degradation of bone and cartilage. Since many model parameters are unknown and cannot be estimated due to a lack of experiments, we also perform a sensitivity analysis of model outputs to various model parameters (single parameters or combinations of parameters). Finally, we discuss how our model could be applied to investigate current treatments for RA, for example, methotrexate, TNF-inhibitors or tocilizumab, which can impact different model parameters.",

The X-linked gene PCDH19 is associated with sporadic and familial epilepsy in humans, typically with early-onset clustering seizures and intellectual disability in females but not in so-called  carrier males, suggesting that mosaic PCDH19 expression is required to produce epilepsy. To characterize the role of loss of PCDH19 function in epilepsy, we generated zebrafish with truncating pcdh19 variants. Evaluating zebrafish larvae for electrophysiological abnormalities, we observed hyperexcitability phenotypes in both mosaic and non-mosaic pcdh19+/- and pcdh19-/- mutant larvae. Thus, we demonstrate that the key feature of epilepsy--network hyperexcitability--can be modeled effectively in zebrafish, even though overt spontaneous seizure-like swim patterns were not observed. Further, zebrafish with non-mosaic pcdh19 mutation displayed reduced numbers of inhibitory interneurons suggesting a potential cellular basis for the observed hyperexcitability. Our findings in both mosaic and non-mosaic pcdh19 mutant zebrafish challenge the prevailing theory that mosaicism governs all PCDH19-related phenotypes and point to interneuron-mediated mechanisms underlying these phenotypes.",

Yet, empirical evidence for how these interactions impact parasite transmission between host individuals remains scarce. We address this scarcity by using a field mesocosm experiment to investigate the interaction between a systemic fungal endophyte, Epichloe coenophiala, and a fungal parasite, Rhizoctonia solani, in leaves of a grass host, tall fescue. Specifically, we investigated how this interaction impacted parasite transmission under field conditions in replicated experimental host populations. Epichloe-inoculated populations tended to have greater disease prevalence over time, though this difference had weak statistical support. More clearly, Epichloe-inoculated populations experienced higher peak parasite prevalences than Epichloe-free populations. Epichloe conferred a benefit in growth; Epichloe-inoculated populations had greater aboveground biomass than Epichloe-free populations. Using biomass as a proxy, host density was correlated with peak parasite prevalence, but Epichloe still increased peak parasite prevalence after controlling for the effect of biomass. Together, these results suggest that within-host microbial interactions can impact disease at the population level. Further, while Epichloe is clearly a mutualist of tall fescue, it may not be a defensive mutualist in relation to R. solani.",

We evaluated a single-cell RNA-seq glioblastoma dataset (n = 28) and identified a stem cell population co-expressing high levels of embryonic pluripotency markers, named core glioma stem cells (c-GSCs). This embryonic-like population represents 4.22% {+/-} 0.59 of the tumor cell mass, and pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of stemness and downregulation of immune-associated pathways. Using induced pluripotent stem cell technology, we generated an in vitro model of c-GSCs by reprogramming glioblastoma patient-derived cells into induced c-GSCs (ic-GSCs). Immunostaining of ic-GSCs showed high expression of embryonic pluripotency markers and downregulation of antigen presentation HLA proteins, mimicking its tumoral counterpart. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a strong agreement of enriched biological pathways between tumor c-GSCs and in vitro ic-GSCs ({kappa} = 0.71). Integration of ic-GSC DNA methylation and gene expression with chromatin state analysis of epigenomic maps (n = 833) indicated that polycomb repressive marks downregulate HLA genes in stem-like phenotype. Together, we identified c-GSCs as a GBM cell population with embryonic signatures and poor immunogenicity. Genome-scale transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling provide a valuable resource for studying immune evasion mechanisms governing c-GSCs and identifying potential therapeutic targets for GBM immunotherapy.",

The high affinity Copper Transporter 1 (CTR1), being the main in-cell copper (Cu(I)) entry route, tightly regulates its cellular uptake via a still elusive mechanism. Here, all-atoms simulations unlock the molecular terms of Cu(I) transport in eukaryotes disclosing that the two Methionine triads, forming the selectivity filter, play an unprecedented dual role both enabling selective Cu(I) transport and regulating its uptake-rate thanks to an intimate coupling between the conformational plasticity of their bulky side chains and the number of bound Cu(I) ions. Namely, the Met residues act as a gate reducing the Cu(I) import-rate when two ions simultaneously bind to CTR1. This may represent an elegant autoregulatory mechanism through which CTR1 protects the cells from excessively high, and hence toxic, in-cell Cu(I) levels. Overall, these outcomes resolve fundamental questions in CTR1 biology and open new windows of opportunity to tackle diseases associated with an imbalanced copper uptake.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467269v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (64K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75fbe6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ece24eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fda950org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1770038_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Moreover, it is incredibly difficult to directly count cells and accurately measure DIP rates for cell populations in suspension. As an alternative, we use real-time luminescence measurements derived from the cellular activity of NAD(P)H oxidoreductase to efficiently estimate drug response in both adherent and suspension cell populations to a panel of known anticancer agents. For the adherent cell lines, we collect both luminescence reads and direct cell counts over time simultaneously to assess their congruency.

We demonstrate crosstalk between the signalling activity of these two proteins in myeloid cells, and show that modulation of either protein can affect expression of the other. Finally, we demonstrate that WT1 mutations frequently observed in AML can increase stabilise {beta}-catenin and augment Wnt signalling output. This study has uncovered new context-dependent molecular interactions for {beta}-catenin which could inform future therapeutic strategies to target this dysregulated molecule in AML.\n\nArticle summaryO_LI{beta}-Catenin is frequently dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and protein interactions govern its stability, localization and activity, but these are poorly defined in AML.\nC_LIO_LIThis study shows for the first time that {beta}-catenin and Wilms tumour protein (WT1) interact and influence each others expression level and signalling activity in AML cells, which could inform future therapeutic strategies.\nC_LI",

Here, we report successful xeno-free isolation, expansion, and cryopreservation of human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, pericytes and keratinocytes from a single donor. We further demonstrate the bioprinting of a human skin substitute with a dermal layer containing xeno-free cultured human endothelial cells (EC), fibroblasts, and pericytes in a xeno-free bioink containing human collagen type I and fibronectin layered in a biocompatible polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and subsequently seeded with xeno-free human keratinocytes to form an epidermal layer. Following implantation of such bilayered skin grafts on the dorsum of immunodeficient mice, keratinocytes form a mature stratified epidermis with rete ridge-like structures. The ECs and pericytes form human EC-lined perfused microvessels within 2 weeks after implantation, preventing graft necrosis, and eliciting further perfusion of the graft by angiogenic host microvessels. In summary, we describe the fabrication of a bioprinted vascularized bilayered skin substitute under completely xeno-free culture conditions demonstrating feasibility of a xeno-free approach to complex tissue engineering.",

To further define the role of the ESCRT-III associated protein Mos10/Vps60 in ILV formation, we screened for new interaction partners by SILAC/MS. Here, we focused on the newly identified interaction partner Vps68. Our data suggest that Vps68 cooperates with ESCRT-III in ILV formation. The deletion of VPS68 caused a sorting defect similar to the SNF7 deletion, when the cargo load was high. The composition of ESCRT-III was altered, the level of core components was higher and the level of associated proteins was lower in the deletion strain. This suggests that a shift occurs from an active complex to a disassembly competent complex and that this shift is blocked in the{Delta} vps68 strain. We present evidence that during this shift Snf7 is replaced by Mos10. Vps68 has an unusual membrane topology. Two of its potential membrane helices are amphipathic helices localized to the luminal side of the endosomal membrane. Based on this membrane topology we propose that Vps68 and ESCRT-III cooperate in the abscission step by weakening the luminal and cytosolic leaflets of the bilayer at the abscission site.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Epilepsy is a widely spread neurological disease, whose treatment often requires resection of the pathological cortical tissue. Interictal spike analysis observed in the non-invasively collected EEG or MEG data offers an attractive way to localize epileptogenic cortical structures for surgery planning purposes. Interictal spike detection in lengthy multichannel data is a daunting task that is still often performed manually. This frequently limits such an analysis to a small portion of the data which renders the appropriate risks of missing the potentially epileptogenic region. While a plethora of automatic spike detection techniques have been developed each with its own assumptions and limitations, non of them is ideal and the best results are achieved when the output of several automatic spike detectors are combined. This is especially true in the low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To this end we propose a novel biomimetic approach for automatic spike detection based on a constrained mixed spline machinery that we dub as fast parametric curve matching (FPCM). Using the peak-wave shape parametrization, the constrained parametric morphological model is constructed and convolved with the observed multichannel data to efficiently determine mixed spline parameters corresponding to each time-point in the dataset. Then the logical predicates that directly map to verbalized text-book like descriptions of the expected interictal event morphology allow us to accomplish the spike detection task. The results of simulations mimicking typical low SNR scenario show the robustness and high ROC AUC values of the FPCM method as compared to the spike detection performed using more conventional approaches such as wavelet decomposition, template matching or simple amplitude thresholding. Applied to the real MEG and EEG data from the human patients and to rat ECoG data, the FPCM technique demonstrates reliable detection of the interictal events and localization of epileptogenic zones concordant with independent conclusions made by the epileptologist. Since the FPCM is computationally light, tolerant to high amplitude artifacts and flexible to accommodate verbalized descriptions of the arbitrary target morphology, it may complement the existing arsenal of means for analysis of noisy interictal datasets.",

The lack of a chromosome-level assembly impedes the understanding of in-depth genomic architecture and the comparative genomic analysis of A. indica. Here, a high-quality genome assembly of A. indica was constructed using a combination of data from Illumina, PacBio, and Hi-C technology, which is the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of A. indica. The genome size of A. indica is 281 Mb anchored to 14 chromosomes (contig N50=6 Mb and scaffold N50=19 Mb). The genome assembly contained 115 Mb repetitive elements and 25,767 protein-coding genes. Evolutional analysis revealed that A. indica didnt experience any whole-genome duplication (WGD) event after the core eudicot {gamma} event, but some genes and genome segment might undergo recent duplications. The secondary metabolite clusters, TPS genes, and CYP genes were also identified. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that most of the A. indica-specific TPS genes and CYP genes were located on the terpene-related clusters on chromosome 13. It is suggested that chromosome 13 may play an important role in the specific terpene biosynthesis of A. indica. And the gene duplication events may be responsible for the terpene biosynthesis expansion in A. indica. This will shed light on terpene biosynthesis in A. indica and facilitate comparative genomic research of the family Meliaceae.",

Recent advances in HIV-1 immunogen design demonstrated that native-like HIV-1 Envelope (Env) trimers that mimic the structure of virion-associated Env induce neutralization breadth in rabbits and macaques. Here, we describe the development of an IDLV-based HIV-1 vaccine expressing either soluble ConSOSL.UFO.664 or membrane-tethered ConSOSL.UFO.750 native-like Env immunogens with enhanced bNAb epitopes exposure. We show that IDLV can be pseudotyped with properly folded membrane-tethered native-like UFO.750 trimers. After a single IDLV injection in BALB/c mice, IDLV-UFO.750 induced a faster humoral kinetic as well as higher levels of anti-Env IgG compared to IDLV-UFO.664. IDLV-UFO.750 vaccinated cynomolgus macaques developed unusually long-lasting anti-Env IgG antibodies, as underlined by their remarkable half-life both after priming and boost with IDLV. After boosting with recombinant ConM SOSIP.v7 protein, two animals developed neutralization activity against the autologous tier 1B ConS virus mediated by V1/V2 and V3 glycan sites responses. By combining the possibility to display stabilized trimeric Env on the vector particles with the ability to induce sustained humoral responses, IDLVs represent an appropriate strategy for delivering rationally designed antigens to progress towards an effective HIV-1 vaccine.",

Despite the potential of this approach to leverage genetic variability for breeding new maize cultivars exhibiting highly stable symbiosis with PGPB, greenhouse-based HTP platforms are not yet widely used because they are highly expensive; hence, it is challenging to perform HTP studies under a limited budget. In this study, we built a low-cost greenhouse-based HTP platform to collect growth-related image-derived phenotypes. We assessed 360 inbred maize lines with or without PGPB inoculation under nitrogen-limited conditions. Plant height, canopy coverage, and canopy volume obtained from photogrammetry were evaluated five times during early maize development. A plant biomass index was constructed as a function of plant height and canopy coverage. Inoculation with PGPB promoted plant growth. Phenotypic correlations between the image-derived phenotypes and manual measurements were at least 0.6. The genomic heritability estimates of the image-derived phenotypes ranged from 0.23 to 0.54. Moderate-to-strong genomic correlations between the plant biomass index and shoot dry mass (0.24-0.47) and between HTP-based plant height and manually measured plant height (0.55-0.68) across the developmental stages showed the utility of our HTP platform.

Presence-absence variants (PAVs) are extreme cases of such alleles, where a gene present in one haplotype does not exist in another. Since PAVs may result from either birth or death of a gene, PAV genes and their alternative alleles, if available, can represent a basis for rapid intraspecific gene evolution. Here, we traced a possible evolution of PAV genes in the PD1074 and CB4856 C. elegans strains as well as their alternative alleles found in other 14 wild strains, using long-read sequencing technologies. We updated the CB4856 genome by filling 18 gaps and identified 50 novel genes and 7,460 novel isoforms from both strains. We verified 328 PAV genes, out of which 48 were C. elegans-specific. Among these possible newly-born genes, 13 had alternative alleles in other wild strains and, in particular, alternative alleles of three genes showed signatures active transposons. Alternative alleles of four other genes showed another type of signature reflected in accumulation of small insertions or deletions. Our results exemplify that research on gene evolution using both species-specific PAV genes and their alternative alleles is expected to provide new perspectives for how genes evolve.",

Basic and antiviral research on SARS-CoV-2 relies on cellular assays of virus replication in vitro. In addition, accurate detection of virus-infected cells and released virus particles is needed to study virus replication and to profile new candidate antiviral drugs. Here, by flow cytometry, we detect SARS-CoV-2 infection at single cell level and distinguish infected Vero E6 cells from uninfected bystander cells. Furthermore, based on the viral nucleocapsid expression, subpopulations of infected cells that are in an early or late phase of viral replication can be differentiated.

The technique makes it possible to distinguish between infected cells in the early (low N) or late phase (high N) of viral replication. It can also be applied to the different variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2, including the Omicron variant.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are strongly linked on a functional and genetic level. Most work has been focused on neurodevelopmental abnormalities in CHD. Conversely, cardiac abnormalities in ASD have been less studied. In this work we investigate the prevalence of cardiac comorbidities relative to genetic contributors of ASD.\n\nMethodsUsing high frequency ultrasound imaging, we screened 9 mouse models with ASD-related genetic alterations (Arid1b(+/-), Chd8(+/-), 16p11.2 (deletion), Sgsh(+/-), Sgsh(-/-), Shank3 {Delta}exon 4-9(+/-), Shank3 {Delta}exon 4-9(-/-), Fmr1(-/-), Vps13b(+/-)), and pooled wild-type littermates (WT). Using a standardised imaging protocol, we measured heart rate (HR), aorta diameter (AoD), thickness and thickening of the left-ventricular (LV) anterior and posterior walls, LV chamber diameter, fractional shortening, stroke volume and cardiac output, Peak E and A velocity ratio of mitral inflow, Velocity Time Integral (VTI) through the ascending aorta.\n\nResultsMutant groups presented small-scale alterations in cardiac structure and function compared to WTs. A greater number of significant differences was observed among mutant groups than between mutant groups and WTs. Mutant groups differed primarily in measures of structure (LV chamber diameter and anterior wall thickness, HR, AoD). When compared to WTs, they differed in both structure and function (LV anterior wall thickness and thickening, chamber diameter and fractional shortening, HR). The mutant groups with most differences to WTs were 16p11.2 (deletion), Fmrl(-/-), Arid1b(+/-). Among mutant groups, the groups differing most from others were 16p11.2 (deletion), Sgsh(+/-), Fmrl(-/-). Our results broadly recapitulate the associated clinical findings.\n\nLimitationsVarious genetically driven cardiac abnormalities occur early in life, so repeating this work in non-adult mice may be valuable. To identify possible sex differences, we must extend this work to female mice. The downsampling procedure used (total correlation calculation) must be verified. Only indirect comparison between our results and clinical literature is possible due to differing study designs.\n\nConclusionsThe characteristic heterogeneity of ASD was recapitulated in the observed cardiac phenotype. The type of measures (morphological, functional) mutant groups differ in can highlight common underlying mechanisms. Clinically, knowledge of cardiac abnormalities in ASD can be essential as even non-lethal cardiac abnormalities can impact normal development.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The transcription factor RpoS ({sigma}S) of Escherichia coli controls a large number of genes important for tolerance of a variety of stress conditions. IraD promotes the post-translation stability of RpoS by inhibition of RssB, an adaptor protein for ClpXP degradation. We have previously documented DNA damage induction of iraD expression, independent of the SOS response. Both iraD and rpoS are required for tolerance to DNA damaging treatments such as H2O2 and the replication inhibitor azidothymidine in the log phase of growth. Using luciferase gene fusions to the 672 bp iraD upstream region, we show here that both promoters of iraD are induced by AZT. Genetic analysis suggests that both promoters are repressed by DnaA-ATP, partially dependent on a putative DnaA box at -81 bp, and regulated by RIDA (regulatory inactivation of DnaA), dependent on the DnaN processivity clamp. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays we show that purified DnaA protein binds to the iraD upstream region, so DnaA regulation of IraD is likely to be direct. DNA damage induction of iraD during log phase growth is abolished in the dnaA-T174P mutant, suggesting that DNA damage, in some way, relieves DnaA repression, possibly through the accumulation of replication clamps and enhanced RIDA. We demonstrate that the RNA-polymerase associated factor, SspA (stringent starvation protein A), induced by the accumulation of ppGpp, also affects IraD expression, with a positive effect on constitutive expression and a negative effect on AZT-induced expression, in a fashion independent of DnaA.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDNA damage can lead to cell death or genomic instability. Cells have evolved transcriptional responses that sense DNA damage and up-regulate tolerance and repair factors; the LexA/RecA-regulated SOS response in E. coli was the first example of such a system. This work describes an alternative DNA damage response, controlled by DnaA and the IraD post-translational regulator of RpoS. The cellular signals for this response, we propose, are empty replication processivity ({beta}) clamps that accumulate at replication blocks. IraD expression is also regulated by stringent starvation protein, SspA, induced by nutrient deprivation. This SOS-independent DNA damage response integrates a signal of incomplete replication with starvation to modulate expression of genes that promote the completion of replication.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Complex disorders manifest by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Through the construction of genetic modules that consist of highly co-expressed genes, it is possible to identify genes that participate in common biological pathways relevant to specific phenotypes. We have previously developed tools MAGI and MAGI-S for genetic module discovery by incorporating co-expression and protein-interaction networks. Here we introduce an extension to MAGI-S, denoted as Merging Affected Genes into Integrated Networks - Multiple Seeds (MAGI-MS), that permits the user to further specify a disease pathway of interest by selecting multiple seed genes likely to function in the same molecular mechanism. By providing MAGI-MS with pairs of seed genes involved in processes underlying certain classes of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epilepsy, we demonstrate that MAGI-MS can reveal modules enriched in genes relevant to chemical synaptic transmission, glutamatergic synapse, and other functions associated with the provided seed genes.\n\nAvailability and implementationMAGI-MS is free and is available at: https://github.com/jchow32/MAGI-MS",

    "preprint_abstract": "The prehistory of the people of Uruguay is greatly complicated by the dramatic and severe effects of European contact, as with most of the Americas. After the series of military campaigns that exterminated the last remnants of nomadic peoples, Uruguayan official history masked and diluted the former indigenous ethnic diversity into the narrative of a singular people that all but died out. Here we present the first whole genome sequences of the Indigenous people of the region before the arrival of Europeans, from an archaeological site in eastern Uruguay that dates from 2,000 years before present. We find a surprising connection to ancient individuals from Panama and eastern Brazil, but not to modern Amazonians. This result may be indicative of a distinct migration route into South America that may have occurred along the Atlantic coast. We also find a distinct ancestry previously undetected in South America. Though this work begins to piece together some of the demographic nuance of the region, the sequencing of ancient individuals from across Uruguay is needed to better understand the ancient prehistory and genetic diversity that existed before European contact, thereby helping to rebuild the history of the indigenous population of what is now Uruguay.",

However, students from underrepresented groups (UR) are less likely to be mentored or have access to mentors, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. We developed and implemented a workshop, to provide the necessary foundation for students to be better prepared for establishing future mentorships throughout graduate and professional school.\n\nMethodsFaculty well-versed in the area of effective mentorship from multiple universities developed and delivered a 1.5-hour workshop to address the roles of a mentor, especially when it comes to UR students, and how students may effectively work with multiple mentors. This workshop was delivered to a group of students from the HBCU Winston Salem State University, and a pre/post-Likert scale-based survey was administered.\n\nResultsWe analyzed the raw data with nonparametric tests for comparison within paired samples. Wilcoxon matched-pairs and signed-rank tests showed statistically significant growth in student self-ratings related to the workshop learning objectives.\n\nConclusionsThe \"How to Handle More than One Mentor to Achieve Excellence\" workshop was well received as a component of pre-graduate and pre-professional training. Incorporating workshops like this may increase student preparedness around developing and cultivating healthy mentorship relationships throughout STEM training.\n\nEDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVESBy the end of this workshop, learners will be able to:\n\nO_LIDescribe the role of mentors in developing the next generation of trainees.\nC_LIO_LIDescribe current research on mentorship among underrepresented populations.\nC_LIO_LIApply skills on effective communication needed in the development of successful mentorship relationships.\nC_LIO_LIWork with multiple mentors at one time while maintaining solid professional and personal relationships.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Dental caries is caused by dental plaque, a community of micro-organisms embedded in an extracellular polymer matrix as a biofilm on the tooth surface. Natural products that are widely available could be used as an alternative or adjunctive anti-caries therapy. Sometimes, when two products are used together, they yield a more powerful antimicrobial effect than the anticipated additive effect. These synergistic combinations are often better treatment options because individual agents may not have sufficient antimicrobial action to be effective when used alone. Cranberries contain phenolic compounds like proanthocyanidins (PAC) that disrupt biofilm formation. Manuka honey has high concentrations of the agent methylglyoxal, which is cariostatic. Because these agents have varied modes of antimicrobial action, they show potential for possible synergistic effects when paired.\n\nVarious cranberry extracts were tested pairwise with manuka honey or methylglyoxal by well-diffusion assays and 96-well checkerboard assays in the presence of Streptococcus mutans to test for synergy. Synergy was demonstrated in two of the cranberry extracts paired with manuka honey. The synergistic combinations found in this research thus can be considered as candidates for the formulation of a dentifrice that could be used to inhibit the formation of dental plaque and thereby avoid the development of caries.\n\nSignificance and ImpactThe emergence of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents has led to a shortage of options when choosing effective treatment agents. Further, some antibiotics used at therapeutic doses can produce undesired side effects. However, by utilizing synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents, the desired antimicrobial effects can often be produced without subjecting the patient to toxic or irritating doses of individual agents. Streptococcus mutans growth and biofilm formation is a major contributor towards dental caries. In this study, a synergistic combination of Manuka honey and cranberry extracts gives evidence that it can be used as an alternative or adjunctive anti-caries therapy.",

The azole fluconazole is the primary antifungal drug used to treat R/VVC yet isolates from some species have intrinsic resistance to fluconazole, and recurrent infection can occur even with fluconazole-susceptible populations. The second-line broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug, boric acid, is an alternative treatment that has been found to successfully treat complicated VVC infections. Far less is known about how boric acid inhibits growth of yeast isolates in different morphologies compared to fluconazole. We found significant differences in drug resistance and drug tolerance (the ability of a subpopulation to grow slowly in high levels of drug) between C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis isolates, with the specific relationships dependent on both drug and phenotype. Population-level variation for both susceptibility and tolerance was broader for fluconazole than boric acid in all species. Unlike fluconazole, which neither prevented hyphal formation nor disrupted mature biofilms, boric acid inhibited C. albicans hyphal formation and reduced mature biofilm biomass and metabolic activity in all isolates in a dose-dependent manner. Variation in planktonic response did not generally predict biofilm phenotypes. Overall, our findings illustrate that boric acid is broadly effective at inhibiting growth across many isolates and morphologies, which could explain why it is an effective treatment for R/VVC.",

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the leading cause of inherited blindness, is a group of retinal dystrophies characterized by photoreceptor dysfunction and death. The insulin receptor, a key controller of metabolism, also regulates neuronal survival and synaptic formation, maintenance, and activity. Indeed, deficient insulin receptor signaling has been implicated in several brain neurodegenerative pathologies. We present evidence linking impaired insulin receptor signaling with RP. We describe a selective decrease in the levels of the insulin receptor and its downstream effector phospho-S6 in retinal horizontal cell axons in the rd10 mouse model of RP, as well as aberrant synapses between rod photoreceptors and the postsynaptic terminals of horizontal and bipolar cells. A gene therapy strategy to induce sustained proinsulin production restored retinal insulin receptor signaling, by increasing S6 phosphorylation, without peripheral metabolic consequences. Moreover, proinsulin preserved photoreceptor synaptic connectivity and prolonged visual function in electroretinogram and optomotor tests.

Understanding how flexible, natural behaviours like coordinated looking-and-reaching are controlled depends on understanding how neurons in different regions of the brain communicate4. Excitatory multiregional communication recruits neural coherence in a gamma-frequency (40-90 Hz) band5. Inhibitory control mechanisms are also required to flexibly control behaviour6, but little is known about how neurons in one region transiently suppress individual neurons in another to support behaviour. How does neuronal firing in a sender-region transiently suppress firing in a receiver-region? Here, we study inhibitory communication during a flexible, natural behaviour, termed gaze-anchoring, in which saccades are transiently inhibited by coordinated reaches. During gaze-anchoring, we find that neurons in the reach region of the posterior parietal cortex can inhibit neuronal firing in the parietal saccade region to suppress eye movements and improve reach accuracy. Importantly, suppression is transient, only present around the coordinated reach, and greatest when reach neurons fire spikes at a particular phase of beta-frequency (15-25 Hz) activity, not gamma-frequency activity. Our work provides evidence in the activity of single neurons for a novel mechanism of inhibitory communication in which beta-frequency neural coherence transiently inhibits multiregional communication to flexibly coordinate our natural behaviour.",

Unlike the human genome, which features one contemporarily active subfamily, four subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and Tf_I/II) have been amplifying in the mouse genome in the last one million years. Moreover, mouse L1 5UTRs are organized into tandem repeats called monomers, which are separated from ORF1 by a tether domain. In this study, we aim to compare promoter activities across young mouse L1 subfamilies and investigate the contribution of individual monomers and the tether sequence.\n\nResultsWe observed an inverse relationship between subfamily age and the average number of monomers among evolutionarily young mouse L1 subfamilies. The youngest subgroup (A_I and Tf_I/II) on average carry 3-4 monomers in the 5UTR. Using a single-vector dual-luciferase reporter assay, we compared promoter activities across six L1 subfamilies (A_I/II, Gf_I and Tf_I/II/III) and established their antisense promoter activities in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. Using consensus promoter sequences for three subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and Tf_I), we dissected the differential roles of individual monomers and the tether domain in L1 promoter activity. We validated that, across multiple subfamilies, the second monomer consistently enhances the overall promoter activity. For individual promoter components, monomer 2 is consistently more active than the corresponding monomer 1 and/or the tether for each subfamily. Importantly, we revealed intricate interactions between monomer 2, monomer 1 and tether domains in a subfamily-specific manner. Furthermore, using three-monomer 5UTRs, we established a complex nonlinear relationship between the length of the outmost monomer and the overall promoter activity.\n\nConclusionsThe laboratory mouse is an important mammalian model system for human diseases as well as L1 biology. Our study extends previous findings and represents an important step toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling mouse L1 transcription as well as L1s impact on development and disease.",

We developed an approach called EXPLICIT-Kinase to predict the functions of the Arabidopsis kinome. Because the activities of many kinases can be regulated transcriptionally, their gene expression patterns provide clues to their functions. A universal gene expression predictor for Arabidopsis was constructed to predict the expression of 30,172 non-kinase genes based on the expression of 994 protein kinase genes. The model reconstituted highly accurate transcriptomes for diverse Arabidopsis samples. It identified the significant kinases as predictor kinases for predicting the expression of Arabidopsis genes and pathways. Strikingly, these predictor kinases were often known regulators of the related pathways, as exemplified by those involved in cytokinesis, tissue development, and stress responses. Comparative analyses have revealed that portions of these predictor kinases, including the novel ones, are shared and conserved between Arabidopsis and maize. The conservation between species provide additional evidence to support the novel predictor kinases as bona fide regulators of the pathways involved. Thus our approach enables the systematic dissection of the functions of the Arabidopsis kinome.",

C17 displayed an effect on DYRK2 at a single-digit nanomolar IC50 and showed outstanding selectivity for the human kinome containing 467 other human kinases. Using C17 as a chemical probe, we further performed quantitative phosphoproteomic assays and identified several novel DYRK2 targets, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). DYRK2 phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, and the combined treatment of C17 with AKT and MEK inhibitors showed synergistic 4E-BP1 phosphorylation suppression. The phosphorylation of STIM1 by DYRK2 substantially increased the interaction of STIM1 with the ORAI1 channel, and C17 impeded the store-operated calcium entry process. Collectively, these studies further expand our understanding of DYRK2 and provide a valuable tool to further pinpoint its biological function.",

Only two AGOs (AGO1 and AGO2) are expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The transcriptome of Ago mutant mESCs revealed a large and specific set of misregulated genes, compared to other miRNA biogenesis factor mutant cells, suggesting additional functions for the AGOs in stem cells. In this study, we endeavored to understand miRNA-independent roles of the AGOs in gene expression regulation through the integration of multiple datasets. Correlation of Ago mutant differential gene expression with ENCODE histone modification data of WT mESCs revealed that affected genes were regulated by the repressive histone modification H3K27me3. We validated this observation by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing and observed a global loss of H3K27me3 in Ago mutant cells. Nevertheless, this reduction explains only a small part of the specific differential gene expression observed in Ago mutant mESCs. By integrating chromatin accessibility data in conjunction with prediction of transcription factor binding sites, we identified differential binding for five transcription factors, including KLF4 as a key modulator of more than half of the specific misregulation of gene expression in the absence of AGO proteins. Our findings illustrate that in addition to chromatin state, information about transcription factor binding is more revelatory in understanding the multi-layered mechanism adopted by cells to regulate gene expression. These data also highlight the importance of an integrative approach to unravel the variety of noncanonical functions of AGOs in mESCs.",

The self-association of the respective transmembrane domains (TMD) has also been suggested to be responsible for the micron-scaled patterns seen for integral membrane proteins in the budding yeast plasma membrane. However, the underlying interplay between local lipid composition and TMD identity is still not mechanistically understood. In this work we combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of simplified bilayer systems with high resolution live-cell microscopy to analyze the distribution of a representative helical yeast TMD from the PM sensor Slg1 within different lipid environments. In our simulations we specifically evaluated the effects of acyl chain saturation and anionic lipids head groups on the association of two TMDs. We found that weak lipid-protein interactions significantly affect the configuration of TMD dimers and the free energy of association. Increased amounts of unsaturated phospholipids strongly reduced helix-helix interaction, while the presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) hardly affected dimer formation. We could experimentally confirm this surprising lack of effect of PS using the network factor, a mesoscopic measure of PM pattern formation in yeast cells. Simulations also showed that formation of TMD dimers in turn increased the order parameter of the surrounding lipids and induced long-range perturbations in lipid organization. In summary, our results shed new light on the mechanisms for lipid-mediated dimerization of TMDs in complex lipid mixtures.",

Questions have been raised as to whether this represents a true endosymbiotic relationship. However, recent definitive evidence for two distinct, high-density strains of supergroup B Wolbachia within A. demeilloni and A. moucheti has opened exciting possibilities to explore naturally occurring Wolbachia endosymbionts in Anopheles for biocontrol strategies to block Plasmodium transmission. Here we utilise genomic analyses to demonstrate that both Wolbachia strains have retained all key metabolic and transport pathways despite their smaller genome size. We further confirm the presence of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor genes, despite noticeably few prophage regions. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis indicates that these Wolbachia strains may have been introduced into these two Anopheles species via horizontal transmission events, and unlikely to be by ancestral acquisition and subsequent loss events in the Anopheles gambiae species complex. These are the first Wolbachia genomes that enable us to study the relationship between natural strains Plasmodium malaria parasites and their Anopheline hosts.\n\nImpact statementWolbachia naturally infects a wide range of arthropod species, including insect vectors of human pathogens, where they may play a role in inhibiting their replication. These bacteria have been commonly found within Aedes (Ae.) albopictus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes but have been noticeably absent in the Anopheles mosquito genera, which includes all species responsible for malaria transmission. Recent PCR-based methods have suggested the potential for natural Wolbachia strains within the A. gambiae species complex, which includes major malaria vector species including A. gambiae s.s., A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis. We recently reported the presence of stable Wolbachia strains naturally occurring within two different Anopheles species (A. demeilloni and A. moucheti). In this study, we perform comparative genomic analysis of these two Wolbachia genomes against each other and published Wolbachia strains. The current assemblies are some of the smallest sequenced Wolbachia strains of insects, although their metabolic pathway repertoire is comparable to other strains. Interestingly, prophage fragments were identified within only one of the two strains. The findings of this study will be of significant interest to researchers investigating Wolbachia as a potential malaria biocontrol strategy, giving greater insight into the evolution and diversity of this obligate intracellular endosymbiont.\n\nData summarySequence data generated and used for this analysis are available in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (NCBI SRA bioproject number PRJNA642000). The two assembled Wolbachia genomes are available with genome accession numbers GCA_018491735.2 and GCA_018491625.2. Additional Wolbachia genomes used for comparative analysis are described in the supplementary material.\n\nThe authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.

    "preprint_abstract": "Intracellular transfers of mitochondrial DNA continue to shape nuclear genomes. Chromosome 2 of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains one of the largest known nuclear insertions of mitochondrial DNA (numts). Estimated at over 600 kb in size, this numt is larger than the entire Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome. The primary Arabidopsis nuclear reference genome contains less than half of the numt because of its structural complexity and repetitiveness. Recent datasets generated with improved long-read sequencing technologies (PacBio HiFi) provide an opportunity to finally determine the accurate sequence and structure of this numt. We performed a de novo assembly using sequencing data from recent initiatives to span the Arabidopsis centromeres, producing a gap-free sequence of the Chromosome 2 numt, which is 641-kb in length and has 99.933% nucleotide sequence identity with the actual mitochondrial genome. The numt assembly is consistent with the repetitive structure previously predicted from fiber-based fluorescent in situ hybridization. Nanopore sequencing data indicate that the numt has high levels of cytosine methylation, helping to explain its biased spectrum of nucleotide sequence divergence and supporting previous inferences that it is transcriptionally inactive. The original numt insertion appears to have involved multiple mitochondrial DNA copies with alternative structures that subsequently underwent an additional duplication event within the nuclear genome. This work provides insights into numt evolution, addresses one of the last unresolved regions of the Arabidopsis reference genome, and represents a resource for distinguishing between highly similar numt and mitochondrial sequences in studies of transcription, epigenetic modifications, and de novo mutations.\n\nSignificance statementNuclear genomes are riddled with insertions of mitochondrial DNA. The model plant Arabidopsis has one of largest of these insertions ever identified, which at over 600-kb in size represents one of the last unresolved regions in the Arabidopsis genome more than 20 years after the insertion was first identified. This study reports the complete sequence of this region, providing insights into the origins and subsequent evolution of the mitochondrial DNA insertion and a resource for distinguishing between the actual mitochondrial genome and this nuclear copy in functional studies.",

Catalase, a heme-containing tetramer protein expressed universally in most of the aerobic bacteria, plays an indispensable role in scavenging excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, through utilization of wild-type and catalase-deficient mutants, we identified catalase as an endogenous therapeutic target of 400-420 nm blue light. Catalase residing in bacteria could be effectively inactivated by blue light, subsequently rendering the pathogens extremely vulnerable to H2O2 and H2O2-producing agents. As a result, photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2 synergistically eliminate a wide range of catalase-positive planktonic bacteria and P. aeruginosa inside biofilms. In addition, photoinactivation of catalase is shown to facilitate macrophages to defend against intracellular pathogens. The antimicrobial efficacy of catalase photoinactivation is further validated using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced mice abrasion model. Taken together, our findings offer a catalase-targeting phototherapy against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The lysine-63 deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) is long recognized as a tumor suppressor in immunity and inflammation and its loss-of-function mutations lead to familial cylindromatosis. However, recent studies reveal that CYLD is enriched in mammalian brain postsynaptic densities, and a gain-of-function mutation causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD), suggesting critical roles at excitatory synapses. Here we report that CYLD drives synapse elimination and weakening by acting on the Akt-mTOR-autophagy axis. Mice lacking CYLD display abnormal sociability, anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and cognitive inflexibility. These behavioral impairments are accompanied by excessive synapse numbers, increased postsynaptic efficacy, augmented synaptic summation, and impaired NMDA receptor-dependent hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). Exogenous expression of CYLD results in removal of established dendritic spines from mature neurons in a deubiquitinase activity-dependent manner. In search of underlying molecular mechanisms, we find that CYLD knockout mice display marked overactivation of Akt and mTOR and reduced autophagic flux and, conversely, CYLD overexpression potently suppresses Akt and mTOR activity and promotes autophagy. Consequently, abrogating the Akt-mTOR-autophagy signaling pathway abolishes CYLD-induced spine loss, whereas enhancing autophagy in vivo by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rescues the synaptic pruning and LTD deficits in mutant mice. Our findings establish CYLD, via Akt-mTOR signaling, as a synaptic autophagy activator that exerts critical modulations on synapse maintenance, function, and plasticity.",

We trapped endogenous human TRiC with substrates (actin, tubulin) and co-chaperone (PhLP2A) at different folding stages, for structure determination by cryogenic electron microscopy. The already-folded regions of client proteins are anchored at the chamber wall, positioning unstructured regions towards the central space to achieve their folding. Substrates engage with different sections of the chamber during the folding cycle, coupled to TRiC open-and-close transitions.

    "preprint_abstract": "Language and social cognition, especially the ability to reason about mental states, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), are deeply related in development and everyday use. However, whether these cognitive faculties rely on distinct, overlapping, or the same mechanisms remains debated. Some evidence suggests that, by adulthood, language and ToM draw on largely distinct--though plausibly interacting--cortical networks. However, the broad topography of these networks is similar, and some have emphasized the importance of social content / communicative intent in the linguistic signal for eliciting responses in the language areas. Here, we combine the power of individual-subjects functional localization with the naturalistic-cognition inter-subject correlation approach to illuminate the language-ToM relationship. Using fMRI, we recorded neural activity as participants (n=43) listened to stories and dialogs with mental state content (+linguistic, +ToM), viewed silent animations and live action films with mental state content but no language (-linguistic, +ToM), or listened to an expository text (+linguistic, -ToM). The ToM network robustly tracked stimuli rich in mental state information regardless of whether mental states were conveyed linguistically or non-linguistically, while tracking a +linguistic/-ToM stimulus only weakly. In contrast, the language network tracked linguistic stimuli more strongly than a) non-linguistic stimuli, and than b) the ToM network, and showed reliable tracking even for the linguistic condition devoid of mental state content. These findings suggest that in spite of their indisputably close links, language and ToM dissociate robustly in their neural substrates--and thus plausibly cognitive mechanisms--including during the processing of rich naturalistic materials.",

    "preprint_abstract": "East Coast fever, a tick-borne cattle disease caused by the Theileria parva parasite, is among the biggest natural killers of cattle in East Africa, leading to over 1 million deaths annually. Here we report on the genetic analysis of a cohort of Boran cattle demonstrating heritable tolerance to infection by T. parva (h2 = 0.65, s.e. 0.57). Through a linkage analysis we identify a 6 Mb genomic region on Bos taurus chromosome 15 that is significantly associated with survival outcome following T. parva exposure. Testing this locus in an independent cohort of animals replicates this association with survival following T. parva infection. A stop gained polymorphism in this region was found to be highly associated with survival across both related and unrelated animals, with only one of the 20 homozygote carriers (T/T) of this change succumbing to the disease in contrast to 44 out of 97 animals homozygote for the reference allele (C/C). Consequently, we present a genetic locus linked to tolerance of one of Africas most important cattle diseases, raising the promise of marker-assisted selection for cattle that are less susceptible to infection by T. parva.\n\nAuthor SummaryMore than a million cattle die of East Coast fever in Africa each year, the impact of which disproportionately falls onto low-income, smallholder farmers. The lack of a widely accessible vaccine, heavy reliance on chemicals to control the tick vector and inadequate drug treatments means that new approaches for controlling the disease are urgently required. Through a genetic study of an extended pedigree of Boran cattle that are more than three times less likely to succumb to the disease than matched controls, we identify a region on chromosome 15 of the cattle genome associated with a high level of tolerance to the disease. We show that a variant in this region is also associated with survival in an independent cohort, and is linked to rates of cell expansion during infection. This genetic variant can therefore support marker-assisted selection, allowing farmers to breed tolerant cattle and offers a route to introduce this beneficial DNA to non-native breeds, enabling reduced disease incidence and increased productivity, which would be of benefit to millions of rural smallholder farmers across Africa.",

In the Omicron variant, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein is heavily mutated, a feature critical for the transmission rate of the virus by interacting with hACE2. In this study, we used a combination of conventional and advanced neural network-based in silico approaches to predict how these mutations would affect the spike protein. The results demonstrated a decrease in the electrostatic potentials of residues corresponding to receptor recognition sites, an increase in the alkalinity of the protein, a change in hydrophobicity, variations in functional residues, and an increase in the percentage of alpha-helix structure. Our next step was to predict the structural changes of the spike protein using the AI-based tool Alphafold2 and dock it with hACE2. The results revealed that the RBD of the Omicron variant had a higher affinity than the reference. Moreover, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations concluded that the RBD of the Omicron variant exhibits a more dispersed interaction network since mutations resulted in an increased number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with hACE2 compared to the reference RBD. In summary, our current study highlighted the potential structural basis for the enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity of the Omicron variant, although further research is needed to investigate its epidemiological and biological implications.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding speciation has long been a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. It is widely accepted that speciation requires an interruption of gene flow to generate strong reproductive isolation between species, in which sexual selection may play an important role by generating and maintaining sexual dimorphism. The mechanism of how sexual selection operated in speciation with gene flow remains an open question and the subject of many research. Two species in genus Chrysolophus, Golden pheasant (C. pictus) and Lady Amhersts pheasant (C. amherstiae), which both exhibit significant plumage dichromatism, are currently parapatric in the southwest China with several hybrid recordings in field.\n\nMethodsIn this research, we estimated the pattern of gene flow during the speciation of two pheasants using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method based on the multiple genes data. With a new assembled de novo genome of Lady Amhersts pheasant and resequencing of widely distributed individuals, we reconstructed the demographic history of the two pheasants by pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC).\n\nResultsThe results provide clear evidence that the gene flow between the two pheasants were consistent with the prediction of isolation with migration model for allopatric populations, indicating that there was long-term gene flow after the initially divergence (ca. 2.2 million years ago), and further support the secondary contact when included the parapatric populations since around 30 ka ongoing gene flow to now, which might be induced by the population expansion of the Golden pheasant in late Pleistocene.\n\nConclusionsThe results of the study support the scenario of speciation between Golden pheasant (C. pictus) and Lady Amhersts pheasant (C. amherstiae) with cycles of mixing-isolation-mixing due to the dynamics of natural selection and sexual selection in late Pleistocene that provide a good research system as evolutionary model to test reinforcement selection in speciation.",

However, the commonly used DREADD ligand, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), has metabolic and off-target effects that may confound experimental results and interpretations. Moreover, CNO has relatively poor affinity for DREADD receptors, which necessitates high doses for systemic administration applications. New DREADD ligands aim to reduce metabolic and potential off-target effects while maintaining strong efficacy for the designer receptors. Recently a novel DREADD ligand, deschloroclozapine (DCZ), was shown to induce chemogenetic-mediated cellular and behavioral effects in mice and monkeys without detectable side effects. While promising, further testing of DCZ across species and experimental paradigms is warranted. The goal of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of systemic DCZ for DREADD-based chemogenetic manipulations in behavioral and slice electrophysiological applications in rats. We demonstrate that a relatively low dose of DCZ (0.1 mg/kg) supports excitatory DREADD-mediated cFos induction, DREADD-mediated inhibition of a central amygdala-dependent behavior, and DREADD-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity in a slice electrophysiology preparation. In addition, we show that this dose of DCZ does not alter gross locomotor activity or induce a place preference/aversion in control rats without DREADD expression. Together, our findings support the use of systemic DCZ for DREADD-based manipulations in rats, and provide evidence that DCZ is a superior alternative to CNO.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Nonenzymatic template-directed RNA copying using chemically activated nucleotides is thought to have played a key role in the emergence of genetic information on the early Earth. A longstanding question concerns the number and nature of different environments that might have been necessary to enable all of the steps from nucleotide synthesis to RNA replication. Here we explore three sequential steps from this overall pathway: nucleotide activation, synthesis of imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides, and template-directed primer extension. We find that all three steps can take place in one reaction mixture, under conditions of multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Recent experiments have demonstrated a potentially prebiotic methyl isocyanide-based nucleotide activation chemistry. Unfortunately, the original version of this approach is incompatible with nonenzymatic RNA copying because the high required concentration of the imidazole activating group prevents the accumulation of the essential imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide needed for primer extension. Here we report that ice eutectic phase conditions facilitate not only the methyl isocyanide-based activation of ribonucleotide 5'-monophosphates with stoichiometric 2-aminoimidazole, but also the subsequent conversion of these activated mononucleotides into imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides. Furthermore, this one pot approach is compatible with template-directed primer extension in the same reaction mixture. Our results suggest that the simple and common environmental fluctuation of freeze-thaw cycles could have played an important role in prebiotic nucleotide activation and nonenzymatic RNA copying.\n\nSignificance StatementThe replication of RNA without the aid of evolved enzymes may have enabled the inheritance of useful molecular functions during the origin of life. Several key steps on the path to RNA replication have been studied in isolation, including chemical nucleotide activation, synthesis of a key reactive intermediate, and nonenzymatic RNA copying. Here we report a prebiotically plausible scenario under which these reactions can happen together under mutually compatible conditions. Thus, this pathway could potentially have operated in nature without the complicating requirement for exchange of materials between distinct environments.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Lysosomes are the digestive center of the cell and play important roles in human disease, including cancer. Previous work has suggested that late endosomes, also known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and lysosomes are essential for canonical Wnt pathway signaling. Sequestration of Glycogen Synthase 3 (GSK3) and of {beta}{square}catenin destruction complex components in MVBs is required for sustained canonical Wnt signaling. Little is known about the role of lysosomes during early development. In the Xenopus egg, a Wnt-like cytoplasmic determinant signal initiates formation of the body axis following a cortical rotation triggered by sperm entry. Here we report that cathepsin D was activated in lysosomes specifically on the dorsal marginal zone of the embryo at 64-cell stage, long before zygotic transcription starts. Expansion of the multivesicular body (MVB) compartment with low-dose Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) greatly potentiated the dorsalizing effects of the Wnt agonist Lithium chloride (LiCl) in embryos, and this effect required macropinocytosis. Formation of the dorsal axis required lysosomes, as indicated by brief treatments with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) Bafilomycin A1 inhibitor at the 32-cell stage. Inhibiting the MVB-forming machinery with a dominant-negative point mutation in Vacuolar Protein Sorting 4 (Vps4-EQ) also interfered with the endogenous dorsal axis. The Wnt-like activity of the dorsal cytoplasmic determinant Huluwa (Hwa), and that of microinjected xWnt8 mRNA, also required lysosome acidification and the MVB-forming machinery. We conclude that lysosome function is essential for early dorsal axis development in Xenopus. The results highlight the intertwining between membrane trafficking, lysosomes, and vertebrate axis formation.\n\nSignificanceThe dorsal axis of the vertebrate Xenopus embryo is established by an early Wnt signal generated by a rotation of the cortex of the egg towards the opposite side of the sperm entry point. In this study, we report that lysosomal Cathepsin D becomes activated on the dorsal marginal zone of the embryo already at the 64-cell stage, and that this asymmetry is enhanced by increasing Wnt signaling levels. We present experiments showing that lysosome activity, macropinocytosis, and multivesicular body formation are required for the dorsal signal provided maternally in the egg, and for twinning by microinjected huluwa and Wnt8 mRNA. The results indicate that the cell biology of lysosomes plays a fundamental role in vertebrate development.",

To reach their destination, cells must overcome the resistance imposed by complex microenvironments, composed of neighboring cells and extracellular matrix (ECM)4-6. While migration through pores and tracks in ECM has been well studied 4,5,7, little is known about cellular traversal into confining cell-dense tissues. Here by combining quantitative live imaging with genetic and optogenetic perturbations we identify a crucial role for cell division during cell migration into tissues. We find that normal embryonic invasion by Drosophila macrophages between the ectoderm and mesoderm8,9 absolutely requires division of an epithelial ectodermal cell at the site of entry. Dividing ectodermal cells disassemble ECM attachment formed by Integrin-mediated focal adhesions next to mesodermal cells, allowing macrophages to move their nuclei ahead and invade. Decreasing or increasing the frequency of ectodermal division correspondingly either hinders or promotes macrophage invasion. Reducing the levels of focal adhesion components in the ectoderm allows macrophage entry even in the absence of division. Our study demonstrates the critical importance of division at the entry site to enable in vivo cell invasion by relieving the steric impediment caused by focal adhesions. We thus provide a new perspective on the regulation of cellular movement into tissues.",

In the past, their detection was restricted to cytological approaches, then to NGS read size and partitionned assemblies. Due to the current capabilities of technologies such as long read sequencing and optical mapping, larger SVs detection are becoming more and more accessible.\n\nThis study proposes a comparison in SVs detection and characterization from long-read sequencing obtained with the MinION device developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies and from optical mapping produced by the Saphyr device commercialized by Bionano Genomics. The genomes of the two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Landsberg erecta 1 (Ler-1) were chosen to guide the use of one or the other technology.\n\nResultsWe described the SVs detected from the alignment of the best ONT assembly and DLE-1 optical maps of A. thaliana Ler-1 on the public reference Col-0 TAIR10.1. After filtering, 1 184 and 591 Ler-1 SVs were retained from ONT and BioNano technologies respectively. A total of 948 Ler-1 ONT SVs (80.1%) corresponded to 563 Bionano SVs (95.3%) leading to 563 common locations in both technologies. The specific locations were scrutinized to assess improvement in SV detection by either technology. The ONT SVs were mostly detected near TE and gene features, and resistance genes seemed particularly impacted.\n\nConclusionsStructural variations linked to ONT sequencing error were removed and false positives limited, with high quality Bionano SVs being conserved. When compared with the Col-0 TAIR10.1 reference, most of detected SVs were found in same locations. ONT assembly sequence leads to more specific SVs than Bionano one, the later being more efficient to characterize large SVs. Even if both technologies are obvious complementary approaches, ONT data appears to be more adapted to large scale populations study, while Bionano performs better in improving assembly and describing specificity of a genome compared to a reference.",

Aggregation may occur as proteins emerge from the ribosome or after they fold and accumulate in the cell, but the relative importance of these two routes remain poorly known. Here, we systematically probed the solubility limits of each Escherichia coli protein upon overexpression using an image-based screen coupled with machine learning. The analysis suggests that competition between folding and aggregation from the unfolded state governs the two aggregation routes. Remarkably, the majority (70%) of insoluble proteins have low supersaturation risks in their unfolded states and rather aggregate after folding. Furthermore, a substantial fraction ([~]35%) of the proteome remain soluble at concentrations much higher than those found naturally, indicating a large margin of safety to tolerate gene expression changes. We show that high disorder content and low surface stickiness are major determinants of high solubility and are favored in abundant bacterial proteins. Overall, our proteome-wide study provides empirical insights into the molecular determinants of protein aggregation routes in a bacterial cell.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Chromatin is spatially organized into functional states that are defined by both the presence of specific histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and a defined set of chromatin-associated  reader proteins. Different models for the underlying mechanism of such compartmentalization have been proposed, including liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of chromatin-associated proteins to drive spatial organization. Heterochromatin, characterized by lysine 9 methylation on histone H3 (H3K9me3) and the presence of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) as a multivalent reader, represents a prime example of a spatially defined chromatin state. Heterochromatin foci exhibit features of protein condensates driven by LLPS; however, the exact nature of the physicochemical environment within heterochromatin in different cell types is not completely understood. Here, we present tools to interrogate the environment of chromatin sub-compartments in the form of modular, cell-permeable, multivalent and fluorescent peptide probes. These probes can be tuned to target specific chromatin states by providing binding sites to reader proteins and can thereby integrate into the PTM-reader interaction network. As a target, here we generate probes specific to HP1, directing them to heterochromatin at chromocenters in mouse fibroblasts. Moreover, we use a polarity-sensing photoactivatable probe that photoconverts to a fluorescent state in phase-separated protein droplets and thereby reports on the local microenvironment. Equipped with this dye, our probes indeed turn fluorescent in murine chromocenters. However, image analysis and single-molecule tracking experiments reveal that the compartments are less dense and more dynamic than HP1 condensates obtained in vitro. Our results thus demonstrate that the local organization of heterochromatin in chromocenters is internally more complex than an HP1 condensate.",

Flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) held in intensive conditions in the Mediterranean region, display a severe reproductive dysfunction, where males do not produce fluent milt and females are arrested at previtellogenesis or early stages of vitellogenesis. In the present study, weekly injections of species-specific single-chain recombinant gonadotropins (rGths); follicle stimulating hormone (rFsh) (6 to 12 g kg-1 doses) and luteinizing hormone (rLh) (2.5 to 24 g kg-1 doses) were administered to induce vitellogenesis, from previtellogenesis / early vitellogenesis to the completion of vitellogenic growth in females and enhance spermatogenesis to produce adequate volumes of sperm from non-fluent males. During the experiment, all treated females (n = 21) developed oocytes in late vitellogenesis with 603 {+/-} 8 m diameter and all treated males produced fluent sperm. To induce oocyte maturation, ovulation and spawning, females were treated with either (i) a priming dose of 30 g kg-1 of rLh and a resolving dose of 40 mg kg-1 of progesterone (P4), (ii) priming and resolving doses of 30 g kg-1 of rLh, or (iii) priming and resolving doses of 40 mg kg-1 of P4 given 24:05 {+/-} 0:40 h apart. Females were placed in spawning tanks with rGth treated males that had fluent sperm. Spontaneous spawns of fertilised eggs were obtained after inducing with rLh + P4 or rLh + rLh (priming and resolving injections) with a spawning success of the 85% (8 of 9 females) and 100% (n = 6), respectively. The eggs collected from the tanks presented 64 {+/-} 22% fertilization with embryo development and 57 {+/-} 24 % hatching. The treatment P4 + P4 had a lower ovulation success (50 % - 3 of 6 females) and spawning success (17 %) with no fertilised eggs. Success was independent of the initial gonadal stage of females. In comparison, control females did not show any advance in gonadal development from initial stages and control males did not produce fluent sperm. The present results confirm the possibility of controlling oogenesis from previtellogenesis to the completion of maturation and fertilised tank spawning using exclusively rFsh and rLh in a teleost species.",

Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a reversible, covalent inhibitor targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the active protease inhibitor in PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets). We evaluated the in vitro catalytic activity and in vitro potency of nirmatrelvir against the main protease (Mpro) of prevalent variants of concern (VOC) or variants of interest (VOI): Alpha (, B.1.1.7), Beta ({beta}, B.1.351), Delta ({delta}, B1.617.2), Gamma ({gamma}, P.1), Lambda ({lambda}, B.1.1.1.37/C37), Omicron (o, B.1.1.529) as well as the original Washington or wildtype strain. These VOC/VOI carry prevalent mutations at varying frequencies in the Mpro specifically for: , {beta},{gamma} (K90R), {lambda} (G15S) and o (P132H). In vitro biochemical enzymatic assay characterization of the enzyme kinetics of the mutant Mpros demonstrate that they are catalytically comparable to wildtype. Nirmatrelvir has similar potency against each mutant Mpro including P132H that is observed in the Omicron variant with a Ki of 0.635 nM as compared to a Ki of 0.933nM for wildtype. The molecular basis for these observations were provided by solution-phase structural dynamics and structural determination of nirmatrelvir bound to the o, {lambda} and {beta} Mpro at 1.63 - 2.09 [A] resolution. These in vitro data suggest that PAXLOVID has the potential to maintain plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir many-fold times higher than the amount required to stop the SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI, including Omicron, from replicating in cells (1).",

    "preprint_abstract": "Temporal variation of environmental stimuli leads to changes in gene expression. Since the latter is noisy and since many reaction events occur between the birth and death of an mRNA molecule, it is of interest to understand how a stimulus affects the transcript numbers measured at various sub-cellular locations. Here, we construct a stochastic model describing the dynamics of signal-dependent gene expression and its propagation downstream of transcription. For any time-dependent stimulus and assuming bursty gene expression, we devise a procedure which allows us to obtain time-dependent distributions of mRNA numbers at various stages of its life-cycle, e.g. in its nascent form at the transcription site, post-splicing in the nucleus, and after it is exported to the cytoplasm. We also derive an expression for the error in the approximation whose accuracy is verified via stochastic simulation. We find that, depending on the frequency of oscillation and the time of measurement, a stimulus can lead to cytoplasmic amplification or attenuation of transcriptional noise.",

We demonstrate the use of formal reasoning methods as applied to the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line, which is an accessible model system for stem cell research. The dynamics of the underlying genetic networks and their potential regulatory interactions are key for understanding mechanisms that control cellular decision-making between stem cells and differentiation. We model the \"stem cell fate\" versus entry into the \"meiotic development\" pathway decision circuit in the young adult germ line based on an extensive study of published experimental data and known/hypothesized genetic interactions. We apply a formal reasoning framework to derive predictive networks for control of differentiation. Using this approach we simultaneously specify many possible scenarios and experiments together with potential genetic interactions, and synthesize genetic networks consistent with all encoded experimental observations. In silico analysis of knock-down and overexpression experiments within our model recapitulate published phenotypes of mutant animals and can be applied to make predictions on cellular decision-making. This work lays a foundation for developing realistic whole tissue models of the C. elegans germ line where each cell in the model will execute a synthesized genetic network.",

We investigated whether adolescents are uniquely adapted to this transition, compared to younger children and adults. In a stochastic, volatile reversal-learning task with a sample of 291 participants aged 8-30, we found that adolescents outperformed both younger and older participants. We developed two independent cognitive models, based on Reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian inference (BI). The RL parameter for learning from negative outcomes and the BI parameters specifying participants mental models peaked closest to optimal in adolescents, suggesting a central role in adolescent cognitive processing. By contrast, persistence and noise parameters improved monotonously with age. We distilled the insights of RL and BI using principal component analysis and found that three shared components interacted to form the adolescent performance peak: adult-like behavioral quality, child-like time scales, and developmentally-unique processing of positive feedback. This research highlights adolescence as a neurodevelopmental window that may be specifically adapted for volatile and uncertain environments. It also shows how detailed insights can be gleaned by using cognitive models in new ways.",

Zebrafish stxbp1b mutants provide an efficient preclinical platform to test antiseizure therapeutics. The present study was designed to test prototype antiepileptic drugs approved for clinical use and two recently identified repurposed drugs with antiseizure activity.\n\nMethodsLarval homozygous stxbp1b zebrafish (4 days post-fertilization) were agarose-embedded and monitored for electrographic seizure activity using a local field recording electrode placed in midbrain. Frequency of ictal-like events was evaluated at baseline and following 45 min of continuous drug exposure (1 mM, bath application). Analysis was performed on coded files by an experimenter blinded to drug treatment and genotype.\n\nResultsPhenytoin, valproate, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, and diazepam had no effect on ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish. Clemizole and trazodone decreased ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish by 80% and 83%, respectively. These results suggest that repurposed drugs with serotonin receptor binding affinities could be effective antiseizure treatments.\n\nSignificanceClemizole and trazodone were identified in a larval zebrafish model for Dravet syndrome. Based primarily on these preclinical zebrafish studies, compassionate-use and double-blind clinical trials with both drugs have progressed. The present study extends this approach to a preclinical zebrafish model representing STXBP1-related disorders, and suggests that future clinical studies may be warranted.",

Our understanding of the precise role of CRF1-expressing neuronal populations in CRF-mediated behaviors has been largely limited to mouse experiments due to the lack of genetic tools available to selectively visualize and manipulate CRF1+ cells in rats. Here, we describe the generation and validation of a transgenic CRF1:Cre-tdTomato rat, which expresses a bicistronic iCre-2A-tdTomato transgene directed by 200kb of promoter and enhacer sequence surrounding the Crhr1 cDNA present within a BAC clone, that has been transgenically inserted into the rat genome. We report that Crhr1 and Cre mRNA expression are highly colocalized in CRF1:Cre-tdTomato rats within both the central amygdala (CeA), composed of mostly GABAergic neurons, and in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), composed of mostly glutamatergic neurons. In the CeA, membrane properties, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and responses to CRF bath application in tdTomato+ neurons are similar to those previously reported in GFP+ cells in CRFR1-GFP mice. We show that stimulatory DREADD receptors can be selectively targeted to CeA CRF1+ cells via virally delivered Cre-dependent transgenes, that transfected Cre/tdTomato+ cells are activated by clozapine-n-oxide in vitro and in vivo, and that activation of these cells in vivo increases anxiety-like behavior and nocifensive responses. Given the accuracy of expression in the CRF1:Cre rat, modern genetic techniques used to investigate the anatomy, physiology, and behavioral function of CRF1+ neurons and circuits can now be performed in assays that require the use of rats as the model organism.\n\nImpact StatementA novel transgenic rat for studying the role of specific corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptor-expressing cell populations in physiology and behavior.",

Using high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) we addressed this question from a brain network perspective. Specifically, we examined frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting-state networks from twenty-nine young healthy participants before and after they were trained on a motor sequence learning task. Consolidation was assessed with an overnight retest on the motor task. We showed training-related decreases in gamma band connectivity within the motor network, and between the motor and functionally distinct resting-state networks including the attentional network. Brain-behavior correlation analyses revealed that baseline beta, delta and theta rsFC was related to subsequent motor learning and memory consolidation such that lower connectivity within the motor network and between the motor and several distinct resting-state networks was correlated with better learning and overnight consolidation. Last, training-related increases in beta-band connectivity between the motor and the visual networks were related to greater consolidation. Altogether our results indicate that connectivity in large-scale resting-state brain networks is related to - and modulated by - motor learning and memory consolidation processes. These finding corroborate previous seed-based connectivity research and provide evidence that frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting state networks is critically linked to motor learning and memory consolidation.",

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with crucial mutations pose a global challenge in context of therapeutic drugs and vaccines being developed globally. There are currently no specific therapeutics or vaccines available to combat SARS-CoV-2 devastation. In view of this, the current study aimed to identify and characterize the mutations found in the Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian isolates. Non-structural protein, Nsp13 protein sequences from Indian isolates were analyzed by comparing with the first reported Severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence from Wuhan, China. Out of 825 Nsp13 protein sequences, a total of 38 mutations were observed among Indian isolates. Our data show that mutations in Nsp13 at various positions (H164Y, A237T, T214I, C309Y, S236I, P419S, V305E, G54S, H290Y, P53S, A308Y, and A308Y) have a significant impact on the proteins stability and flexibility. Also, the impact of Nsp13 mutations on the protein function were predicted based on PROVEAN score that includes 15 mutants as neutral and 23 mutants as deleterious effect. Furthermore, B-cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13 were identified using various predictive immunoinformatic tools. Immunological Parameters of Nsp13 such as antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity were evaluated to predict the potential B-cell epitopes. The predicted peptide sequences were correlated with the observed mutants. Our predicted data showed that there are seven high rank linear epitopes as well as 18 discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on immunoinformatic tools. Moreover, it was observed that out of total 38 identified mutations among Indian SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 protein, four mutant residues at position 142 (E142), 245 (H245), 247 (V247) and 419 (P419) are localised in the predicted B cell epitopic region. Altogether, the results of the present in-silico study might help to understand the impact of the identified mutations in Nsp13 protein on its stability, flexibility and function.",

In such a case, the results lead to a misinterpretation.\n\nMethodsTo overcome this, we propose a novel approach to estimate a sparse low-rank correlation matrix based on threshold values. We introduce a new cross-validation function to tune the corresponding threshold values. To calculate the value of a function, the MM algorithm is used to estimate the sparse low-rank correlation matrix, and a grid search was performed to select the threshold values.\n\nResultsThrough numerical simulation, we found that the false positive rate (FPR) and average relative error of the proposed method were superior to those of the tandem approach. For the application of microarray gene expression, the FPRs of the proposed approach with d = 2, 3, and 5 were 0.128, 0.139, and 0.197, respectively, whereas the FPR of the tandem approach was 0.285.\n\nConclusionsWe propose a novel approach to estimate sparse low-rank correlation matrices. The advantage of the proposed method is that it provides results that are interpretable through the use of a heatmap, thereby avoiding result misinterpretations.

    "preprint_abstract": "Genetic association studies of child health outcomes often employ family-based designs. One of the most popular family-based designs is the case-parent trio design that considers the smallest possible nuclear family consisting of two parents and their affected child. This trio design is particularly advantageous for studying relatively rare disorders because it is less prone to type 1 error inflation due to population stratification compared to population-based study designs (e.g., case-control studies). However, obtaining genetic data from both parents is difficult, from a practical perspective, and many large studies predominantly measure genetic variants in mother-child dyads. While some statistical methods for analyzing parent-child dyad data (most commonly involving mother-child pairs) exist, it is not clear if they provide the same advantage as trio methods in protecting against population stratification, or if a specific dyad design (e.g., case-mother dyads vs. case-mother/control-mother dyads) is more advantageous. In this article, we review existing statistical methods for analyzing genome-wide data on dyads and perform extensive simulation experiments to benchmark their type I errors and statistical power under different scenarios. We extend our evaluation to existing methods for analyzing a combination of case-parent trios and dyads together. We apply these methods on genotyped and imputed data from multi-ethnic mother-child pairs only, case-parent trios only or combinations of both dyads and trios from the Gene, Environment Association Studies consortium (GENEVA), where each family was ascertained through a child affected by nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Results from the GENEVA study corroborate the findings from our simulation experiments. Finally, we provide recommendations for using statistical genetic association methods for dyads.",

Interestingly, earlier cytometric measurements reported genome sizes of 939 and 567 Mbps in L. salmonis salmonis samples from Bay of Fundy and Norway, respectively.

Thus, saliva may be a biological factor that contributes to the prevention of influenza infection. However, the actual salivary anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity in individuals and its determinant factors are unknown. By assessing individual variations in salivary anti-IAV activity in 92 people using an established new high-throughput system in this study, we found that the anti-IAV activity varied widely between individuals and showed a significant positive correlation with protein-bound sialic acid (BSA) level ({rho}=0.473; p < 0.001). Furthermore, the anti-IAV activity of saliva with enzymatically reduced BSA content was significantly lower. These results indicate that BSA is a direct regulator of salivary anti-IAV activity and is a determinant of individual differences. Additionally, after comparing the anti-IAV activity across the groups by age, anti-IAV activity in young people (aged 5-19 years) were lower than in adults aged 20-59 years and elderly people aged 60-79 years. Our study suggests that BSA levels in saliva may be important in preventing influenza infection.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The control of the aggregation of biomedical nanoparticles (NP) in physiological conditions is crucial as clustering may change completely the way they interact with the biological environment. Here we show that Au nanoparticles, functionalized by an anionic, amphiphilic shell, spontaneously aggregate in fluid zwitterionic lipid bilayers. We use Molecular Dynamics and enhanced sampling techniques to disentangle the short-range and long-range driving forces of aggregation. At short inter-particle distances, ion-mediated, charge-charge interactions (ion bridging) stabilize the formation of large NP aggregates, as confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy. Lipid depletion and membrane curvature are the main membrane deformations driving long-range NP-NP attraction. Ion bridging, lipid depletion, and membrane curvature stem from the configurational flexibility of the nanoparticle shell. Our simulations show, more in general, that the aggregation of same-charge membrane inclusions can be expected as a result of intrinsically nanoscale effects taking place at the NP-NP and NP-bilayer soft interfaces.",

Here we present a new data imputation method using constrained least squares and algorithms from the inverse problems literature and present applications for this technique in miRNA expression analysis.

However, existing whole range phylogeographic studies on lions either consist of very limited numbers of samples, or are focused on mitochondrial DNA and/or a limited set of microsatellites. The geographic extent of genetic lineages and their phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain, clouded by massive sampling gaps, sex-biased dispersal and incomplete lineage sorting.\n\nResultsIn this study we present results of low depth whole genome sequencing and subsequent variant calling in ten lions sampled throughout the geographic range, resulting in the discovery of >150,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Phylogenetic analyses revealed the same basal split between northern and southern populations as well as four population clusters on a more local scale. Further, we designed a SNP panel, including 125 autosomal and 14 mitochondrial SNPs, which was tested on >200 lions from across their range. Results allow us to assign individuals to one of these four major clades (West & Central Africa, India, East Africa, or Southern Africa) and delineate these clades in more detail.\n\nConclusionsThe results presented here, particularly the validated SNP panel, have important applications, not only for studying populations on a local geographic scale, but also for tracing samples of unknown origin for forensic purposes, and for guiding conservation management of ex situ populations. Thus, these genomic resources not only contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the lion, but may also play a crucial role in conservation efforts aimed at protecting the species in its full diversity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "One important approach to human brain mapping is to define a set of distinct regions that can be linked to unique functions. Numerous brain parcellations have been proposed, using cytoarchitectonic, structural or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The intrinsic smoothness of brain data, however, poses a problem for current methods seeking to compare different parcellations. For example, criteria that simply compare within-parcel to between-parcel similarity provide even random parcellations with a high value. Furthermore, the evaluation is biased by the spatial scale of the parcellation. To address this problem, we propose the Distance Controlled Boundary Coefficient (DCBC), an unbiased criterion to evaluate discrete parcellations. We employ this new criterion to evaluate existing parcellations of the human neocortex in their power to predict functional boundaries for an fMRI data set with many different tasks, as well as for resting-state data. We find that common anatomical parcellations do not perform better than chance, suggesting that task-based functional boundaries do not align well with sulcal landmarks. Parcellations based on resting-state fMRI data perform well; in some cases, as well as a parcellation defined on the evaluation data itself. Finally, multi-modal parcellations that combine functional and anatomical criteria perform substantially worse than those based on functional data alone, indicating that functionally homogeneous regions often span major anatomical landmarks. Overall, the DCBC advances the field of functional brain mapping by providing an unbiased metric that compares the predictive ability of different brain parcellations to define brain regions that are functionally maximally distinct.",

Hippo-YAP signaling has been shown to play key roles both at the early embryonic stages of implantation and gastrulation, and later during neurogenesis. To explore YAPs potential role in neurulation, we used self-organizing neuruloids grown from human embryonic stem cells on micropatterned substrates. We identified YAP activation as a key lineage determinant, first between neuronal ectoderm and non-neuronal ectoderm, and later between epidermis and neural crest, indicating that YAP activity can enhance the effect of BMP4 stimulation and therefore affect ectodermal specification at this developmental stage. Because aberrant Hippo-YAP signaling has been implicated in the pathology of Huntingtons Disease (HD), we used isogenic mutant neuruloids to explore the relationship between signaling and the disease. We found that HD neuruloids demonstrate ectopic activation of gene targets of YAP and that pharmacological reduction of YAPs transcriptional activity can partially rescue the HD phenotype.",

By debranching ubiquitin chains composed of K48 linkages, the proteasome-associated ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL5/UCH37 serves as a positive regulator of protein degradation. How UCH37 achieves specificity for K48 chains is unclear. Here, we use a combination of hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry, chemical crosslinking, small-angle X-ray scattering, NMR, molecular docking, and targeted mutagenesis to uncover a cryptic K48 ubiquitin chain specific binding site on the opposite face of UCH37 relative to the canonical S1 ubiquitin-binding site. Biochemical assays demonstrate the K48 chain-specific binding site is required for chain debranching and proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins modified with branched chains. Using quantitative proteomics, translation shutoff experiments, and linkage-specific affinity tools, we then identify specific proteins whose degradation depends on the debranching activity of UCH37. Our findings suggest that UCH37 and potentially other DUBs could use more than one S1 site to perform different biochemical functions.",

While accumulating evidences have shown the importance of the reward system in encoding specific aspects of social interaction, the consequences of social isolation on the reward system and the development of social skills later in adulthood are still largely unknown. Here, we found that one week of social isolation during adolescence in mice increased social interaction at the expense of social habituation and social novelty preference. Behavioural changes were accompanied by the acute hyperexcitability of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral segmental area (VTA) and long-lasting expression of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at excitatory inputs onto DA neurons that project to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Social isolation-dependent behavioural deficits and changes in neural activity and synaptic plasticity were reversed by chemogenetic inhibition of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that social isolation has acute and long-lasting effects on social interaction and suggest that these effects are mediated by homeostatic adaptations within the reward circuit.",

Although high-throughput sequencing has linked gene defects to more than 50% of rare and severe sperm anomalies, less than 20% of common and moderate forms are explained. We hypothesized that this low success rate could at least be partly due to oligogenic defects - the accumulation of several rare heterozygous variants in distinct, but functionally connected, genes. Here, we compared fertility and sperm parameters in male mice harboring one to four heterozygous truncating mutations of genes linked to multiple morphological anomalies of the flagellum (MMAF) syndrome. Results indicated progressively deteriorating sperm morphology and motility with increasing numbers of heterozygous mutations. This first evidence of oligogenic inheritance in failed spermatogenesis strongly suggests that oligogenic heterozygosity could explain a significant proportion of asthenoteratozoospermia cases.

The models suggest these events were nearly all allopolyploidies, with two distinct progenitors contributing to the modern species. We show that many of the events show a relative rate of duplicate gene loss prior to the first post-polyploidy speciation that is significantly higher than in later phases of their evolution. The relatively low selective constraint seen for the single-copy genes these losses produced lead us to suggest that most of the purely selectively neutral duplicate gene losses occur in the immediate post-polyploid period. We also find ongoing and extensive reciprocal gene losses (RGL; alternative losses of duplicated ancestral genes) between these genomes. With the exception of a handful of closely related taxa, all of these polyploid organisms are separated from each other by tens to thousands of reciprocal gene losses. As a result, it is very unlikely that viable diploid hybrid species could form between these taxa, since matings between such hybrids would tend to produce offspring lacking essential genes. It is therefore possible that the relatively high frequency of recurrent polyploidies in some lineages may be due to the ability of new polyploidies to bypass RGL barriers.",

The budding yeast, an otherwise intron-poor species, preserves two sets of ribosomal protein (RP) genes differing primarily in their introns2-4. Despite recent findings on the role of RP introns under stress and starvation5-7, understanding the contribution of introns to ribosome regulation remains challenging. Here, combining isogrowth profiling8 with single-cell protein measurements9, we found that introns can mediate inducible phenotypic heterogeneity conferring a clear fitness advantage. Osmotic stress leads to bimodal expression of the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps22B, mediated by an intron in the 5 untranslated region of its transcript. The two resulting yeast subpopulations differ in their ability to cope with starvation. Low Rps22B protein levels resulted in prolonged survival under sustained starvation, while high Rps22B levels enabled cells to grow faster after transient starvation. Further, yeast growing at high sugar concentrations - similar to those in ripe grapes - exhibit bimodal Rps22B expression when approaching stationary phase. Differential intron-mediated regulation of RP genes thus provides a way to diversify the population when starvation looms in natural environments. Our findings reveal a new role for introns in inducing phenotypic heterogeneity in changing environments and suggest that duplicated RP genes in yeast contribute to resolving the evolutionary conflict between precise expression control and environmental responsiveness10.",

Here, we report that increasing CCNE1 dosage engenders a vulnerability to the inhibition of the PKMYT1 kinase, a negative regulator of CDK1. To inhibit PKMYT1, we developed RP-6306, an orally bioavailable and selective inhibitor that shows single-agent activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with gemcitabine in models of CCNE1-amplification. RP-6306 treatment causes unscheduled activation of CDK1 selectively in CCNE1 overexpressing-cells, promoting early mitosis in cells undergoing DNA synthesis. CCNE1 overexpression disrupts CDK1 homeostasis at least in part through an early activation of the FOXM1/MYBL2/MuvB-dependent mitotic transcriptional program.

These agents have shown promise in preclinical tumor models and clinical trials. FDA has recently granted approval to sotorasib for KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patients receiving these agents as monotherapy may not respond and generally develop drug resistance over time. This necessitates the development of multi-targeted approaches that can potentially sensitize tumors to KRAS inhibitors. We generated KRAS G12C inhibitor-resistant cell lines and observed that they exhibit sensitivity toward selinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear export protein exportin1 (XPO1), as a single agent. KRAS G12C inhibitor MRTX1257 in combination with selinexor suppressed the proliferation of KRAS G12C mutant cancer cell lines MiaPaCa-2 and NCI-H2122 in a synergistic manner. Moreover, combined treatment of selinexor with KRAS G12C inhibitors resulted in enhanced spheroid disintegration, reduction in the number and size of colonies formed by G12C mutant cancer cells. A combination of selinexor with KRAS G12C inhibitors potentiated the inhibition of KRAS expression in MiaPaCa-2 cells. NF-kB protein expression was also markedly reduced by selinexor and MRTX1257 combination. In an in vivo KRAS G12C cell-derived xenograft model, oral administration of a combination of selinexor and sotorasib was demonstrated to reduce tumor burden and enhance survival. In conclusion, we have shown that the nuclear transport protein XPO1 inhibitor can enhance the anticancer activity of KRAS G12C inhibitors in preclinical cancer models.\n\nSignificanceIn this study, combining nuclear transport inhibitor selinexor with KRAS G12C inhibitors has resulted in potent antitumor effects in preclinical cancer models. This can be an effective combination therapy for cancer patients that do not respond or develop resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment.",

Intuition suggests that stable social environments favour developing few but strong reciprocal relationships (a  focused strategy), while volatile social environments favour the opposite: more but weaker social relationships (a  diversifying strategy). We model reciprocal investments under a quality-quantity tradeoff for social relationships. We find that volatility, counterintuitively, can favour a focused strategy. This result becomes explicable through applying the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy, originally developed for senescence, to social life. Diversifying strategies show superior performance later in life, but with costs paid at young ages while the social network is slowly being built. Under volatile environments, many individuals die before reaching sufficiently old ages to reap the benefits. Social strategies that do well early in life are then favoured: a focused strategy leads individuals to form their first few social bonds quickly and to make strong use of existing bonds. Our model highlights the importance of pleiotropy and population age structure for the evolution of cooperative strategies and other social traits, and shows that it is not sufficient to reflect on the fate of survivors only, when evaluating the benefits of social strategies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In some vertebrate species, gene-environment interactions can determine sex, driving bipotential gonads to differentiate into either ovaries or testes. In the central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), the genetic influence of sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW) can be overridden by high incubation temperatures, causing ZZ male to female sex reversal. Previous research showed ovotestes, a rare gonadal phenotype with traits of both sexes, develop during sex reversal, leading to the hypothesis that sex reversal relies on high temperature feminisation to outcompete the male genetic cue. To test this, we conducted temperature switching experiments at key developmental stages, and analysed the effect on gonadal phenotypes using histology and transcriptomics. We found sexual fate is more strongly influenced by the ZZ genotype than temperature. Any exposure to low temperatures (28{degrees}C) caused testes differentiation, whereas sex reversal required longer exposure to high temperatures. We revealed ovotestes exist along a spectrum of female-ness to male-ness at the transcriptional level. We found inter-individual variation in gene expression changes following temperature switches, suggesting both genetic sensitivity to, and the timing and duration of the temperature cue influences sex reversal. These findings bring new insights to the mechanisms underlying sex reversal, improving our understanding of thermosensitive sex systems in vertebrates.",

However, it could potentially play a role in potentiating anti-tumor immunity in the immunologically \"cold\" metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by inducing antigen presentation pathways and concurrently providing targets for immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Moreover, it could additionally increase sensitivity to chemotherapy based on its pleiotropic effects on cell phenotype. Here, we show that IFN{gamma} treatment induced expression of major histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I) genes and PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, IFN{gamma} treatment led to a decrease in E-cadherin expression with a consequent increase in sensitivity to chemotherapy in vitro. In an in vivo murine tumor model of spontaneous metastatic prostate cancer, IFN{gamma} systemic pretreatment upregulated the expression of HLA-A and decreased E-cadherin expression in the primary tumor, and more importantly in the metastatic site led to increased apoptosis and limited micrometastases in combination with paclitaxel treatment compared to diffuse metastatic disease in control and monotherapy treatment groups. These findings suggest that IFN{gamma} may be useful in combinatorial regimens to induce sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy in hepatic metastases of mCRPC.",

Previous research has shown that participants may underweight information incompatible with previous choices, a phenomenon called confirmation bias. In this paper we argue that a similar bias exists in the way information is actively sought. We investigate how choice influences information gathering using a perceptual choice task and find that participants sample more information from a previously chosen alternative. Furthermore, the higher the confidence in the initial choice, the more biased information sampling becomes. As a consequence, when faced with the possibility of revising an earlier decision, participants are more likely to stick with their original choice, even when incorrect. Critically, we show that agency controls this phenomenon. The effect disappears in a fixed sampling condition where presentation of evidence is controlled by the experimenter, suggesting that the way in which confirmatory evidence is acquired critically impacts the decision process. These results suggest active information acquisition plays a critical role in the propagation of strongly held beliefs over time.",

Some of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. Comparison of genes between BALF and Cipa showed an enrichment of biological processes like transcription regulation and response to lipids, to be downregulated in Cipa while being upregulated in COVID-19.

Activation of these channels silence the neurons, limiting action potential duration and preventing high-frequency action potential burst. Mutation of the KCNQ genes are associated with a wide spectrum of phenotypes characterized by hyperexcitability. Activation of KCNQ channels is an attractive strategy to treat epilepsy and other hyperexcitability conditions as are the evolution of stroke and traumatic brain injury. In this work we show that triclosan, a bactericide widely used in personal care products, activates the KCNQ3 channels but not the KCNQ2. Triclosan induces a voltage shift in the activation, increases the conductance and slows the closing of the channel. The effect is independent of PIP2. The putative binding site is located in the pore region but is distinct from the binding site for retigabine. Our results indicate that triclosan is a new activator for KCNQ channels.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Fitness is at the core of evolutionary theory, but it is difficult to measure accurately. One way to measure long-term fitness is by calculating the individuals reproductive value, which represents the expected number of allele copies an individual passes on to distant future generations. However, this metric of fitness is scarcely used because the estimation of individuals reproductive value requires long-term pedigree data, which is rarely available in wild populations where following individuals from birth to death is often impossible. Wild study systems therefore use short-term fitness metrics as proxies, such as the number of offspring produced. This study obtained three frequently used short-term proxies for fitness obtained at different offspring life stages (eggs, hatchlings, fledglings and recruits), and compared their ability to predict reproductive values derived from the genetic pedigree of a wild passerine bird population. We used twenty years of precise field observations and a near-complete genetic pedigree to calculate reproductive success, individual growth rate and de-lifed fitness as lifetime fitness measures, and as annual de-lifed fitness. We compared the power of these metrics to predict reproductive values and lineage survival to the end of the study period. The three short-term fitness proxies predict the reproductive values and lineage survival only when measured at the recruit stage. There were no significant differences between the different fitness proxies at the same offspring stages in predicting the reproductive values and lineage survival. Annual fitness at one year old predicted reproductive values equally well as lifetime de-lifed fitness. However, none of the short-term fitness proxies was strongly associated with the reproductive values. In summary, the commonly short-term fitness proxies capture long-term fitness with intermediate accuracy at best, if measured at recruitment stage. As lifetime fitness measured at recruit stage and annual fitness in the first year of life were the best proxies of long-term fitness, we encourage their future use.",

    "preprint_abstract": "TLR7 and TLR8 are key members of the Toll-like receptor family, playing crucial roles in the signaling pathways of innate immunity, and thus become attractive therapeutic targets of many diseases including infections and cancer. Although TLR7 and TLR8 show a highly degree of sequence homology, their biological response to small molecule binding is very different. Aiming to understand the mechanism of selective profiles of small molecule modulators against TLR7 and TLR8, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations on three imidazoquinoline derivatives bound to the receptors separately. They are Resiquimod (R), Hybrid-2 (H), and Gardiquimod (G), selective agonists of TLR7 and TLR8. Our MD trajectories indicated that in the complex of TLR7-R and TLR7-G, the two chains forming the TLR7 dimer tended to remain \"open\" conformation, while the rest systems maintained in the closed format. The agonists R, H, and G developed conformational deviation mainly on the aliphatic tail. Furthermore, we attempted to quantify the selectivity between TLR7 and TLR8 by binding free energies via MM-GBSA method. It showed that the three selected modulators were more favorable for TLR7 than TLR8, and the ranking from the strongest to the weakest was H, R and G, aligning well with experiment data. In the TLR7, the flexible and hydrophobic aliphatic side chain of H has stronger van der Waals interactions with Val381 and Phe351 but only pick up interaction with one amino acid residue i.e. Tyr353 of TLR8. Unsurprisingly, the positively charged side chain of G has less favor interaction with Ile585 of TLR7 and Val573 of TLR8 explaining G is weak agonist in both TLR7 and TLR8. All three imidazoquinolines can form stable hydrogen bonds with Asp555 of TLR7 and the corresponding Asp543 of TLR8. In brief, the set of total 400ns MD studies sheds light on the potential selective mechanisms of agonists towards TLR7 and TLR8, indicating the van der Waals interaction as the driving force for the agonists binding, thus provides us insights for more potent and selective modulators to cooperate with the hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket.",

In fission yeast, stimulation of Mus81-Eme1 in response to DNA damage at the G2/M transition relies on Cdc2CDK1 and DNA damage checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Eme1 and is critical for chromosome stability in absence of the Rqh1BLM helicase. Here we identify Rad3ATR checkpoint kinase consensus phosphorylation sites and two SUMO interacting motifs (SIM) within a short N-terminal domain of Eme1 that is required for cell survival in absence of Rqh1BLM. We show that catalytic stimulation of Mus81-Eme1 depends entirely on direct phosphorylation of Eme1 by Rad3ATR and that while Eme1 also undergoes Chk1-mediated phosphorylation, this is not essential for catalytic modulation. Both Rad3ATR- and Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of Eme1 as well as the SIMs are independently critical for cell fitness in absence of Rqh1BLM and abrogating bimodal phosphorylation of Eme1 along with mutating the SIMs is incompatible with rqh1{Delta} cell viability.

This view was challenged by evidence of contextual interactions between stimulus dimensions in which a neurons response to one dimension strongly depends on other dimensions. Here we use methods of mathematical modeling, psychophysics, and electrophysiology to address shortcomings of the traditional view. Using a model of a generic cortical circuit, we begin with the simple demonstration that cortical responses are always distributed among neurons, forming characteristic waveforms, which we call neural waves. When stimulated by patterned stimuli, circuit responses arise by interference of neural waves. Resulting patterns of interference depend on interaction between stimulus dimensions. Comparison of these modeled responses with responses of biological vision makes it clear that the framework of neural wave interference provides a useful alternative to the standard concept of neural computation.\n\nTeaserInvestigating interference of neural waves helps to overcome limitations of the traditional view of cortical computation.",

Electrophysiological studies in monkeys show that finger amputation triggers increased selectivity to the neighbouring fingers within the deprived S1, causing local reorganisation. Neuroimaging research in humans, however, shows persistent S1 finger representation of the missing hand, even decades after amputation. We aimed to resolve these apparently contrasting evidence by examining finger representation in humans following pharmacological  amputation using single-finger nerve block and 7T neuroimaging. We hypothesised that beneath the apparent selectivity of individual fingers in the hand map, peripheral and central processing is distributed across fingers. If each finger contributes to the cortical representation of the others, then localised input loss will weaken finger representation across the hand map. For the same reason, the non-blocked fingers will stabilise the blocked fingers representation, resulting in persistent representation of the blocked finger. Using univariate selectivity profiling, we replicated the electrophysiological findings of local S1 reorganisation. However, more comprehensive analyses confirmed that local blocking reduced representation of all fingers across the entire hand area. Importantly, multivariate analysis demonstrated that despite input loss, representation of the blocked finger remained persistent and distinct from the unblocked fingers. Computational modelling suggested that the observed findings are driven by distributed processing underlying the topographic map, combined with homeostatic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the long-standing depiction of the somatosensory hand map is misleading. As such, accounts for map reorganisation, e.g. following amputation, need to be reconsidered.",

Several relevant cellular responses such as the rhythmic compression of the cell cortex are governed, at a mesoscopic level, by the nonlinear interaction between actin monomers, actin crosslinkers and myosin motors. Coarse grained models are an optimal tool to study actomyosin systems, since they can include processes that occur at long time and space scales, while maintaining the most relevant features of the molecular interactions. Here, we present a coarse grained model of a two-dimensional actomyosin cortex, adjacent to a three-dimensional cytoplasm. Our simplified model incorporates only well characterized interactions between actin monomers, actin crosslinkers and myosin, and it is able to reproduce many of the most important aspects of actin filament and actomyosin network formation, such as dynamics of polymerization and depolymerization, treadmilling, network formation and the autonomous oscillatory dynamics of actomyosin. Furthermore, the model can be used to predict the in vivo response of actomyosin networks to changes in key parameters of the system, such as alterations in the anchor of actin filaments to the cell cortex.",

However, to what extent such decisions differ from those with a single source remains unclear. Here, we combined cognitive modelling and neural-mass modelling to characterise the neurocognitive process underlying decisionmaking with single or double information sources. Ninety-four human participants performed binary decisions to discriminate the coherent motion direction averaged across two independent apertures. Regardless the angular distance of the apertures, separating motion information into two apertures resulted in a reduction in accuracy. Our modelling results further showed that the addition of the second information source led to a lower signal-to-noise ratio of evidence accumulation with two congruent information sources, and a change in the decision strategy of speed-accuracy trade-off with two incongruent sources. Thus, our findings support a robust behavioural change in relation to multiple information sources, which have congruency-dependent impacts on selective decision-making subcomponents.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Inspired by the geometric properties of seal whiskers, the addition of spanwise undulations on a cylinder have been shown to lower the mean and oscillatory forces and modify the frequency of flow-induced vibration when compared to smooth cylinders. Previously, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to characterize the hydrodynamic response with respect to specific geometric features. However simulations are time intensive due to complex three-dimensional meshing and computation time, limiting the number of geometric perturbations explored. A method is proposed in which the specific geometric features of this complex topography can be modified during a simulation thereby decreasing the time per geometric modification and removing the need for manual meshing of the complex structure. The surface of the seal whisker inspired geometry is parameterized into seven defining parameters, each of which is directly controlled in order to morph the surface into any realization within the defined parameter space. Once validated, the algorithm is used to explore the undulation amplitudes in the chord and thickness directions, by varying each independently from 0 to 0.3 thicknesses in increments of 0.05 at a Reynolds number of 500. The force and frequency response are examined for this matrix of geometric parameters, yielding detailed force trends not previously investigated. The impact of the bio-inspired morphing algorithm will allow for further optimization and development of force-mitigating underwater devices and other engineering applications in need of vibration suppression, frequency tuning, or force reduction.",

Despite their central importance, it has been difficult to quantitatively measure these quantities from single cells in intact tissue. Here, we introduce Normalized Raman Imaging (NoRI), a Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscopy method that provides the local concentrations of protein, lipid and water from live or fixed tissue samples with high spatial resolution. Using NoRI, we demonstrate that single cell protein, lipid and water concentrations are maintained in a tight range in cells under same physiological conditions and are altered in different physiological states such as cell cycle stages, attachment to substrates of different stiffness, or by entering senescence. In animal tissues, protein and lipid concentration varies with cell types, yet an unexpected cell-to-cell heterogeneity was found in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Protein and lipid concentration profile provides a new means to quantitatively compare disease-related pathology as demonstrated using models of Alzheimers disease. Our demonstration shows that NoRI is a broadly applicable tool for probing the biological regulation of protein mass, lipid mass and water in cellular and tissue growth, homeostasis, and disease.",

MPAs are generally established as permanent closures but marine systems are dynamic, which has generated debate in favour of more dynamic designs. As a consequence, the identification of priority areas should assess their persistence in space and time. Here, we develop a step-by-step approach to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of fisheries management priority areas using standard fishery-independent survey data. To do so, we fit Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal SDM models to different commercially important demersal species and use the resulting maps to fit different spatial prioritisation configurations. We use these results to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of fisheries priority areas. The proposed method is illustrated through a western Mediterranean case study using fishery-independent trawl survey data on six commercially important species collected over 17 years. We identified two fisheries priority area patterns in the study area, each predominant during a different time-period of the study, asserting the importance of regularly re-assessing MPA designs.",

Several computational methods to estimate RNA processing and degradation rates from such experiments have been suggested, but they all require several RNA sequencing samples. Here we present a method that can estimate RNA synthesis, processing and degradation rates from a single sample. Our method is computationally efficient and outputs rates that correlate well with previously published data sets. Using it on a single sample, we were able to reproduce the observation that dynamic biological processes tend to involve genes with higher metabolic rates, while stable processes involve genes with lower rates. This supports the hypothesis that cells control not only the mRNA steady-state abundance, but also its responsiveness, i.e., how fast steady-state is reached. In addition to saving experimental work and computational time, having a sample-based rate estimation has several advantages. It does not require an error-prone normalization across samples and enables the use of replicates to estimate uncertainty and perform quality control. Finally the method and theoretical results described here are general enough to be useful in other contexts such as nucleotide conversion methods and single cell metabolic labeling experiments.",

The receptor properties are strongly determined by its subunit composition. One of the NMDAR subunits is GluN2B, which displays restricted and spatially different from other subunits expression in the mature brain. GluN2B-containing NMDARs are present in the hippocampus - a structure playing a major role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, the contribution of GluN2B to pathophysiology of TLE has not been fully explored. Here, we report the functional alterations of GluN2B-containing NMDAR receptors in the hippocampus in distinct mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy. In particular, we show the impact of GluN2B on excitatory feedback in granule cells. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism-oriented effective antiepileptic strategy that selectively antagonizes GluN2B-containing NMDARs with ifenprodil, a well-known GluN2B antagonist. Collectively, our research identifies GluN2B as one of the pivotal factors in pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy and associated recurrent seizures. Furthermore, our study indicates the prospective antiepileptic properties of ifenprodil in TLE.",

Identifying molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation in response to chronic physical activity is of critical interest in metabolic physiology. Circadian rhythms broadly modulate metabolism, including muscle substrate utilization and exercise capacity. Here, we define the molecular and physiological changes induced across the daily cycle by voluntary low intensity daily exercise.\n\nMethodsWildtype c57BL6/J male and female mice were housed with or without access to a running wheel for six weeks. Maximum running speed was measured at four different zeitgeber times (ZTs, hours after lights on) using either electrical or manual stimulation to motivate continued running on a motorized treadmill. RNA isolated from plantaris muscles at six ZTs was sequenced to establish the impact of daily activity on genome-wide transcription. Patterns of gene expression were analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Detection of Differential Rhythmicity (DODR). Blood glucose, lactate, and ketones, and muscle and liver glycogen were measured before and after exercise.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that the use of mild electrical shocks to motivate running negatively impacts maximum running speed and describe a manual method to motivate running in rodent exercise studies. Using this method, we show that time of day influences the increase in exercise capacity afforded by six weeks of voluntary wheel running: when maximum running speed is measured at the beginning of the nighttime active period in mice, there is no measurable benefit from a history of daily voluntary running, while maximum increase in performance occurs at the end of the night. We show that daily voluntary exercise dramatically remodels the muscle circadian transcriptome. Finally, we describe daily rhythms in carbohydrate metabolism associated with the timedependent response to moderate daily exercise.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, these data indicate that chronic nighttime physical activity dramatically remodels daily rhythms of muscle gene expression, which in turn support daily fluctuations in exercise performance.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Two-thirds of adults in the United Kingdom currently suffer from overweight or obesity, making it one of the biggest contributors to health problems. Within the framework of the incentive sensitisation theory, it has been hypothesised that overweight people experience heightened reward anticipation when encountering cues that signal food, such as pictures and smells of food, but that they experience less reward from consuming food compared to normal-weight people. There is, however, little evidence for this prediction. Few studies test both anticipation and consumption in the same study, and even fewer with electroencephalography (EEG). This study sought to address this gap in the literature by measuring scalp activity when overweight and normal-weight people encountered cues signalling the imminent arrival of pleasant and neutral taste stimuli, and when they received these stimuli. The behavioural data showed that there was a smaller difference in valence ratings between the pleasant and neutral taste in the overweight than normal-weight group, in accordance with our hypothesis. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the groups did not differ in their electrophysiological response to taste stimuli. Instead, there was a reduction in N1 amplitude to both taste and picture cues in overweight relative to normal-weight participants. This suggests that reduced attention to cues may be a crucial factor in risk of overweight.",

The accumulation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) in the brain has historically been associated with AD, and recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a central role in its origin and progression. These observations have given rise to the theory that A{beta} is the primary trigger of AD, and induces proinflammatory activation of immune brain cells (i.e. microglia), which culminates in neuronal damage and cognitive decline. In order to test this hypothesis, many in vitro systems have been established to study A{beta}-mediated activation of innate immune cells. Nevertheless, the transcriptional resemblance of these models to the microglia in the AD brain has never been comprehensively studied on a genome-wide scale. To address this, we used bulk RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional differences between in vitro cell types used to model neuroinflammation in AD, including several established, primary and iPSC-derived immune cell lines (macrophages, microglia and astrocytes) and their similarities to primary cells in the AD brain. We then analyzed the transcriptional response of these innate immune cells to synthetic A{beta}. We found that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived microglia (IMGL) are the in vitro cell model that best resembles primary microglia. Surprisingly, synthetic A{beta} does not trigger a robust transcriptional response in any of the cellular models analyzed, despite testing a wide variety of A{beta} formulations, concentrations, and treatment conditions. Finally, we found that bacterial LPS and INF{gamma} activate microglia and induce transcriptional changes similar to those observed in disease associated microglia present in the AD brain, suggesting the potential suitability of this model to study AD-related neuroinflammation.",

Instead, we argue that greater focus is needed on investigating the transient (i.e. short-term) dynamics of coral populations to describe and predict their characteristics and trajectories within unstable environments.

Although it has been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes, the precise role of the PAF1C during germ line development has not been clarified. In this study, we found that reduction in the function of the PAF1C components, LEO-1, RTFO-1, PAFO-1, CDC-73, and CTR-9, in Caenorhabditis elegans affects cell volume expansion of oocytes. Defects in oogenesis were also confirmed using an oocyte maturation marker, OMA-1::GFP. While four to five OMA-1::GFP-positive oocytes were observed in wild-type animals, their numbers were significantly decreased in pafo-1 mutant and leo-1(RNAi), cdc-73(RNAi), and pafo-1(RNAi) animals. Expression of a functional PAFO-1::mCherry transgene in the germline significantly rescued the oogenesis-defective phenotype of the pafo-1 mutants, suggesting that expression of the PAF1C in germ cells is required for oogenesis. Notably, overexpression of OMA-1::GFP partially rescued the oogenesis defect in the pafo-1 mutants. Based on our findings, we propose that the PAF1C promotes oogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner by positively regulating the expression of genes involved in oocyte maturation.",

PTBP1 has an essential role in regulating the early events following activation of the naive CD8 T cell leading to IL-2 and TNF production. It is also required to protect activated CD8 T cells from apoptosis. PTBP1 controls alternative splicing of over 400 genes in naive CD8 T cells in addition to regulating the abundance of [~]200 mRNAs. PTBP1 is required for the nuclear accumulation of c-Fos, NFATc2 and NFATc3, but not NFATc1. This selective effect on NFAT proteins correlates with PTBP1-promoted expression of the shorter A{beta}1 isoform and exon 13 skipped A{beta}2 isoform of the catalytic A-subunit of calcineurin phosphatase.

Phylodynamic approaches are commonly used for RNA viruses harboring small genomes, but have only rarely been applied to DNA viruses with larger genomes. Here, we used the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS, a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and an innovative combination of bioinformatics tools, we de novo assembled 21 OsHV-1 new genomes. Combining quantification of major and minor genetic variations, phylogenetic analysis and ancestral state reconstruction of discrete traits approaches; we assessed the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes- Oleron Bay represents the main source of OsHV-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France. We demonstrate that phylodynamic approaches can be applied to aquatic DNA viruses to determine how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape their diversity patterns.\n\nImportancePhylogeography is a field of research that attempts to reconstruct the relationships between individual genotypes within a species and then correlate these genealogical relationships with their geographic and temporal origin. This field of research has become an essential step in the understanding of pandemics, in particular to determine the origin, spread and evolution of a pathogen as currently illustrated in studies on viral pandemics. However, because phylogeographic analyses are based on genome variation, stable genomes yield less information than labile genomes. Accordingly, viruses with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes generally have lower nucleotide diversity than RNA viruses. In this study, by combining the use of both major and minor genetic variations with phylogeographic analyses of the oyster herpesvirus OsHV-1, we highlight genealogical relationships that are not depicted in phylogenetic trees based on consensus viral genomes only. These data offer a plausible scenario reflecting the origin and spread of OsHV-1 populations between oyster- farming sites.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Attention has been found to sample visual information periodically, in a wide range of frequencies below 20 Hz. This periodicity may be supported by brain oscillations at corresponding frequencies. We propose that part of the discrepancy in periodic frequencies observed in the literature is due to differences in attentional demands, resulting from heterogeneity in tasks performed. To test this hypothesis, we used visual search and manipulated task complexity, i.e., target discriminability (high, medium, low) and number of distractors (set size), while electro-encephalography was simultaneously recorded. We replicated previous results showing that the phase of pre-stimulus low-frequency oscillations predicts search performance. Crucially, such effects were observed at increasing frequencies within the theta-alpha range (6-18 Hz) for decreasing target discriminability. In medium and low discriminability conditions, correct responses were further associated with higher post-stimulus phase-locking than incorrect ones, in increasing frequency and latency. Finally, the larger the set size, the later the post-stimulus effect peaked. Together, these results suggest that increased complexity (lower discriminability or larger set size) requires more attentional cycles to perform the task, partially explaining discrepancies between reports of attentional sampling. Low-frequency oscillations structure the temporal dynamics of neural activity and aid top-down, attentional control for efficient visual processing.",

There is a need for minimally invasive approaches to improve the accuracy of NSCLC diagnosis. Plasma extracellular vesicle (EV) and circulating microRNA (miRNA) have been proposed as cancer screening biomarkers. However, the identification of highly sensitive and broadly predictive core miRNA signatures remains a challenge. Also, how these systemic and diverse miRNAs impact cancer drug response is not well understood. Using an integrative approach, we examined plasma EV and circulating miRNA isolated from NSCLC patients versus screening controls with a similar risk profile. We found that combining EV (Hsa-miR-184, Let-7b-5p) and circulating (Hsa-miR-22-3p) miRNAs abundance robustly discriminates between NSCLC patients and high-risk cancer-free controls. Diagnosed NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR (T790M, L578R) are treated with Osimertinib, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Nearly all patients develop TKI resistance via complex mechanisms and progress. We found that Hsa-miR-22-3p, Hsa-miR-184, and Let-7b-5p functionally converge on WNT/{beta}catenin and mTOR/AKT signaling axes, known cancer therapy resistance signals. Targeting Hsa-miR-22-3p and Hsa-miR-184 desensitized EGFR-mutated (T790M, L578R) NSCLC cells to Osimertinib. These findings suggest that the expression levels of circulating hsa-miR-22-3p combined with EV hsa-miR-184 and Let-7b-5p levels potentially define a core biomarker signature for improving the accuracy of NSCLC diagnosis. Importantly, these biomarkers have the potential to enable prospective identification of patients who are at risk of responding poorly to Osimertinib alone but likely to benefit from Osimertinib/AKT blockade combination treatments.",

Allelic diversity may be favoured not only through balancing or frequency dependent selection at individual loci, but also by associating different alleles in multi copy gene families. Using a combination of analytical calculations and simulations, we explored a population genetic model of epistatic selection and unequal recombination, where a trade-off exists between the benefit of allelic diversity and the cost of copy abundance. Starting from the neutral case, where we showed that gene copy number is Gamma-distributed at equilibrium, we derived also mean and shape of the limiting distribution under selection. Considering a more general model which includes variable population size and population substructure, we explored by simulations mean fitness and some summary statistics of the copy number distribution. We determined the relative effects of selection, recombination and demographic parameters in maintaining allelic diversity and shaping mean fitness of a population. One way to control the variance of copy number is by lowering the rate of unequal recombination. Indeed, when encoding recombination by a rate modifier locus, we observe exactly this prediction. Finally, we analyzed the empirical copy number distribution of three genes in human and estimated recombination and selection parameters of our model.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The occurrence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Eukarya is increasingly gaining recognition. Nuclear-to-nuclear jump of DNA between plant species at high phylogenetic distance and devoid of intimate association (e.g., parasitism) is still scarcely reported. Within eukaryotes, components of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) multigene family have been found to be horizontally transferred in protists, fungi and grasses. However, in neither case HGT occurred between phylogenetic families, nor the transferred rDNA remained tandemly arrayed and transcriptionally active in the recipient organism. This study aimed to characterize an alien eudicot-type of 45S nuclear rDNA, assumingly transferred horizontally to the genome of monocot European Erythronium (Liliaceae). Genome skimming coupled by PacBio HiFi sequencing of a BAC clone were applied to determine DNA sequence of the alien rDNA. A clear phylogenetic signal traced the origin of the alien rDNA of Erythronium back to the Argentea clade of Potentilla (Rosaceae) and deemed the transfer to have occurred in the common ancestor of E. dens-canis and E. caucasicum. Though being discontinuous, transferred rDNA preserved its general tandemly arrayed feature in the host organism. Southern blotting, molecular cytogenetics, and sequencing of a BAC clone derived from flow-sorted nuclei indicated integration of the alien rDNA into the recipients nuclear genome. Unprecedently, dicot-type alien rDNA was found to be transcribed in the monocot Erythronium albeit much less efficiently than the native counterpart. This study adds a new example to the growing list of naturally transgenic plants while holding the scientific community continually in suspense about the mode of DNA transfer.\n\nSignificance StatementRibosomal DNA is an essential component of all cellular genomes. In plants, accidental movement of rDNA via horizontal gene transfer has only been reported in sexually incompatible grasses (monocots) where it involved non-functional rDNA units. In this study, we propose that evolutionary trajectories of eudicots and monocots were bypassed by the jump of rDNA from a Potentilla species (Rosaceae) to a common ancestor of Erythronium dens-canis and E. caucasicum (Liliaceae). The alien eudicot-type rDNA appeared relatively well conserved in the examined host Erythronium genome, being able to be expressed while preserving its general tandemly repeated feature, evidences that have no match in earlier literature.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The application of demographic history modeling and inference to the study of divergence between species is becoming a cornerstone of speciation genomics. The demographic history is usually reconstructed by analysing a single population from each species, assuming that the divergence history inferred between these populations represents the actual speciation history. However, this assumption is rarely explicitly tested, and it may not be met when species diverge with gene flow. For instance, secondary contact between two species after a range expansion may be confined into a specific geographic region. In this study, we tested to what extent the divergence history inferred from two heterospecific populations would vary depending on their geographic locations, using mound-building red wood ants. The wood ant species Formica polyctena and F. aquilonia have contrasting distributions in Europe and naturally hybridize in Finland. We first performed whole-genome resequencing of 20 individuals sampled in multiple populations across both species ranges. We then reconstructed the divergence histories of distinct heterospecific population pairs using a coalescent-based approach. We found that the analysis of these different population pairs always supported a scenario of divergence with gene flow, suggesting that species divergence started in the Pleistocene (ca. 500 kya) and occurred with continuous asymmetrical gene flow from F. aquilonia to F. polyctena until a recent time, when migration stopped (2-19 kya, depending on the population pair considered). However, we found support for contemporary gene flow in the sympatric population pair from Finland, where hybrids have been described. Overall, our results suggest that divergence histories reconstructed from a few individuals may be reliable and applicable at the species level. Nonetheless, the geographical context of populations chosen to represent their species should be taken into account, as it may affect estimates of migration rates between species when gene flow is heterogeneous across their geographical ranges.",

Although, Crotamine has been shown to be selective for highly proliferating cells and is able to extend the in vivo lifespan. The present study using a cell line of cervical cancer, HeLa cells provide insights into how Crotamine acts in cell metabolism. NMR spectroscopy was used to identify and quantify relative metabolite levels, which are associated with Crotamine uptake. Statistical analysis reveals that Crotamine dramatically affects metabolites related to glycolysis, metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids and pyruvate metabolism. The developed machine learning model is found to be robust by ROC curve analysis, suggesting that the metabolic state of HeLa cells treated with Crotamine is different from the control samples. To account for metabolite levels, it is suggested that Crotamine would have to act on glycolysis, which, in turn, affects several other metabolic pathways, such as, glutathione metabolism, TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism. The observed metabolic changes shed light into the mode of Crotamine function.",

While classical and recent work have shown that studying admixture can yield novel historical insights, the extent to which this process contributed to adaptation remains underexplored. Here, we introduce a novel statistical model, specific to admixed populations, that identifies loci under selection while determining whether the selection likely occurred post-admixture or prior to admixture in one of the ancestral source populations. Through extensive simulations we show that this method is able to detect selection, even in recently formed admixed populations, and to accurately differentiate between selection occurring in the ancestral or admixed population. We apply this method to genome-wide SNP data of ~4,000 individuals in five admixed Latin American cohorts from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Our approach replicates previous reports of selection in the HLA region that are consistent with selection post-admixture. We also report novel signals of selection in genomic regions spanning 47 genes, reinforcing many of these signals with an alternative, commonly-used local-ancestry-inference approach. These signals include several genes involved in immunity, which may reflect responses to endemic pathogens of the Americas and to the challenge of infectious disease brought by European contact. In addition, some of the strongest signals inferred to be under selection in the Native American ancestral groups of modern Latin Americans overlap with genes implicated in energy metabolism phenotypes, plausibly reflecting adaptations to novel dietary sources available in the Americas.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Imitation is a significant daily activity involved in social interaction and motor learning. Imitation has been theorized to be performed in at least two ways. In posture-based imitation, individuals reproduce how the body should look and feel, and are sensitive to the relative positioning of body parts. In trajectory imitation, individuals mimic the spatiotemporal motion path of the end effector. There are clear anecdotal situations in which one might benefit from imitating postures (when learning ballet) or trajectories (when learning to reach around objects). However, whether these are in fact distinct methods of imitation, and if so, whether they may be applied interchangeably to perform the same task, remain unknown. If these are indeed separate mechanisms that rely on different computational and neural resources, a cost should be incurred when switching from using one mechanism to the other within the context of a single task. Therefore observing a processing cost would both provide evidence that these are indeed two distinct mechanisms, and that they may be used interchangeably when trying to imitate the same stimulus. To test this, twenty-five healthy young adults performed a sequential multitasking imitation task. Participants were first instructed to pay attention to the limb postures or the hand path of a video-recorded model, then performed a neutral, congruent, or incongruent intervening motor task. Finally, participants imitated the modeled movement. Spatiotemporal imitation accuracy was greatest after a neutral intervening task, and worst after posture matching. When the primary task involved imitating trajectories, the data suggested a processing cost: movements following the posture-matching intervening task were less consistent with baseline (neutral) performance, suggesting performance may be disrupted by the incongruence. This effect was not observed when imitating limb postures. In summary, we present initial evidence of a partial dissociation between posture matching and trajectory imitation as a result of instructions and intervening tasks that is consistent with the existence of two computationally distinct imitation mechanisms.",

This simultaneously addresses two major impediments to improving algal bioenergy production: 1) generating new genetic variants with improved performance; and 2) disentangling complex interactions between genetic and physiological factors contributing to these improvements. We pooled progeny generated from mating two environmental isolates of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cultured the pools under multiple environmental conditions. Strains from the outcompeting populations showed substantial (in some cases over 3 fold) increases in productivity over the parental lines under certain environments related to biomass production, including laboratory conditions as well as hyperoxia, fluctuating light, high salinity and high temperature. The results indicate that C. reinhardtii has remarkable, untapped, directed evolution capacity that may be harnessed using breeding and competition approaches. The populations were deep sequenced at multiple time points to identify \"Selection-Enriched Genomic Loci\" (SEGL) that accumulated in the populations, and thus likely confer increased fitness under the respective environmental conditions. With improved resolution, SEGL mapping can identify allelic combinations used for targeted breeding approaches, generating elite algal lines with multiple desirable traits, as well as to further understand the genetic and mechanistic bases of photosynthetic productivity.\n\nSignificance StatementIncreasing the photosynthetic efficiency of algae during biomass production is perhaps the most critical hurdle for economically sustainable algal based biofuels. This presents unique challenges because modifications designed to increase photosynthesis often result in decreased fitness, due to production of toxic reactive oxygen species when photosynthesis is not adequately regulated. These problems are exacerbated under natural and outdoor production environments because of the complex nature of photosynthesis and the multifaceted interactions between genetic, environmental and physiological factors. Here, we demonstrate a high throughput biotechnological screening approach that simultaneously produces algal strains with highly increased autotrophic productivity and identifies genomic loci contributing to these improvements. Our results demonstrate that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits high directed evolutionary capacity readily accessed through breeding and selection.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Climate-driven advances in spring can result in phenological mismatch between brood rearing and prey availability and consequently cause decreased productivity in birds. How consequences of mismatch vary across species ranges, and how individual behavior can mitigate mismatch effects is less studied. We quantified the relationship between phenological mismatch, productivity, and behavioral adaptations of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) across their breeding range in the United States and southern Canada. We obtained phenology and productivity data using nest observations from long term nest box monitoring, remote trail cameras, and community-scientist based programs. We collected data on parental incubation behavior and hatch asynchrony using trail cameras in nest boxes. Kestrels that laid eggs after the start of spring had higher rates of nest failure and fewer nestlings than earlier nesters, and effects of mismatch on productivity were most severe in the Northeast. In contrast, kestrels in the Southwest experienced a more gradual decline in productivity with seasonal mismatch. We attribute the effect of location to the growing season and temporal nesting windows (duration of nesting season). Specifically, resource availability in the Northeast is narrow and highly peaked during the breeding season, potentially resulting in shorter nesting windows. Conversely, resource curves may be more prolonged and dampened in the Southwest, and growing seasons are becoming longer with climate change, potentially resulting in longer nesting windows. We found that the onset of male incubation was negatively associated with lay date. Males from breeding pairs that laid eggs after the start of spring began incubation sooner than males from breeding pairs that laid before the start of spring. Early-onset male incubation was positively associated with hatching asynchrony, creating increased age variation in developing young. In sum, we demonstrate that American kestrels are vulnerable to phenological mismatch, and that this vulnerability varies across space. Northeastern populations could be more vulnerable to mismatch consequences, which may be one factor contributing to declines of kestrels in this region. Also, we demonstrate early onset of incubation as a potential adaptive behavior to advance average hatch date and spread out offspring demands, but it is unknown how impactful this will be in mitigating the fitness consequences of phenology mismatch.\n\nHighlightsClimate-driven phenological mismatch is a growing conservation concern.\n\nWe studied phenology and productivity of an avian predator across North America.\n\nAmerican kestrels nesting after the start of spring had lower productivity.\n\nLater nesting kestrels altered incubation to create hatching asynchrony.\n\nMismatch effects were strongest in the Northeast and may contribute to population declines.",

During autumn, N is remobilized from senescing leaves and stored in other parts of the tree to be used in the next growing season. However, the mechanism behind the N fertilization effect on winter survival is not well understood and it is unclear how N levels or forms modulate autumn senescence. We performed fertilization experiments and showed that treating Populus saplings with high or low levels of inorganic nitrogen resulted in a delay in senescence. In addition, by using precise delivery of solutes into the xylem stream of Populus trees in their natural environment, we found that delay of autumn senescence was dependent on the form of N administered: inorganic N (NO3-1) delayed senescence but amino acids (Arg, Glu, Gln, and Leu) did not. Metabolite profiling of leaves showed that the levels of tricarboxylic acids (TCA), arginine catabolites (ammonium, ornithine), glycine, glycine-serine ratio and overall carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio were affected differently by the way of applying NO3-1 and Arg treatments. In addition, the onset of senescence did not coincide with soluble sugar accumulation in any of the treatments. Taken together, metabolomic rearrangement under different N forms or experimental setups could modulate senescence process, but not initiation and progression in Populus. We propose that the different regulation of C and N status through direct molecular signaling of NO3-1 could account for the contrasting effects of NO3-1 and Arg on senescence.\n\nOne sentence summaryNitrate, administered by precision fertilization through injection into the trunk, may delay autumn senescence and change metabolism in Populus leaves, while the same amount of amino acids does not have the same effect.",

    "preprint_abstract": "PurposeNearly 40% of the advanced cancer patients will present brain metastases during the course of their disease, with a 2-year life expectancy of less than 10%. Immune system impairment, including the modulation of both STAT3 and PD-L1, is one of the hallmarks of brain metastases. Liquid biopsy could offer several advantages in brain metastases management, such as the possibility of non-invasive dynamic monitoring. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recently proposed as novel biomarkers especially useful in liquid biopsy due to their secretion in biofluids and their role in cell communication during tumor progression.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe main aim of this work was to characterize the size and protein cargo of plasma circulating EVs in patients with solid tumors and their correlation with newly diagnosed brain metastases, in addition to their association with other relevant clinical variables.\n\nResultsWe analyzed circulating EVs in the plasma of 123 patients: 42 patients with brain metastases, 50 without brain metastases and 31 healthy controls. Patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases had a lower number of circulating EVs in the plasma and a higher protein concentration in small EVs (sEVs) compared to patients without brain metastases and healthy controls. Interestingly, melanoma patients with brain metastases presented decreased STAT3 activation and increased PD-L1 levels in circulating sEVs compared to patients without central nervous system metastases.\n\nConclusionsDecreased STAT3 activation and increased PD-L1 in plasma circulating sEVs identify melanoma patients with brain metastasis.\n\nStatement of translational relevanceBrain metastases are critical for outcomes and quality of life in almost 50% of oncological patients, generally associated with a poor short-term prognosis. Early or preventive diagnosis of this complication represents an unmet need. There is a necessity of discovering new biomarkers that could aid to predict disease outcome.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed plasma circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from a cohort of 92 patients with different solid tumors (lung, breast, kidney cancer and melanoma) and found that newly diagnosed patients with brain metastases presented lower number of circulating particles and a higher protein concentration in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) compared to patients without brain metastases and healthy controls. Out of all groups analyzed, melanoma patients with brain metastases presented decreased STAT3 activation and increased PD-L1 levels in circulating sEVs compared to patients without central nervous system metastases.\n\nThe data presented in this work suggest that circulating sEVs may represent the immunosuppressive status of newly diagnosed brain metastases characterized by the reduced phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) and increased PD-L1, although the origin of these molecules found in circulating sEVs remains to be uncovered.",

Conversely, the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol-A (BPA), which exerts multiple effects in this cell type via the same estrogen receptors, increased basal apoptosis. The molecular initiated events that trigger these opposite actions have yet to be identified. We demonstrated that combined genetic downregulation and pharmacological blockade of each estrogen receptor increased apoptosis to a different extent. The increase in apoptosis induced by BPA was diminished by the pharmacological blockade or the genetic silencing of GPER, and it was partially reproduced by the GPER agonist G1. BPA and G1-induced apoptosis were abolished upon pharmacological inhibition, silencing of ER and ER{beta}, or in dispersed islet cells from ER{beta} knockout (BERKO) mice. Yet, the ER and ER{beta} agonists, PPT and DPN, respectively, had no effect on beta cell viability. To exert their biological actions, ER and ER{beta} form homodimers and heterodimers. Molecular dynamic simulations together with proximity ligand assay and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the interaction of BPA with ER and ER{beta} as well as the GPER activation by G1 decreased ER{beta} heterodimers. We propose that ER{beta} heterodimers play an antiapoptotic role in beta cells and that BPA- and G1-induced decrease in ER{beta} heterodimers leads to beta cell apoptosis.

Non-typhoidal Salmonella is classified among the multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens of international concern. To predict their multidrug resistance potentials, 19 assembled genomes (partial genomes) of 23 non-typhoidal Salmonella isolated at the Yaounde abattoir between December 2014 and November 2015 from live cattle (n=1), beef carcass (n=19), butchers hands (n=1) and the beef processing environments (n=2) were explored using whole-genome sequencing. Phenotypically, while approximately 22% (n=5) of Salmonella isolates showed moderate resistance to streptomycin, 13.04 % (n=3) were multidrug-resistant. Genotypically, all the Salmonella isolates possessed high multidrug resistance potentials against several classes of antibiotics (third-generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone), which are assigned highest priority drugs by the World Health Organization. Moreover, more than 31% of the isolates exhibited resistance potentials to polymyxin, considered as the last resort drug with both clinical and veterinary relevance. Additionally, close to 80% of non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates in this study harboured   silent resistant genes and thus constituted potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance to other foodborne bacteria. Plasmids also appear to play a critical role in the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes of some isolates. The isolates showed a high degree of pathogenicity and possessed key effector proteins to establish infection in their hosts, including humans. The overall results demand prudent use of antibiotics and constant monitoring of antimicrobial resistance of non-typhoidal Salmonella in the Cameroonian abattoirs.\n\nAuthor summaryNon-typhoidal Salmonella has been classified among the multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens of international concern. A growing resistance to a broad range of antibacterial compounds in animals and clinical settings has been reported in Non-Typhoidal Salmonella. Current knowledge of their antibiotic resistance profile is essential to inform policy decisions for the choice of appropriate management of invasive salmonellosis. The significance of our research consists in predicting the multidrug resistance, pathogenicity and virulence potentials of Salmonella organisms using whole genome sequencing. This unveils the need for the development of a diagnostic model that takes into account the genotype-phenotype antibacterial resistance profile of Salmonella, which is of both clinical and veterinary relevance.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundWithdrawal of problematic scientific articles after publication is one of the mechanisms for correcting the literature available to publishers, especially in the conditions of the ever-increasing trend of publishing activity in the medical field. The market volume and the business model justify publishers involvement in the post-publication quality control(QC) of scientific production. The limited information about this subject determined us to analyze retractions and the main retraction reasons for publishers with many withdrawn articles. We also propose a score to measure the evolution of their performance. The data set used for this article consists of 4844 PubMed retracted papers published between 1.01.2009 and 31.12.2020.\n\nMethodsWe have analyzed the retraction notes and retraction reasons, grouping them by publisher. To evaluate performance, we formulated an SDTP score whose calculation formula includes several parameters: speed (article exposure time(ET)), detection rate (percentage of articles whose retraction is initiated by the editor/publisher/institution without the authors participation), transparency (percentage of retracted articles available online and clarity of retraction notes), precision (mention of authors responsibility and percentage of retractions for reasons other than editorial errors).\n\nResultsThe 4844 withdrawn articles were published in 1767 journals by 366 publishers, the average number of withdrawn articles/journal being 2.74. Forty-five publishers have more than ten withdrawn articles, holding 88% of all papers and 79% of journals. Combining our data with data from another study shows that less than 7% of PubMed journals withdrew at least one article. Only 10.5% of the withdrawal notes included the individual responsibility of the authors. Nine of the top 11 publishers had the largest number of articles withdrawn in 2020, in the first 11 places finding, as expected, some big publishers. Retraction reasons analysis shows considerable differences between publishers concerning the articles ET: median values between 9 and 43 months (mistakes), 9 and 73 months (images), 10 and 42 months (plagiarism & overlap).\n\nThe SDTP score shows, between 2018 and 2020, an improvement in QC of four publishers in the top 11 and a decrease in the gap between 1st and 11th place. The group of the other 355 publishers also has a positive evolution of the SDTP score.\n\nConclusionsPublishers have to get involved actively and measurably in the post-publication evaluation of scientific products. The introduction of reporting standards for retraction notes and replicable indicators for quantifying publishing QC can help increase the overall quality of scientific literature.",

Because the genome sequence for one of these isolates is available, we conducted comparative evolutionary analyses of the spike gene of this strain (CCoV-HuPn-2018), with other available Alphacoronavirus 1 spike sequences. The most N-terminus subdomain (0-domain) of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike protein has sequence similarity to Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and CCoV2b strains, but not to other members of the type II Alphacoronaviruses (i.e., CCoV2a and Feline CoV2-FCoV2). This 0-domain in CCoV-HuPn-2018 has evidence for relaxed selection pressure, an increased rate of molecular evolution, and a number of unique amino acid substitutions relative to CCoV2b and TGEV sequences. A region of the 0-domain determined to be key to sialic acid binding and pathogenesis in TGEV had clear differences in amino acid sequences in CCoV-HuPn-2018 relative to both CCoV2b (enteric) and TGEV (enteric and respiratory). The 0-domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 also had several sites inferred to be under positive diversifying selection, including sites within the signal peptide. Downstream of the 0-domain, FCoV2 shared sequence similarity to the CCoV2b and TGEV sequences, with analyses of this larger alignment identifying positively selected sites in the putative Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Connector Domain (CD). Recombination analyses strongly implicated a particular FCoV2 strain in the recombinant history of CCoV-HuPn-2018 with molecular divergence times estimated at around 60 years ago. We hypothesize that CCoV-HuPn-2018 had an enteric origin, but that it has lost that particular tropism, because of mutations in the sialic acid binding region of the spike 0-domain. As selection pressure on this region was reduced, the virus evolved a respiratory tropism, analogous to other Alphacoronavirus 1, such as Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV), that have lost this region entirely. We also suggest that signals of positive selection in the signal peptide as well as other changes in the 0-domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 could represent an adaptive role in this new host and that this could be in part due to the different spatial distribution of the N-linked glycan repertoire for this strain.",

As potential pandemic vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines and protein-based vaccines have been rapidly developed to prevent pandemic spread worldwide. In this study, we designed plasmid DNA vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S protein) as pandemic vaccine, and the humoral, cellular, and functional immune responses were characterized to support proceeding to initial human clinical trials. After intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine encoding S protein with alum adjuvant (three times at 2-week intervals), the humoral immunoreaction, as assessed by anti-S protein or anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, and the cellular immunoreaction, as assessed by antigen-induced IFN{gamma} expression, were up-regulated. In IgG subclass analysis, IgG2b was induced as the main subclass. Based on these analyses, DNA vaccine with alum adjuvant preferentially induced Th1-type T cell polarization. We confirmed the neutralizing action of DNA vaccine-induced antibodies via two different methods, a binding assay of RBD recombinant protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and pseudovirus assay. Further B cell epitope mapping analysis using a peptide array showed that most vaccine-induced antibodies recognized the S2 and RBD subunits, but not the S1 subunit. In conclusion, DNA vaccine targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 might be an effective and safe approach to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Karanjin, an abundantly occurring furanoflavonoid in edible and non-edible legumes, exerts diverse biological effects in vivo, and in vitro. Its potential as an anticancer agent is also gaining traction following recent demonstrations of its anti-proliferative, cell cycle inhibitory, and pro-apoptotic effects. However, the universality of its anticancer potential is yet to be scrutinized, particularly so because flavonoids can act as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Even the genomic correlates of its biological activities are yet to be examined in hormone responsive cells. This paper presents the early and direct transcriptomic footprint of 10 M karanjin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, using next generation sequencing technology (RNA-seq). We show that karanjin-modulated gene-expression repertoire is enriched in several hallmark gene sets, which include early estrogen-response, and G2/M checkpoint genes. Genes modulated by karanjin overlapped with those modulated by 1 nM 17{beta}-estradiol (E2), or 1 M tamoxifen. Karanjin altered the expression of selected estrogen-regulated genes in a cell-type, and concentration dependent manner. It downmodulated the expression of ER protein in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, ER knockdown negatively impacted karanjins ability to modulate the expression of selected E2 target genes. Our data suggest that karanjin exerts its effects on ER-positive breast cancer cells, at least in part, via ER. The apparent SERM-like effects of karanjin pose a caveat to the anticancer potential of karanjin. In-depth studies on cell-type and concentration-dependent effects of karanjin may bring out its true potential in endocrine therapies.",

However, the recent description of a wide spectrum of phenotypes in multiple tissues in patients harboring LTBP1 pathogenic variants suggests a multifaceted role of the protein in the homeostasis of connective tissues. To better understand the human pathology caused by LTBP1 deficiency it is important to investigate its functional role in extracellular matrix formation. In this study, we show that LTBP1 coordinates the incorporation of fibrillin-1 and -2 into the extracellular matrix in vitro. We also demonstrate that this function is differentially exerted by the two isoforms, the short and long forms of LTBP1. Thereby our findings uncover a novel TGF{beta}-independent LTBP1 function potentially contributing to the development of connective tissue disorders.",

Accordingly, dysregulation of lipid metabolism leads to the photoreceptor cell death and retinal degeneration. Mice with a frameshift mutation of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (Lpcat1), which produces saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) composed of two saturated fatty acids, has been reported to cause spontaneous retinal degeneration (rd11 mice). In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of LPCAT1 in the retina and found that genetic deletion of Lpcat1 induces light-independent and photoreceptor-specific apoptosis in mice. Lipidomic analyses of the retina and isolated photoreceptor outer segment (OS) suggested that loss of Lpcat1 decreases saturated PC production and affects the proper cellular fatty acid flux, presumably by altering saturated fatty acyl-CoA availabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lpcat1 deletion increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in photoreceptor cells, but not in other retinal cells without affecting the OS structure and trafficking of OS-localized proteins. These results suggest that the LPCAT1-dependent production of saturated PC is critical for metabolic adaptation during photoreceptor maturation. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of saturated fatty acid metabolism in photoreceptor cell degeneration-related retinal diseases.",

ZIKV infection of the central nervous system has been linked to a variety of clinical syndromes, including microcephaly in fetuses and rare but serious neurologic disease in adults. However, the potential for ZIKV to influence brain physiology and host behavior following recovery from apparently mild or subclinical infection is less well understood. Furthermore, though deficits in cognitive function are well-documented following recovery from neuroinvasive viral infection, the potential impact of ZIKV on other host behavioral domains has not been thoroughly explored. In our study, we performed transcriptomic profiling of primary neuron cultures following ZIKV infection, which revealed altered expression of key genes associated with major psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Gene ontology enrichment analysis also revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with fundamental neurobiological processes, including neuronal development, neurotransmission, and others. These alterations to neurologic gene expression were also observed in the brain in vivo using an immunocompetent mouse model of ZIKV infection. Mechanistic studies identified TNF- signaling via TNFR1 as a major regulatory mechanism controlling ZIKV-induced changes to neurologic gene expression. Our studies reveal that cell-intrinsic innate immune responses to ZIKV infection profoundly shape neuronal transcriptional profiles, highlighting the need to further explore associations between ZIKV infection and disordered host behavioral states.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Global changes in DNA methylation are observed in developmental and disease contexts, and singlecell analyses are highlighting the heterogeneous regulation of these processes. However, technical challenges associated with single-cell analysis of DNA methylation limit these studies. We present single-cell transposable element methylation sequencing (scTEM-seq) for cost-effective estimation of global DNA methylation levels. By targeting high-copy LINE-1 and SINE Alu elements, we achieve amplicon bisulphite sequencing with thousands of loci covered in each library. Parallel transcriptome analysis is also performed to link global DNA methylation heterogeneity with gene expression. We apply scTEM-seq to KG1a acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, and primary AML cells. Decitabine treatment of KG1a cells induces global DNA methylation heterogeneity associated with altered expression of immune process genes. We also compare global levels of DNA methylation to expression of transposable elements and find a predominance of negative correlations in both the KG1a and patient cells. Finally, we observe co-ordinated upregulation of many transposable elements in a sub-set of decitabine treated cells. By linking global DNA methylation heterogeneity with transcription, scTEM-seq will refine our understanding of epigenetic regulation in cancer and beyond.",

After polishing and contaminant removal, the final assembly was 272 Mb (4,687 contigs, N50 = 1.16 Mb). Our reference genome contains 98.5% of the core Hymenoptera BUSCOs and was scaffolded using the pseudo-chromosomal assembly of a related species, F. selysi (28 scaffolds, N50 = 8.49 Mb). Around one third of the genome consists of repeats, and 17,426 gene models were annotated using both protein and RNAseq data (97.4% BUSCO completeness). This resource is of comparable quality to the few other single individual insect genomes assembled to date and paves the way to genomic studies of admixture in natural populations and comparative genomic approaches in Formica wood ants.",

It is likely that it compacts DNA via an ATP hydrolysis-dependent, DNA loop-extrusion reaction as has been demonstrated for the yeast SMC proteins condensin and cohesin. MukB also interacts with the ParC subunit of the cellular chromosomal decatenase topoisomerase IV, an interaction that is required for proper chromosome condensation and segregation in E. coli, although it suppresses the MukB ATPase activity. We have investigated the MukBEF ATPase activity, identifying inter- and intra-subunit interactions by protein-protein crosslinking and site-specific mutagenesis. We show that interactions between the hinge of MukB and its neck region are essential for the ATPase activity, that the ParC subunit of Topo IV inhibits the MukB ATPase by preventing this interaction, that MukE interaction with DNA is likely essential for viability, and that interactions between MukF and the MukB neck region are necessary for ATPase activity and viability.",

Development of novel noninvasive diagnostic and predictive pathophysiological biomarkers would represent a significant clinical improvement. Here, we explored the utility of non-invasive 23Na MRI to profile tumour physiology using preclinical mouse models of breast cancer. We establish that tissue Na+ concentration ([Na+]) is elevated vs non-tumour regions across multiple different tumour models. Ex vivo SBFI fluorescence imaging corroborated that this elevation in tumour [Na+] is due to increased intracellular [Na+]. Effective treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy reduced tumour tissue [Na+], but was not detected by 1H diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Moreover, combining 23Na MRI and DWI measurements enabled superior classification accuracy of tumour vs non-tumour regions compared to either parameter alone. Quantification of breast tumour tissue [Na+] using 23Na MRI thus represents a novel, accurate, non-invasive diagnostic and predictive imaging biomarker.",

Effects of genetic variations on gene regulation are cell-type-specific and cellular-context-related, so studying eQTLs at a single-cell level is crucial. The ideal solution is to use both mutation and expression data from the same cells. However, current technology of such paired data in single cells is still immature. We present a new method, eQTLsingle, to discover eQTLs only with single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, without genomic data. It detects mutations from scRNA-seq data and models gene expression of different genotypes with the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model to find associations between genotypes and phenotypes at single-cell level. On a glioblastoma and gliomasphere scRNA-seq dataset, eQTLsingle discovered hundreds of cell-type-specific tumor-related eQTLs, most of which cannot be found in bulk eQTL studies. Detailed analyses on examples of the discovered eQTLs revealed important underlying regulatory mechanisms. eQTLsingle is a unique powerful tool for utilizing the huge scRNA-seq resources for single-cell eQTL studies, and it is available for free academic use at https://github.com/horsedayday/eQTLsingle.",

While it is well established that the lifestyle of the host, dietary preferences, demographic background, and health status can influence microbial community composition and dynamics, robust generalizable associations between specific host-associated factors and specific microbial taxa have remained largely elusive. Here, we propose factor regression models that allow the estimation of structured parsimonious associations between host-related features and amplicon-derived microbial taxa. To account for the overdispersed nature of the amplicon sequencing count data, we propose Negative Binomial reduced rank regression (NB-RRR) and Negative Binomial co-sparse factor regression (NB-FAR). While NB-RRR encodes the underlying dependency among the microbial abundances as outcomes and the host-associated features as predictors through a rank-constrained coefficient matrix, NB-FAR uses a sparse singular value decomposition of the coefficient matrix. The latter approach avoids the notoriously difficult joint parameter estimation by extracting sparse unit-rank components of the coefficient matrix sequentially. To solve the non-convex optimization problems associated with these factor regression models, we present a novel iterative block-wise majorization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and an application to the microbial abundance data from the American Gut Project demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed procedure. In the American Gut Project data, we identify key factors that strongly link dietary habits and host life style to specific microbial families.",

We visualized cell cycle progression in TNNT2-FUCCI and found G2 cycle arrest in endoreplicating cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we devised a live-cell compound screening platform to identify pro-proliferative drug candidates. We found that the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine induced cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro and increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry in neonatal mice.

    "preprint_abstract": "Ocean warming is a particularly challenging threat for tropical marine bivalves species because many live already near their upper thermal limits. The thermal sensitivity of organisms is a strong contributor to the biogeographic boundaries of populations and species. The potential of thermal plastic response (range of thermal breadth) is typically reduced for marine populations living in stable thermal environments, e.g., in extreme latitudes organisms as traduced in the climatic variability hypothesis. However, regional-scale heterogeneity among tropical environments, such as archipelagos in French Polynesia, might also serve in modulating this plastic potential. The questions remain now, how tropical organisms are able to cope with abnormally elevated temperature on long-term (several weeks) and how environmental-variability might drive the potential of resilience? To answer these questions, we benefit from two ecologically divergent populations of a marine tropical mollusc species, Pinctada margaritifera, that usually experience either large diurnal variations (tide-pools, Marquesas archipelago) or lower temperature with stable to moderate variations (Gambier archipelago). Individuals were maintained in common garden experiment at several controlled temperature conditions (23{degrees}C, 28{degrees}C, 32{degrees}C and 34{degrees}C) over a 48 days period. We explored genetic divergence as well as thermal plastic responses by combining lipidomic and transcriptomic approaches. We show that P. margaritifera have capacities to adjust to long-term elevated temperatures that was thus far largely underestimated. Furthermore, we identified genetic variation between populations that overlapped with genes expression variations, including genes involved in the respiration machinery, a central process delimiting critical temperatures in marine invertebrates. This study is the first of a series looking at the global adaptation and acclimation mechanisms in response to climate change in Pinctada species.",

There are reports of vascular morphological recovery following traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the remodeling process has not been examined longitudinally in detail after injury in vivo. Understanding the dynamic processes that influence recovery is thus critically important. We evaluated the longitudinal and dynamic microvascular recovery and remodeling up to 2 months post injury using live brain miniscope and 2-photon microscopic imaging. The new imaging approaches captured dynamic morphological and functional recovery processes at high spatial and temporal resolution in vivo. Vessel painting documented the initial loss and subsequent temporal morphological vascular recovery at the injury site. Miniscopes were used to longitudinally image the temporal dynamics of vascular repair in vivo after brain injury in individual mice across each cohort. We observe near-immediate nascent growth of new vessels in and adjacent to the injury site that peaks between 14-21 days post injury. 2-photon microscopy confirms new vascular growth and further demonstrates differences between cortical layers after cortical injury: large vessels persist in deeper cortical layers (>200 m), while superficial layers exhibit a dense plexus of fine (and often non-perfused) vessels displaying regrowth. Functionally, blood flow increases mirror increasing vascular density. Filopodia development and endothelial sprouting is measurable within 3 days post injury that rapidly transforms regions devoid of vessels to dense vascular plexus in which new vessels become increasingly perfused. Within 7 days post injury, blood flow is observed in these nascent vessels. Behavioral analysis reveals improved vascular modulation after 9 days post injury, consistent with vascular regrowth. We conclude that morphological recovery events are closely linked to functional recovery of blood flow to the compromised tissues, which subsequently leads to improved behavioral outcomes.",

In the original study, urinary biomarkers and kidney histopathology scores were determined. Urine was sampled daily and analyzed for urinary metabolites via 1H NMR analysis.\n\nUnsupervised Principal Components Analysis was applied for exploratory data analysis to identify trends and outliers in the spectral data. Then, supervised Orthogonal Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis was applied to classify the samples collected in different days and identify metabolic differences during the treatment. Metabolomes were compared across study groups (i.e. those receiving QD, BID, TID, and control) using a mixed-effects models. Spearman correlation was performed for injury biomarkers and the metabolome.\n\nResultsA total of 27 rats contributed 77 urinary samples; n=25 rats were included that were treated with Polymyxin B and n=2 received saline. Pre-dosing samples clustered well and were characterized by higher amounts of citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, and Hippurate. On day 1 post treatment, day 1 samples showed higher taurine; day 3 samples had higher lactate, acetate and creatine. Taurine was the only metabolite significantly increased in both BID and TID compared to QD group. Taurine on day 1 correlated with increasing histopathology scores (Spearmans rho = 0.4167, P=0.038) and KIM-1 (Spearmans rho =0.4052, P=0.036); whereas KIM-1 on day one and day 3 did not reach significance with histopathology (Spearmans rho = 0.3248, P=0.11 and Spearmans rho = 0.3739, P=0.066).\n\nConclusionPolymyxin B causes increased amounts of urinary taurine on day 1 which then normalizes to baseline concentrations.

This question can be approached empirically by investigating how associating stimuli with oneself leads to differences in neurocognitive processing. However, little is known about the brain network involved in forming such self-associations for, specifically, bodily stimuli. In this fMRI study, we sought to distinguish the neural substrates of representing a full-body movement as ones movement and as someone elses movement. Participants performed a delayed match-to-sample working memory task where a retained full-body movement (displayed using point-light walkers) was arbitrarily labelled as ones own movement or as performed by someone else. By using arbitrary associations we aimed to address a limitation of previous studies, namely that our own movements are more familiar to us than movements of other people. A searchlight multivariate decoding analysis was used to test where information about types of movement and about self-association was coded. Movement specific activation patterns was found in a network of regions also involved in perceptual processing of movement stimuli, however not in early sensory regions. Information about whether a memorized movement was associated with the self or with another person was found to be coded by activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), bilateral supplementary motor area, and (at reduced threshold) in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). These areas are frequently reported as involved in action understanding (IFG, MFG) and domain-general self/other distinction (TPJ). Finally, in univariate analysis we found that selecting a self-associated movement for retention was related to increased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex.",

However, cell-type annotation remains a main challenge as it largely relies on a priori knowledge and manual curation, which is cumbersome and less accurate. The increasing number of scRNA-seq data sets, as well as numerous published genetic studies, motivated us to build a comprehensive human cell type reference atlas. Here, we present deCS (decoding Cell type-Specificity), an automatic cell type annotation method augmented by a comprehensive collection of human cell type expression profiles and marker genes. We used deCS to annotate scRNA-seq data from various tissue types and systematically evaluated the annotation accuracy under different conditions, including reference panels, sequencing depth and feature selection strategies. Our results demonstrated that expanding the references is critical for improving annotation accuracy. Compared to many existing state-of-the-art annotation tools, deCS significantly reduced computation time and increased accuracy. deCS can be integrated into the standard scRNA-seq analytical pipeline to enhance cell type annotation. Finally, we demonstrated the broad utility of deCS to identify trait-cell type associations in 51 human complex traits, providing deeper insights into the cellular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.

Here we validate the accuracy of DeepLabCut (DLC) by comparing it to a 3D x-ray video radiography system that tracks markers placed under the skin (XROMM). We record behavioral data simultaneously with XROMM and high-speed video for DLC as marmosets engage in naturalistic foraging and reconstruct three-dimensional kinematics in a shared coordinate system. We find that DLC tracks position and velocity of 12 markers on the forelimb and torso with low median error (0.272 cm and 1.76 cm/s, respectively) corresponding to 2.9% of the full range of marker positions and 5.9% of the range of speeds. For studies that can accept this relatively small degree of error, DLC and similar marker-less pose estimation tools enable the study of more naturalistic, unconstrained behaviors in many fields including non-human primate motor control.\n\nSummary StatementWe validate the accuracy of DeepLabCut, a widely used marker-less pose estimation tool, using a marker-based 3D x-ray radiography system (XROMM).",

    "preprint_abstract": "Ocean temperatures continue to rise due to climate change but it is unclear if heat tolerance of marine organisms will keep pace with warming. Understanding how tolerance scales from individuals to species and quantifying adaptive potentials is essential to forecasting responses to warming. We reproductively crossed corals from a globally distributed species (Acropora tenuis) on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) from three thermally distinct reefs to create 85 offspring lineages. Individuals were experimentally exposed to temperatures (27.5, 31, and 35.5 {degrees}C) in adult and two critical early life stages (larval and settlement) to assess acquired heat tolerance via outcrossing of offspring phenotypes by comparing five physiological responses (photosynthetic yields, bleaching, necrosis, settlement, and survival). Adaptive potentials and physiological reaction norms were calculated across three stages to integrate heat tolerance at different biological scales. Selective breeding improved larval survival to heat by 1.5 - 2.5x but did not result in substantial enhancement of settlement, although population crosses were significantly different. At heat, adults were less variable compared to larval responses in warmer reefs compared to the cooler reef. Adults and offspring also differed in their mean population responses, likely underpinned by heat stress imposing strong divergent selection on adults. These results have implications for downstream selection during reproduction, evidenced by variability in a conserved heat tolerance response across offspring lineages. These results inform our ability to forecast the impacts of climate change on wild populations of corals and will aid in developing novel conservation tools like the assisted evolution of at-risk species.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTHeat stress exerts disruptive selection on adult corals. This likely underpins variability in offspring survival and results in differences in offspring responses to selection.",

Grape seed extract (GSE), a commonly used health supplement, is a mixture of plant-derived polyphenols. Polyphenols possess anti-microbial and -fungal properties, but anti-viral effects are not well-known. Here we show that GSE outperformed chemical disinfectants (e.g., free chlorine and peracetic acids) in inactivating Tulane virus, a human norovirus surrogate. GSE induced virus aggregation, an event that correlated with a decrease in virus titers. This aggregation and disinfection was not reversible. Molecular docking simulations indicate that polyphenols potentially formed hydrogen bonds and strong hydrophobic interactions with specific residues in viral capsid proteins. Together, these data suggest that polyphenols physically associate with viral capsid proteins to aggregate viruses as a means to inhibit virus entry into the host cell. Plant-based polyphenols like GSE are an attractive alternative to chemical disinfectants to remove infectious viruses from water or food.\n\nImportanceHuman noroviruses are major food- and water-borne pathogens, causing approximately 20% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis cases in developing and developed countries. Proper sanitation or disinfection are critical strategies to minimize human norovirus-caused disease until a reliable vaccine is created. Grape seed extract (GSE) is a mixture of plant-derived polyphenols that is used as a health supplement. Polyphenols are known for antimicrobial, antifungal, and antibiofilm activities, but antiviral effects are not well-known. In studies here, plant-derived polyphenols outperformed chemical disinfectants (e.g., free chlorine and peracetic acids) in inactivating Tulane virus, a human norovirus surrogate. Based on data from additional molecular assays and molecular docking simulations, the current model is that the polyphenols in GSE bind to the Tulane virus capsid, an event that triggers virion aggregation. It is thought that this aggregation prevents Tulane virus from entering host cells.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Drug resistance mutations tend to disrupt key physiological processes, and therefore carry a fitness cost. The size of these fitness costs is a central determinant of the rate of spread of these mutations in natural populations so are important to quantify. Head-to-head competition assays provide a standard approach to measuring differential fitness, and have been used extensively for malaria parasites. These assays typically use standardized culture media, containing RPMI 1640, which has a 1.4 to 5.5-fold (mean: 2.6-fold) higher concentration of amino acids than human blood. In this rich media we predict that fitness costs will be underestimated because resource competition is weak. We tested this prediction using an artemisinin sensitive parasite edited to contain kelch-C580Y or R561H mutations conferring resistance to artemisinin or synonymous control mutations. We examined the impact of these single amino acid mutations on fitness, using replicated head-to head competition experiments conducted in media containing (i) normal RPMI, (ii) modified RPMI with reduced amino acid concentration, (iii) RPMI containing only isoleucine, or (iv) 3-fold diluted RPMI. We found a significant 1.3 to 1.4-fold increase in fitness costs measured in modified and isoleucine-only media relative to normal media, while fitness costs were 2.5-fold higher in diluted media. We conclude that fitness costs are strongly affected by media composition and will be significantly underestimated in normal RPMI. Elevated fitness costs in nature will limit spread of ART-resistance but will also promote evolution of compensatory mutations that restore fitness, and can be exploited to maximize selection in laboratory experiments.",

Extensive evidence suggests that androgens (e.g. testosterone) are involved in the modulation of territorial behaviour in male vertebrates. Short-term increase of androgen following a territorial encounter appears to favour the outcome of a challenge. The \"Challenge Hypothesis\" proposed by Wingfield and colleagues outlines the existence of a positive feedback relationship between androgen and social challenges (e.g. territorial intrusions) in male vertebrates. Here we tested the challenge hypothesis in the highly territorial poison frog, Allobates femoralis, in its natural habitat by exposing males to simulated territorial intrusions in form of acoustic playbacks. We quantified repeatedly androgen concentrations of individual males via a non-invasive water-borne sampling approach. Our results show that A. femoralis males exhibited a positive behavioural and androgenic response after being confronted to simulated territorial intrusions, providing support for the Challenge Hypothesis in a territorial frog.",

Thereby, they sort many plasma membrane receptors and transporters and control cellular signaling and metabolism. How the membrane fission events are catalyzed is poorly understood. Here, we identify the novel CROP complex as a factor acting at this step. CROP joins members of two protein families: the peripheral subunits of retromer, a coat forming endosomal transport carriers, and membrane inserting PROPPINs. Integration into CROP potentiates the membrane fission activity of the PROPPIN Atg18 on synthetic liposomes and confers strong preference for binding PI(3,5)P2, a phosphoinositide required for membrane fission activity. Disrupting CROP blocks fragmentation of lysosome-like yeast vacuoles in vivo. CROP-deficient mammalian endosomes accumulate micrometer-long tubules and fail to export cargo, suggesting that carriers attempt to form but cannot separate from these organelles. PROPPINs compete for retromer binding with the SNX proteins, which recruit retromer to the membrane during the formation of endosomal carriers. Transition from retromer-SNX complexes to retromer-PROPPIN complexes might hence switch retromer activities from cargo capture to membrane fission.",

Understanding intermittent nicotine intake is a high priority, as it could promote therapeutic strategies to attenuate tobacco consumption. We examined nicotine intake behavior and neurobiological changes in male rats that were trained to self-administer nicotine during brief (5 min) trials interspersed with longer (15 min) drug-free periods. Rats readily adapted to intermittent access (IntA) SA following acquisition on a continuous access (ContA) schedule. Probabilistic analysis of IntA nicotine SA suggested reduced nicotine loading behavior compared to ContA, and nicotine pharmacokinetic modeling revealed that rats taking nicotine intermittently may have increased intake to maintain blood levels of nicotine that are comparable to ContA SA. After IntA nicotine SA, rats exhibited an increase in unreinforced responses for nicotine-associated cues (incubation of craving) and specific alterations in the striatal proteome after 7 days without nicotine. IntA nicotine SA also induced nAChR functional upregulation in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), and it enhanced nicotine binding in the brain as determined via [11C]nicotine positron emission tomography. Reducing the saliency of the cue conditions during the 5 min access periods attenuated nicotine intake, but incubation of craving was preserved. Together, these results indicate that IntA conditions promote nicotine SA and nicotine seeking after a nicotine-free period.",

But understanding how the brains microscale physiology shapes brain dynamics at the macroscale has remained a challenge. While physiologically based mathematical models of brain dynamics are well placed to bridge this explanatory gap, their complexity can form a barrier to providing clear mechanistic interpretation of the dynamics they generate. In this work we develop a neural-mass model of the mouse cortex and show how bifurcation diagrams, which capture local dynamical responses to inputs and their variation across brain regions, can be used to understand the resulting whole-brain dynamics. We show that strong fits to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can be found in surprisingly simple dynamical regimes--including where all brain regions are confined to a stable fixed point--in which regions are able to respond strongly to variations in their inputs, consistent with direct structural connections providing a strong constraint on functional connectivity in the anesthetized mouse. We also use bifurcation diagrams to show how perturbations to local excitatory and inhibitory coupling strengths across the cortex, constrained by cell-density data, provide spatially dependent constraints on resulting cortical activity, and support a greater diversity of coincident dynamical regimes. Our work illustrates methods for visualizing and interpreting model performance in terms of underlying dynamical mechanisms, an approach that is crucial for building explanatory and physiologically grounded models of the dynamical principles that underpin large-scale brain activity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Reward can improve motor learning and the consolidation of motor memories. Identifying the features of reward feedback that are critical for motor learning is a necessary step for successful integration into rehabilitation programs. One central feature of reward feedback that may affect motor learning is its timing - that is, the delay after which reward is delivered following movement execution. In fact, research on associative learning has shown that short and long reward delays (e.g., 1 and 6 s following action execution) activate preferentially the striatum and the hippocampus, respectively, which both contribute with varying degrees to motor learning. Given the distinct functional role of these two areas, we hypothesized that reward timing could modulate how people learn and consolidate a new motor skill. In sixty healthy participants, we found that delaying reward delivery by a few seconds influenced motor learning dynamics. Indeed, training with a short reward delay (i.e., 1 s) induced slow, yet continuous gains in performance, while a long reward delay (i.e., 6 s) led to initially high learning rates that were followed by an early plateau in the learning curve and a lower endpoint performance. Moreover, participants who successfully learned the skill with a short reward delay displayed overnight consolidation, while those who trained with a long reward delay exhibited an impairment in the consolidation of the motor memory. Overall, our data show that reward timing affects motor learning, potentially by modulating the engagement of different learning processes, a finding that could be exploited in future rehabilitation programs.",

Mutation profiling revealed genetic alterations in seven cancer-related genes, while transcriptomic analyses showed changes in gene expression with cells that invade vessels. Tail vein injection of HepT1 cells resulted in multifocal, metastatic disease.

In this pilot, we sought to assess the utility of an integrated analysis of metabolomic and microRNA data in peripheral blood to distinguish patients with abnormal cardiac stress testing from matched controls.\n\nMethodsWe used prospectively collected samples from emergency department (ED) patients placed in an ED-based observation unit who underwent stress testing for ACS. We isolated microRNA and quantified metabolites from plasma collected before and after stress testing in patients with myocardial ischemia on stress testing versus those with normal stress tests. The combined metabolomic and microRNA data were analyzed jointly for case (ischemia) and 1:1 matched control patients in a supervised, dimension-reducing discriminant analysis. Two integrative models were implemented: a baseline model utilizing data collected prior to stress-testing (T0) and a stress-delta model, which included the difference between post-stress test (T1) and pre-stress test (T0).\n\nResultsSeven case patients with myocardial ischemia on ED cardiac stress testing (6 females, 85% Caucasian, mean Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction Score=3, 4 patients ultimately received percutaneous coronary intervention) were 1:1 age and sex-matched to controls. Several metabolites and microRNAs were differentially expressed between cases and controls. Integrative analysis of the baseline levels of metabolites and microRNA expression showed modest performance for distinguishing cases from controls with an overall error rate of 0.143. The stress-delta model showed worse performance for distinguishing cases from controls, with an overall error rate of 0.500.\n\nConclusionsGiven our small sample size, results are hypothesis-generating. However, this pilot study shows a potential method for a precision medicine approach to cardiac stress testing in patients undergoing workup for ACS.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The cellular milieu is teeming with biochemical nano-machines whose activity is a strong source of correlated non-thermal fluctuations termed active noise. Essential elements of this circuitry are enzymes, catalysts that speed up the rate of metabolic reactions by orders of magnitude, thereby making life possible. Here, we examine the possibility that active noise in the cell, or in vitro, affects enzymatic catalytic rate by accelerating or decelerating the crossing rate of energy barriers during the reaction. Considering hydrodynamic perturbations induced by biochemical activity as a source of active noise, we evaluate their impact on the enzymatic cycle using a combination of analytic and numerical methods. Our estimates show that the fast component of the active noise spectrum enhances the rate of enzymes, while reactions remain practically unaffected by the slow noise spectrum. Revisiting the physics of barrier crossing under the influence of active hydrodynamic fluctuations suggests that the biochemical activity of macromolecules such as enzymes is coupled to active noise. Thus, we propose that enzymatic catalysis is a collective, many-body process in which enzymes may affect each others activity via long-range hydrodynamic interaction, with potential impact on biochemical networks in living and artificial systems alike.",

The F1 and FO motors oppose each others action on a shared rotor subcomplex and are held stationary relative to each other by a peripheral stalk. Structures of resting mitochondrial ATP synthases revealed a left-handed curvature of the peripheral stalk even though rotation of the rotor, driven by either ATP hydrolysis in F1 or proton translocation through FO, would apply a right-handed bending force to the stalk. We used cryoEM to image yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase under strain during ATP-hydrolysis-driven rotary catalysis, revealing a large deformation of the peripheral stalk. The structures show how the peripheral stalk opposes the bending force and suggests that proton translocation during ATP synthesis causes accumulation of strain in the stalk, which relaxes by driving the relative rotation of the rotor through six sub-steps within F1, leading to catalysis.",

Motivated by promising results in prostate cancer there is growing interest in extending this approach to other cancers. Here we present a theoretical study of intra-tumoral competition during adaptive therapy, to identify under which circumstances it will be superior to aggressive treatment; (2) Methods: We use a 2-D, on-lattice, agent-based tumour model to examine the impact of different microenvironmental factors on the comparison between continuous drug administration and adaptive therapy. (3) Results: We show that the degree of crowding, the initial resistance fraction, the presence of resistance costs, and the rate of tumour cell turnover are key determinants of the benefit of adaptive therapy, and we study in detail how these factors alter competition between cells. We find that intra-specific competition between resistant cells plays an unexpectedly important role in the ability to control resistance. To conclude we show how differences in resistance cost and turnover change the tumours spatial organisation and may explain differences in cycling speed observed in a cohort of 67 prostate cancer patients undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy; (4) Conclusion: Our work provides insights into how adaptive therapy leverages inter- and intra-specific competition to control resistance, and shows that the tumours spatial architecture will likely be an important factor in determining the quantitative benefit of adaptive therapy in patients.",

Estrogen receptor  positive (ER+) breast cancer accounts for 70% of all breast cancer subtypes. Although ER+ breast cancer initially responds to estrogen deprivation or blockade, resistance emergence compelling the use of more aggressive therapies. While ER is a driver in ER+ breast cancer, ER{beta} plays an inhibitory role in several different cancer types. To date, the lack of highly selective ER{beta} agonists without ER activity has limited the exploration of ER{beta} activation as a strategy for ER+ breast cancer.\n\nMethodsWe measured expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2 genes in immortalized mammary epithelial cells and different breast cancer cell lines. The viability of ER+ breast cancer cell lines upon treatments with specific ER{beta} agonists, including OSU-ERb-12 and LY500307 was assessed. The specificity of the ER{beta} agonists, OSU-ERb-12 and LY500307, was confirmed by reporter assays. The effects of the agonists on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, colony formation, cell migration, and expression of tumor suppressor proteins were analyzed. The expression of ESR2 and genes containing ERE-AP1 composite response elements was examined in ER+ human breast cancer samples to determine the correlation between ESR2 expression and overall survival and that of putative ESR2 regulated genes.\n\nResultsIn this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of highly selective ER{beta} agonists in ER+ breast cancer cell lines and drug-resistant derivatives. ER{beta} agonists blocked cell proliferation, migration and colony formation; and induced apoptosis and S and/or G2/M cell cycle arrest of ER+ breast cancer cell lines. Also, increases in the expression of the key tumor suppressors FOXO1 and FOXO3a were noted. Importantly, the strong synergy between ER{beta} agonists and ER antagonists suggested that the efficacy of ER{beta} agonists is maximized by combination with ER blockade. Lastly, ESR2 (ER{beta} gene) expression was negatively correlated with ESR1 (ER gene) and CCND1 RNA expression in human metastatic ER+/HER2-breast cancer samples.\n\nConclusionOur results demonstrate that highly selective ER{beta} agonists attenuate the viability of ER+ breast cancer cell lines in vitro and suggest that this therapeutic strategy merits further evaluation for ER+ breast cancer.",

It inhibits host-cell translation, primarily through a direct interaction between its C-terminal domain and the mRNA entry channel of the 40S small ribosomal subunit, with an N-terminal {beta}-barrel domain fine-tuning the inhibition and promoting selective translation of viral mRNA. SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 is a target of recurring deletions, some of which are associated with altered COVID-19 disease progression. To provide the biochemical basis for this, it is essential to characterize the efficiency of translational inhibition by the said protein variants. Here, we use an in vitro translation system to investigate the translation inhibition capacity of a series of clinically observed Nsp1 deletion variants. We find that a frequently observed deletion of residues 79-89 destabilized the N-terminal domain (NTD) and severely reduced the capacity of Nsp1 to inhibit translation. Interestingly, shorter deletions in the same region have been reported to effect the type I interferon response but did not affect translation inhibition, indicating a possible translation-independent role of the Nsp1 NTD in interferon response modulation. Taken together, our data provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how deletions in Nsp1 influence SARS-CoV-2 induction of interferon response and COVID-19 progression.",

Accelerated puberty is also associated with a heightened risk for psychopathology in later life but there is a dearth of evidence on the impacts of maternal infection on pubertal timing. We examined the effects of MIA on reproductive development, mechanical allodynia, and sensorimotor gating in juvenile, adolescent, and adult male and female mice. Moreover, we investigated hypothalamic neural markers associated with the reproductive and stress axes. Finally, we tested the mitigating effects of environmental enrichment (EE), which has clinical relevancy in human rehabilitation settings. Our results show that administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) on gestational day 12.5 led to early preputial separation, vaginal openings, and age of first estrus in offspring. MIA exposure altered pain sensitivity across development and modestly altered prepulse inhibition. The downregulation of Nr3c1 and Oprk mRNA in the hypothalamus of juvenile mice suggests that MIAs effects may be mediated through disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. In contrast, life-long housing with EE rescued many of these MIA-induced consequences. Overall, our findings suggest that accelerated puberty may be associated with the deleterious effects of infection during pregnancy and the onset of psychopathology.",

LOS/AOS shares phenotypes and epigenotypes with the human congenital overgrowth condition Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We have reported that LOS occurs spontaneously (SLOS), however, to date, no study has been conducted to determine if SLOS has the same methylome epimutations as ART-LOS. In this study, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing to examine global DNA methylation in SLOS and ART-LOS tissues. We observed unique patterns of global distribution of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) over different genomic contexts, such as promoters, CpG islands and surrounding regions, and repetitive sequences from different treatment groups. In addition, we identified hundreds of LOS-vulnerable DMRs across different cattle breeds when analyzing four idependent LOS experiments together. Specifically, there are 25 highly vulnerable DMRs that could potentially serve as molecular markers for the diagnosis of LOS, including at the promoters of DMRT2 and TBX18, at the imprinted gene bodies of IGF2R, PRDM8, and BLCAP/NNAT, and at multiple CpG islands. We also observed tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns between muscle and blood, and conservation of ART-induced DNA methylation changes between muscle and blood. We conclude that as in ART-LOS, alterations of the epigenome are involved in the etiology of SLOS. In addition, SLOS and ART-LOS share some similarities in methylome epimutations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The ability to accurately control our posture and perceive spatial orientation during self-motion requires knowledge of the motion of both the head and body. However, whereas the vestibular sensors and nuclei directly encode head motion, no sensors directly encode body motion. Instead, the integration of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs is necessary to transform vestibular information into the body-centric reference frame required for postural control. The anterior vermis of the cerebellum is thought to play a key role in this transformation, yet how its Purkinje cells integrate these inputs or what information they dynamically encode during self-motion remains unknown. Here we recorded the activity of individual anterior vermis Purkinje cells in alert monkeys during passively applied whole-body, body-under-head, and head-on-body rotations. Most neurons dynamically encoded an intermediate representation of self-motion between head and body motion. Notably, these neurons responded to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation and showed considerable heterogeneity in their response dynamics. Furthermore, their vestibular responses demonstrated tuning in response to changes in head-on-body position. In contrast, a small remaining percentage of neurons sensitive only to vestibular stimulation unambiguously encoded head-in-space motion across conditions. Using a simple population model, we establish that combining responses from 40 Purkinje cells can explain the responses of their target neurons in deep cerebellar nuclei across all self-motion conditions. We propose that the observed heterogeneity in Purkinje cells underlies the cerebellums capacity to compute the dynamic representation of body motion required to ensure accurate postural control and perceptual stability in our daily lives.",

While these processes have been studied on a population level, the individual cellular variability has remained unknown. Here, using a microfluidic device combined with time-lapse microscopy, we monitor invader clearance in a population of Escherichia coli across multiple generations. We observed that CRISPR interference is fast with a narrow distribution of clearance times. In contrast, for invaders with escaping PAM mutations we show large cell-to-cell variability of clearance times, which originates from primed CRISPR adaptation. Faster growth and cell division, as well as higher levels of Cascade, increase the chance of clearance by interference. In contrast, faster growth is associated with decreased chances of clearance by priming. A mathematical model explains the experimental findings, and identifies Cascade binding to the mutated invader DNA, rather than spacer integration, as the main source of priming heterogeneity. The highly stochastic nature of primed CRISPR adaptation implies that only subpopulations of bacteria are able to respond to invading threats in a timely manner. We conjecture that CRISPR-Cas dynamics and heterogeneity at the cellular level are crucial to understanding the strategy of bacteria in their competition with other species and phages.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The current paper proposes a method to estimate phase to phase cross-frequency coupling between brain areas, applied to broadband signals, without any a priori hypothesis about the frequency of the synchronized components. N:m synchronization is the only form of cross-frequency synchronization that allows the exchange of information at the time resolution of the faster signal, hence likely to play a fundamental role in large-scale coordination of brain activity. The proposed method, named cross-frequency phase linearity measurement (CF-PLM), builds and expands upon the phase linearity measurement, an iso-frequency connectivity metrics previously published by our group. The main idea lies in using the shape of the interferometric spectrum of the two analyzed signals in order to estimate the strength of cross-frequency coupling. Here, we demonstrate that the CF-PLM successfully retrieves the (different) frequencies of the original broad-band signals involved in the connectivity process. Furthermore, if the broadband signal has some frequency components that are synchronized in iso-frequency and some others that are synchronized in cross-frequency, our methodology can successfully disentangle them and describe the behaviour of each frequency component separately. We first provide a theoretical explanation of the metrics. Then, we test the proposed metric on simulated data from coupled oscillators synchronized in iso- and cross-frequency (using both Rossler and Kuramoto oscillator models), and subsequently apply it on real data from brain activity, using source-reconstructed Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. In the synthetic data, our results show reliable estimates even in the presence of noise and limited sample sizes. In the real signals, components synchronized in cross-frequency are retrieved, together with their oscillation frequencies. All in all, our method is useful to estimate n:m synchronization, based solely on the phase of the signals (independently of the amplitude), and no a-priori hypothesis is available about the expected frequencies. Our method can be exploited to more accurately describe patterns of cross-frequency synchronization and determine the central frequencies involved in the coupling.",

While optimality models have been successful in providing valuable insight into the evolution of a wide variety of biological traits, a common objection is that optimality models are overly simplistic and ignore organismal genetics. We revisit evolutionary optimization in the context of a major bacteriophage life history trait, lysis time. Lysis time refers to the period spanning phage infection of a host cell and its lysis, whereupon phage progeny are released. Lysis time, therefore, directly determines phage fecundity assuming progeny assembly rate is maximized. Noting that previous tests of lysis time optimality rely on batch culture, we implemented a quasi-continuous culture system to observe productivity of a panel of isogenic phage {lambda} mutants differing in lysis time. We report that {lambda} phage productivity in our experiments is maximized around an optimal lysis time of 63 min, which is the lysis time of the {lambda} \"wildtype\" strain. We discuss this finding in light of recent results that lysis time variation is also minimized in the {lambda} \"wildtype\" strain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Diatoms contribute as a dominant group of microalgae to approximately 20% of the global carbon fixation. In the plankton, these photosynthetic algae are exposed to a plethora of metabolites, especially when competing algae are lysed. It is well established that diatoms can take up specific metabolites, such as vitamins, amino acids as nitrogen source, or dimethylsulfoniopropoionate to compensate for changes in water salinity. It is, however, unclear to which extent diatoms take up other organic resources and if these are incorporated into the cells metabolism. Here, we ask about the general scope of uptake of metabolites from competitors. Using labeled metabolites released during lysis of algae grown under a 13CO2 atmosphere, we show that the cosmopolitan diatom Chaetoceros didymus takes up organic substrates with little bias and remarkable efficiency. The newly developed pulse label/ mass spectrometry metabolomics approach reveals that polarity and molecular weight has no detectable influence on uptake efficiency. We also reveal that the taken-up pool of metabolites is partly maintained unaltered within the cells but is also subject to catabolic and anabolic transformation. One of the most dominant phytoplankton groups is thus substantially competing with other heterotrophs for organic material, suggesting that the observed absorbotrophy may substantially impact organic material fluxes in the oceans. Our findings call for the refinement of our understanding of competition in the plankton.\n\nSignificanceThis study demonstrates a remarkably universal uptake of organic substrates by diatoms. The extent to which one of the most dominant phytoplankton groups is competing for organic material in the plankton is documented by novel pulse labeling metabolomics studies. Our results show that uptake of organic material by the photosynthetic microalgae occurs with remarkably little bias. Taken-up metabolites are further transformed by the diatoms or directly incorporated into the algal metabolome. Our study calls for a re-consideration of organic material fluxes in the oceans. Also, our understanding of competition in the plankton will have to be refined. The broader implications for the cycling of resources in plankton communities are discussed within this work.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The magnitude and efficiency of particulate carbon export from the ocean surface depends not only on net primary production (NPP) but also on how carbon is consumed, respired, and repackaged by organisms. We contend that several of these processes can be captured by the size spectrum of the plankton community. However, most global models have relatively simple food-web structures that are unable to generate plankton sizespectra. Moreover, the life-cycles of multicellular zooplankton are typically not resolved, restricting the ability of models to represent time-lags that are known to impact carbon export and its efficiency (pe-ratio). Here, we use a global mechanistic size-spectrum model of the marine plankton community to investigate how particulate export and pe-ratio relate to the community size spectrum, community composition, and time-lags between predators and prey. The model generates emergent food-webs with associated size distributions for organisms and detrital particles. To resolve time-lags between phytoplankton and zooplankton, we implement the life-cycle of multicellular zooplankton (here represented by copepods). The simulation successfully captures observed patterns in biomass and energy fluxes across regions. We find that carbon export correlates best with copepod biomass and trophic level, whereas the pe-ratio correlates best with the exponent of the size spectrum and sea surface temperature (SST). Community metrics performed better than NPP or SST for both deep export and pe-ratio. Time-lags between phytoplankton and copepods did not strongly affect export or pe-ratio. We conclude by discussing how can we reconcile size-spectrum theory with field sampling.\n\nPlain Language SummaryPlankton are tiny but extremely abundant aquatic organisms. Plankton lock CO2 away from the atmosphere as they sink to the deep ocean, where carbon can be stored for hundreds of years. However, how much carbon is locked away and for how long depends on how organisms eat, defecate, and respire. We argue that these processes are reflected in the size composition of the plankton community. The size composition shows a clear relationship between the number of organisms and their body-size. The steepness of this \"size-abundance relationship\" describes the balance between small vs. large organisms, and has been argued to reflect how energy is transferred from small to large organisms. Since large organisms create fast-sinking particles, the size-abundance relationship could be used to estimate how much carbon is being stored in the deep ocean. Here we use a computer simulation of the global plankton community to investigate how the removal of carbon relates to the plankton community and the steepness of the sizeabundance relationship. The model successfully captures patterns observed in nature. We found that the size-abundance relationship, together with the quantity of large zooplankton better explained carbon export than other measures typically used, such as photosynthesis and temperature.\n\nKey PointsO_LIWe use a global mechanistic size-spectrum model to investigate the relation between particulate export and plankton community metrics.\nC_LIO_LIWe find a good correlation between export efficiency and the exponent of the size spectrum.\nC_LIO_LITotal carbon export correlated well with copepod biomass and trophic level of active copepods in the model.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Metabolic profiling harbors the potential to better understand various disease entities such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, Parkinsons disease or COVID-19. Deciphering these intricate pathways in human studies requires large sample sizes as a means of reducing variability. While such broad human studies have discovered new associations between a given disease and certain affected metabolites, i.e. biomarkers, they often provide limited functional insights. To design more standardized experiments, reduce variability in the measurements and better resolve the functional component of such dynamic metabolic profiles, model organisms are frequently used. Standardized rearing conditions and uniform sampling strategies are prerequisites towards a successful metabolomic study. However, further aspects such as the choice of extraction protocol and analytical technique can influence the outcome drastically. Here, we employed a highly standardized metabolic profiling assay analyzing 630 metabolites across three commonly used model organisms (Drosophila, mouse and Zebrafish) to find the optimal extraction protocols for various matrices. Focusing on parameters such as metabolite coverage, metabolite yield and variance between replicates we compared seven extraction protocols. We found that the application of a combination of 75% ethanol and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), while not producing the broadest coverage and highest yields, was the most reproducible extraction protocol. We were able to determine up to 530 metabolites in mouse kidney samples, 509 in mouse liver, 422 in Zebrafish and 388 in Drosophila and discovered a core overlap of 261 metabolites in these four matrices. To enable other scientists to search for the most suitable extraction protocol in their experimental context and interact with this comprehensive data, we have integrated our data set in the open-source shiny app \"MetaboExtract\". This will enable scientists to search for their metabolite or metabolite class of interest, compare it across the different tested extraction protocols and sample types as well as find reference concentrations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "How environmental cues influence peroxisome proliferation, particularly through other organelles, remains largely unknown. Yeast peroxisomes metabolize all fatty acids (FA), and methylotrophic yeasts also metabolize methanol. NADH and acetyl-CoA, the products of these pathways enter mitochondria for ATP production, and for anabolic reactions. During the metabolism of FA and/or methanol, the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway accepts NADH for ATP production and maintains cellular redox balance. Remarkably, peroxisome proliferation in Pichia pastoris was abolished in NADH shuttling and OXPHOS mutants affecting complex I or III, or by the mitochondrial uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), indicating ATP depletion causes the phenotype. We show that mitochondrial OXPHOS deficiency inhibits the expression of several peroxisomal proteins implicated in FA and methanol metabolism, as well as in peroxisome division and proliferation. These genes are regulated by the Snf1 complex (SNF1), a pathway generally activated by high AMP and low ATP. Consistent with this mechanism, in OXPHOS mutants, Snf1 is activated by phosphorylation, but Gal83, its interacting subunit, fails to translocate to the nucleus. Phenotypic defects in peroxisome proliferation observed in the OXPHOS mutants, and phenocopied by the{Delta} gal83 mutant, were rescued by deletion of three transcriptional repressor genes (MIG1, MIG2 and NRG1) controlled by SNF1 signaling. We uncovered here the mechanism by which peroxisomal and mitochondrial metabolites influence redox and energy metabolism, while also influencing peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation, thereby exemplifying interorganellar communication and interplay involving peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol and the nucleus. We discuss the physiological relevance of this work in view of human OXPHOS deficiencies.",

Here we demonstrate that the shape of airinemes in zebrafish are consistent with a finite persistent random walk model. The probability of contacting the target cell is maximized for a balance between ballistic search (straight) and diffusive search (highly curved, random). We find that the curvature of airinemes in zebrafish, extracted from live cell microscopy, is approximately the same value as the optimum in the simple persistent random walk model. We also explore the ability of the target cell to infer direction of the airinemes source, finding that there is a theoretical trade-off between search optimality and directional information. This provides a framework to characterize the shape, and performance objectives, of non-canonical cellular protrusions in general.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Memory is used by animals to influence navigational decisions, and neural activity in memory-related brain regions correlates to spatial variables. However, navigation is a rich behavior that contains a mix of memory-guided and memory-independent strategies. Disentangling the contribution of these strategies to navigation is therefore critical for understanding how memory influences behavioral output. To address this issue, we studied the natural spatial behavior of the chickadee, a food-caching bird. These birds hide food items at concealed, scattered locations and retrieve their caches later in time. We designed an apparatus that allows chickadees to cache and retrieve food while navigating in a laboratory arena. This apparatus enabled detailed, automated, and high-throughput tracking of key behavioral variables - including caches, retrievals, and investigations of cache sites. We built probabilistic models to fit these behavioral data using a combination of various mnemonic and non-mnemonic factors. We find that chickadees use some navigational strategies that are independent of cache memories, including opportunistic foraging and spatial biases. They combine these strategies with spatially precise and long-lasting memories of which sites contain caches and which sites they have previously checked and found to be empty. These memories are used in a context-dependent manner. During caching, chickadees avoid sites that already contain food. During retrieval, they are instead attracted to such occupied sites. These results show that a single memory can be used flexibly by a chickadee to achieve at least two unrelated behavioral goals. Our apparatus enables studying this flexibility in a tractable spatial paradigm.",

Allele balance has been used to infer polyploidy and heterokaryosis in diverse organisms using read sets sequenced to greater than 50x whole-genome coverage. However, Sequencing to adequate depth is costly if applied to multiple individuals or large genomes.\n\nResultsWe developed VCFvariance.pl to utilize the variance of allele balance to infer polyploidy and/or heterokaryosis at low sequence coverage. This analysis requires as little as 10x whole-genome coverage and reduces the allele balance profile down to a single value, which can be used to determine if an individual has two or more haplotypes. This approach was validated on simulated, synthetic, and authentic read sets from an oomycete, fungus, and plant. The approach was deployed to ascertain the genome status of multiple isolates of Bremia lactucae and Phytophthora infestans.\n\nAvailability and implementationVCFvariance.pl is a Perl script available at https://github.com/kfletcher88/VCFvariance.",

Here, we characterized the DA1, DAR 1 and BB gene families in maize and analyzed whether perturbation of these genes regulates organ size similar to what was observed in Arabidopsis. We generated da1_dar1a_dar1b triple CRISPR maize mutants and bb1_bb2 double mutants. Detailed phenotypic analysis showed that the size of leaf, stem, cob, and seed was not consistently enlarged in these mutants. Also overexpression of a dominant-negative DA1R333K allele, resembling the da1-1 allele of Arabidopsis which has larger leaves and seeds, did not alter the maize phenotype. The mild negative effects on plant height of the DA1R333K_bb1_bb2 mutant indicate that the genes in the DA1 pathway may control organ size in maize, albeit less obvious than in Arabidopsis.",

This response can be recapitulated with purified mucin, the bulk component of mucus, but not by similarly-viscous methylcellulose or simple sugars.

Rai14-deficient neurons failed to maintain a proper dendritic spine density in the Rai14+/- mouse brain, resulting in impaired functional synaptic activity. Rai14 was protected from degradation by complex formation with Tara, and accumulated in the dendritic spine neck, thereby enhancing spine maintenance. Concurrently, Rai14 deficiency in mice altered gene expression profile relevant to depressive conditions and increased depressive-like behaviors.

In cancer histopathology, AI can be used to predict the presence of molecular alterations directly from routine histopathology slides. However, training robust AI systems requires large datasets whose collection faces practical, ethical and legal obstacles. These obstacles could be overcome with swarm learning (SL) where partners jointly train AI models, while avoiding data transfer and monopolistic data governance. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the successful use of SL in large, multicentric datasets of gigapixel histopathology images comprising over 5000 patients. We show that AI models trained using Swarm Learning can predict BRAF mutational status and microsatellite instability (MSI) directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathology slides of colorectal cancer (CRC). We trained AI models on three patient cohorts from Northern Ireland, Germany and the United States of America and validated the prediction performance in two independent datasets from the United Kingdom using SL-based AI models. Our data show that SL enables us to train AI models which outperform most locally trained models and perform on par with models which are centrally trained on the merged datasets. In addition, we show that SL-based AI models are data efficient and maintain a robust performance even if only subsets of local datasets are used for training. In the future, SL can be used to train distributed AI models for any histopathology image analysis tasks, overcoming the need for data transfer and without requiring institutions to give up control of the final AI model.",

These multi-subunit complexes consist of a cytoplasmic V1 region that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane-embedded VO region that transports protons. V-ATPase activity is regulated by reversible dissociation of the two regions, with the isolated V1 and VO complexes becoming autoinhibited upon disassembly and subunit C subsequently detaching from V1. In yeast, assembly of the V1 and VO regions is mediated by the RAVE complex through an unknown mechanism. We used cryoEM of yeast V-ATPase to determine structures of the intact enzyme, the dissociated but complete V1 complex, and the V1 complex lacking subunit C. Upon separation, V1 undergoes a dramatic conformational rearrangement, with its rotational state becoming incompatible for reassembly with VO. Loss of subunit C allows V1 to match the rotational state of VO, suggesting how RAVE could reassemble V1 and VO by recruiting subunit C.",

However, our understanding of the cellular crosstalk evoked at perivascular sites is still rudimentary. In this study, we identify intercellular machinery governing formation of a pro-metastatic vascular niche during breast cancer colonization in lungs. We show that four secreted factors, INHBB, SCGB3A1, OPG and LAMA1, induced in metastasis-associated endothelial cells (ECs), are essential components of the vascular niche and promote metastasis in mice by enhancing stem cell properties and survival ability of cancer cells. Notably, blocking VEGF, a key regulator of EC behavior, dramatically suppressed EC proliferation, whereas no impact was observed on the expression of the four vascular niche factors in lung ECs. However, perivascular macrophages, activated via the TNC-TLR4 axis, were shown to be crucial for EC-mediated production of niche components. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the formation of vascular niches in metastasis.",

Early bit-to-base transcoding schemes have primarily pursued information density, at the expense however of introducing biocompatibility challenges or at the risk of decoding failure. Here, we propose a robust transcoding algorithm named the \"Yin-Yang Codec\" (YYC), using two rules to encode two binary bits into one nucleotide, to generate DNA sequences highly compatible with synthesis and sequencing technologies. We encoded two representative file formats and stored them in vitro as 200-nt oligo pools and in vivo as an ~54-kb DNA fragment in yeast cells. Sequencing results show that YYC exhibits high robustness and reliability for a wide variety of data types, with an average recovery rate of 99.94% at 104 molecule copies and an achieved recovery rate of 87.53% at 100 copies. In addition, the in vivo storage demonstration achieved for the first time an experimentally measured physical information density of 198.8 EB per gram of DNA (44% of the theoretical maximum for DNA).",

    "preprint_abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor that frequently exhibits gain of chromosome 7, loss of chromosome 10 and aberrantly activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Here, we identify mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2) on chromosome 7 with increased expression in GBM as a salient oncogenic transcription factor. Specifically, we show that MEOX2 overexpression leads to increased ERK phosphorylation, and we identify a phosphorylation site on MEOX2 that regulates its transcriptional activity by altering its subnuclear localization. We show that MEOX2 overexpression can lead to increased growth in GBM implantation models and cooperates with loss of p53 and PTEN in cerebral organoid models of human malignant gliomas to induce cell proliferation. Furthermore, using high-throughput genomics, we identify transcriptional target genes of MEOX2 in patient-derived GBM tumorsphere models and a fresh frozen GBM tumor. These analyses show that MEOX2 activates several oncogenic pathways involved in MAPK signaling and extracellular matrix organization. Furthermore, MEOX2 binds to oncogenic ETS factors and known glioma oncogenes such as FABP7. In total, we reveal a novel role for MEOX2 in GBM initiation and progression and demonstrate that MEOX2 can enhance ERK signaling through a feed-forward mechanism.\n\nSignificance StatementGlioblastoma (GBM) harbors gain of chromosome 7 as an early driver event. In this study, we show that mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2), an aberrantly upregulated transcription factor on chromosome 7, is an oncogene in human glioblastoma. In contrast to GBM, MEOX2 expression is very low in normal brain. We show that MEOX2 cooperates with p53 and PTEN loss to promote tumor initiation in cerebral organoid models. In addition, we identify direct and indirect molecular targets of MEOX2 and demonstrate its role in activating the ERK signaling cascade. These findings identify a novel oncogene in GBM and highlight the transcriptional networks hijacked by these tumors to activate signaling pathways central to GBM biology.",

Recent studies show that propofol, a widely used anesthetic, dramatically alters cortical oscillations by increasing slow-delta oscillatory power and coherence. It is not known how this affects traveling waves. We compared traveling waves across the cortex of non-human primates (NHPs) before, during, and after propofol-induced loss-of-consciousness (LOC). After LOC, traveling waves in the slow-delta ([~] 1Hz) range increased, grew more organized, and travelled in different directions relative to the awake state. Higher frequency (8-30 Hz) traveling waves, by contrast, decreased, lost structure, and switched to directions where the slow-delta waves were less frequent. The results suggest that LOC may be due, in part, to changes in slow-delta traveling waves that, in turn, alter and disrupt traveling waves in the higher frequencies associated with cognition.",

Yet, most prior research has exclusively investigated spatial representations on a flat surface, leaving a 2D cognitive map as the dominant model in the field. Here, we investigated whether humans represent a curved surface by building a dimension-reduced flattened 2D map or a full 3D map. Participants learned the location of objects positioned on a flat and curved surface in a virtual environment by driving on the concave side of the surface (Experiment 1), driving and looking vertically (Experiment 2), or flying (Experiment 3). Subsequently, they were asked to retrieve either the path distance or the 3D Euclidean distance between the objects. Path distance estimation was good overall, but we found a significant underestimation bias for the path distance on the curve, suggesting an influence of potential 3D shortcuts, even though participants were only driving on the surface. Euclidean distance estimation was better when participants were exposed more to the global 3D structure of the environment by looking and flying. These results suggest that the representation of the 2D manifold, embedded in a 3D world, is neither purely 2D nor 3D. Rather, it is flexible and dependent on the behavioral experience and demand.",

Phylum Porifera is an early branching group of metazoans essential to understanding the key mechanisms of tissue homeostasis. This paper is dedicated to the comparative analysis of proliferation and apoptosis in intact tissues of two sponges belonging to distinct Porifera lineages, Halisarca dujardinii (class Demospongiae) and Leucosolenia variabilis (class Calcarea).\n\nResultsLabeled nucleotides EdU and anti-phosphorylated histone 3 antibodies reveal a considerable number of cycling cells in intact tissues of both species. The main type of cycling cells are choanocytes - flagellated cells of the aquiferous system. The rate of proliferation remains constant in areas containing choanoderm. Cell cycle distribution assessed by the quantitative DNA stain reveals the classic cell cycle distribution curve. During EdU pulse-chase experiments conducted in H. dujardinii, the contribution of the choanocytes to the total amount of EdU-positive cells decreases, while contribution of the mesohyl cells increases. These findings could indicate that the proliferation of the choanocytes is not solely limited to the renewal of the choanoderm, and that choanocytes may participate in the general cell turnover through migration. The number of apoptotic cells in intact tissues of both species is insignificant. In vivo studies in both species with TMRE and CellEvent Caspase-3/7 indicate that apoptosis might be independent of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.\n\nConclusionsA combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry provides a quantitative description of cell turnover in intact sponge tissues. Intact tissues of H. dujardinii (Demospongiae) and L. variabilis (Calcarea) are highly proliferative, indicating either high rates of growth or cell turnover. Although the number of apoptotic cells is low, apoptosis could still be involved in the regular cell turnover.",

We investigated whether adiposity-associated genes and gene co-expression networks in outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats overlap those found in humans. We analyzed RNAseq data from adipose tissue of 415 male HS rats, correlated these transcripts with body weight (BW) and compared transcriptome signatures to two human cohorts: the African American Genetics of Metabolism and Expression and Metabolic Syndrome in Men. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify adiposity-associated gene networks and mediation analysis to identify genes under genetic control whose expression drives adiposity. We identified 554 orthologous \"consensus genes\" whose expression correlates with BW in the rat and with body mass index (BMI) in both human cohorts. Consensus genes fell within eight co-expressed networks and were enriched for genes involved in immune system function, cell growth, extracellular matrix organization and lipid metabolic processes. We identified 19 consensus genes for which genetic variation may influence BW via their expression, including those involved in lipolysis (e.g., Hcar1), inflammation (e.g., Rgs1), adipogenesis (e.g., Tmem120b) or no previously known role in obesity (e.g., St14, Msa4a6).

This article uses the Aggrescan3D (A3D) tool to compute the structure-based aggregation predictions for the human proteome and make the predictions available in a database form.\n\nResultsHere, we present the A3D Database, in which we analyze the AF-predicted human protein structures (for over 17 thousand non-membrane proteins) in terms of their aggregation properties using the A3D tool. Each entry of the A3D Database provides a detailed analysis of the structure-based aggregation propensity computed with A3D. The A3D Database implements simple but useful graphical tools for visualizing and interpreting protein structure datasets. We discuss case studies illustrating how the database could be used to analyze physiologically relevant proteins. Furthermore, the database enables testing the influence of user-selected mutations on protein solubility and stability, all integrated into a user-friendly interface.\n\nAvailability and implementationA3D Database is freely available at: http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D2/hproteome",

Associations between externalizing or internalizing behaviors and cortico-amygdalar connectivity have been found in children with and without clinically significant internalizing/externalizing behaviors. This study examined whether such associations are present across children with different NDDs.\n\nMethodsMulti-modal neuroimaging and behavioral data from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network were used. POND participants aged 6-18 years with a primary diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as typically developing children (TDC) with T1-weighted, resting-state fMRI or diffusion weighted imaging and parent-report Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) data available, were analyzed (n range=157-346). Associations between externalizing or internalizing behavior and cortico-amygdalar structural and functional connectivity indices were examined using linear regressions, controlling for age, gender, and image-modality specific covariates. Behavior-by-diagnosis interaction effects were also examined.\n\nResultsNo significant linear associations (or diagnosis-by-behavior interaction effects) were found between CBCL-measured externalizing or internalizing behaviors and any of the connectivity indices examined. Post-hoc bootstrapping analyses indicated stability and reliability of these null results.\n\nConclusionsThe current study provides evidence in favour of the absence of a shared linear relationship between internalizing or externalizing behaviors and cortico-amygdalar connectivity properties across a transdiagnostic sample of children with various NDDs and TDC. Detecting shared brain-behavior relationships in children with NDDs may benefit from the use of different methodological approaches, including incorporation of multi-dimensional behavioral data (i.e. behavioral assessments, neurocognitive tasks, task-based fMRI) or clustering approaches to delineate whether subgroups of individuals with different brain-behavior profiles are present within heterogeneous cross-disorder samples.",

We discovered that orally administered methylphenidate, used clinically to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and generally to enhance cognition (Lakhan & Kirchgessner, 2012; Maher, 2008), increases spatially selective visual attention, enhancing visual performance at only the attended location. And as predicted by our previous work (Ni et al., 2018), we found that this causal manipulation enhances vision in rhesus macaques specifically when it decreases the mean correlated variability of neurons in visual area V4. Our findings demonstrate that the visual system is a platform for understanding the neural underpinnings of both complex cognitive processes (basic science) and neuropsychiatric disorders (translation). Addressing basic science hypotheses, our results are consistent with a scenario in which methylphenidate has cognitively specific effects by working through naturally selective cognitive mechanisms. Clinically, our findings suggest that the often staggeringly specific symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders may be caused and treated by leveraging general mechanisms.",

    "preprint_abstract": "How larvae of the many phyla of marine invertebrates find places appropriate for settlement, metamorphosis, growth and reproduction is an enduring question in marine science. Biofilm induced metamorphosis has been observed in marine invertebrate larvae from nearly every major marine phylum. Despite the widespread nature of this phenomenon the mechanism of induction remains poorly understood. The serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans is a well-established model for investigating bacteria-induced larval development. A broad range of biofilm bacterial species elicit larval metamorphosis in H. elegans via at least two mechanisms, including outer membrane vesicles and phage-tail bacteriocins. We investigated the interaction between larvae of H. elegans and the inductive bacterium Cellulophaga lytica, which produces an abundance of OMVs but not phage-tail bacteriocins. We asked whether the OMVs of C. lytica induce larval settlement due to cell membrane components or through delivery of specific cargo. Employing a biochemical structure-function approach with a strong ecological focus, the cells and outer membrane vesicles produced by C. lytica were interrogated to determine the nature of the inductive molecule. Here we report that the cue produced by C. lytica that induces larvae of H. elegans to metamorphose is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The widespread prevalence of LPS and its associated taxonomic and structural variability suggest it may be a broadly employed cue for bacterially induced larval settlement of marine invertebrates.\n\nSignificance StatementNew surfaces in the sea are quickly populated by dense communities of invertebrate animals, whose establishment and maintenance require site-specific settlement of larvae from the plankton. Although it is recognized that larvae selectively settle in sites where they can metamorphose and thrive, and that the biofilm bacteria residing on these surfaces supply inductive cues, the nature of the cues used to identify  right places has remained enigmatic. In this paper, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the outer membrane of a marine Gram-negative bacterium cue metamorphosis for a marine worm and discuss the likelihood that LPS provides the variation necessary to explain settlement site selectivity for many of the bottom-living invertebrate animals that metamorphose in response to bacterial biofilms.",

In this context, ABA-induced antioxidant defence is considered to be a main mechanism to that enhances water stress tolerance in plants. The specific details of this activation remain, however, elusive. In this work, we show that DIP1, a protein from novel R3H family, played a central role in modulating water stress tolerance in rice. OsDIP1 transcripts were induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ABA, drought (polyethylene glycol treatment), and salt stress. Overexpression of OsDIP1 in rice enhanced drought and salinity tolerance while knocking out OsDIP1 by CRISPR-Cas9 editing resulted in drought and salt sensitive phenotype. The activity and gene expression of antioxidant defence enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), increased in OsDIP1-overexpressed transgenic rice plants, while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased. In contrast, the content and gene expression of SOD and CAT, decreased, and the content of MDA increased in knockout of OsDIP1 rice plants, suggesting that overexpression of OsDIP1 enhances the antioxidant capacity of rice plants. The yeast two hybrid screening test revealed that OsDIP1 interacted with ZFP36, a key zinc finger transcription factor involved in ABA-induced antioxidant defence. Moreover, OsDIP1 could modulate some key ABA-responsive genes via interacting with ZFP36. Overall, our findings indicate an important role of OsDIP1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence signaling and adaptation to salinity and drought in rice.",

Measuring the mechanical properties of cytoskeletal structures is crucial for gaining insight into intracellular mechanical stresses and their role in regulating cellular processes. One of the ways to characterize these mechanical properties is by measuring their persistence length, the average length over which filaments stay straight. There are several approaches in the literature for measuring filament deformations, including Fourier analysis of images obtained using fluorescence microscopy. Here, we show how curvature distributions can be used as an alternative tool to quantify bio-filament deformations, and investigate how the apparent stiffness of filaments depends on the resolution and noise of the imaging system. We present analytical calculations of the scaling curvature distributions as a function of filament discretization, and test our predictions by comparing Monte Carlo simulations to results from existing techniques. We also apply our approach to microtubules and actin filaments obtained from in vitro gliding assay experiments with high densities of non-functional motors, and calculate the persistence length of these filaments. The presented curvature analysis is significantly more accurate compared to existing approaches for small data sets, and can be readily applied to both in vitro or in vivo filament data through the use of an ImageJ plugin we provide.",

Although, clinical immunity develops over time with repeated malaria episodes, disease tolerance is more rapidly acquired compared to protective immunity. It remains unclear, how pre-existing immune responses impacts the mechanism responsible for disease tolerance. Here, we investigated a cohort of returning travelers treated for acute symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, either infected for the first time, or with a previous history of malaria. Through repeated sampling over one year in a malaria free setting, we were able to study the acute and longitudinal effects of the infection. We combined comprehensive immune cell and plasma protein profiling with integrated and data driven analysis, describing the immune landscape from acute disease to one year after infection. We identified a strong association between pro-inflammatory signatures and {gamma}{delta} T cell expansion. The association was significantly impacted by previous exposure to malaria, resulting in a dampened pro-inflammatory response, which translated to reduced V{delta}2+ {gamma}{delta} T cell expansion compared to primary infected individuals. The dampened inflammatory signal was associated with early expansion of Fc{gamma}RIII+ monocytes and parasite-specific antibodies of IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes.\n\nOur data suggest that the interplay of Fc{gamma}RIII+ monocytes and a cytophilic parasite-specific IgG during the early blood stage infection lead to lower parasitemia and a dampened pro-inflammatory response with reduced {gamma}{delta} T cell expansion. This enhanced control and reduced inflammation points to a potential mechanism on how tolerance is established following repeated malaria exposure.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA systems immunology analysis on natural malaria sheds light on disease tolerance mechanism associated with gamma delta T cell expansion",

Here we show that in vitro cytokine treatment leads to the development of a subgroup of human PMN expressing CCR5, termed CCR5+ cytokine-induced PMN (CCR5+ cPMN). Auto/paracrine TNF signaling increases intracellular neutrophil elastase (ELANE) abundance and induces NETosis in CCR5+ cPMN. Triggering of CCR5 amplifies NETosis. Membranous TNF (mTNF) outside-in signaling induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, a known activator of NETosis. In vivo, we find an increased number of CCR5+ cPMN in the peripheral blood and inflamed lamina propria of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) but not Crohns disease (CD). Notably, failure of anti-TNF therapy is associated with higher frequencies of CCR5+ cPMN. In conclusion, we identify a phenotype of pro-NETotic, CCR5 positive PMN present in inflamed tissue in vivo and inducible in vitro.

Here we identify such factors in the context of spatial alternation in rats, a task often described as relying solely on memory of past choices. We combine hypothesis-driven behavioral design and reinforcement learning modeling to identify spatial preferences that, when combined with memory, support learning of a spatial alternation task. Identifying these preferences allows us to capture differences among animals, including differences in overall learning ability. Our results show that to understand the complexity of behavior requires quantitative accounts of the preferences of each animal.",

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for GABAergic signaling remain unclear, as SNcDA neurons lack enzymes typically required to produce GABA or package it into synaptic vesicles. Here we show that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1), an enzyme proposed to function as a GABA synthetic enzyme in SNcDA neurons does not produce GABA for synaptic transmission. Instead, we demonstrate that SNcDA axons obtain GABA exclusively through presynaptic uptake using the membrane GABA transporter Gat1 (encoded by Slc6a1). GABA is then packaged for vesicular release using the vesicular monoamine transporter Vmat2. Our data therefore show that presynaptic transmitter recycling can substitute for de novo GABA synthesis and that Vmat2 contributes to vesicular GABA transport, expanding the range of molecular mechanisms available to neurons to support inhibitory synaptic communication.",

Since the frequency of curated coding sequences is many-folds as compared to that of the ncRNAs, we devised a novel approach to work with the complete datasets from fifteen diverse species. In our proposed novel binary approach, we replaced all the  As and  Ts with  0s and  Gs and  Cs with  1s to obtain a binary form of coding and ncRNAs. The k-mer analysis of these binary sequences revealed that the frequency of binary patterns among the coding and ncRNAs can be used as features to distinguish among them. Using insights from these distinguishing frequencies, we used k-nearest neighbour classifier to classify among them. Our strategy is not only time-efficient but leads to significantly increased performance metrics including Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for some species like P. paniscus, M. mulatta, M. lucifugus, G. gallus, C. japonica, C. abingdonii, A. carolinensis, D. melanogaster and C. elegans when compared with the conventional ATGC approach. Additionally, we also show that the values of MCC obtained for diverse species tested on the model based on H. sapiens correlated with the geological evolutionary timeline thereby further strengthening our approach. Therefore, we propose that CDS and ncRNAs can be efficiently classified using \"2-character\" frequency as compared to \"4-character\" frequency of ATGC approach. Thus, our highly efficient binary approach can replace the more complex ATGC approach successfully.",

In the last decade, advancements in neuroimaging technologies for infants are starting to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms supporting this important learning period. The current study reports on the largest longitudinal dataset to date with the aim to replicate and extend on two important questions: 1) what are the developmental changes during the  sensitive period for native and nonnative speech processing? 2) how does native and nonnative speech processing in infants predict later language outcomes? Fifty-four infants were recruited at 7 months of age and their neural processing of speech was measured using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Specifically, the neural sensitivity to a native and a nonnative speech contrast was indexed by the mismatch response (MMR). They repeated the measurement again at 11 months of age and their language development was further tracked from 12 months to 30 months of age using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI). Using an a prior Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach, we observed significant increases for the Native MMR in the left inferior frontal region (IF) and superior temporal region (ST) from 7 to 11 months, but not for the Nonnative MMR. Complementary whole brain comparison revealed more widespread developmental changes for both contrasts. However, only individual differences in the left IF and ST for the Nonnative MMR at 11 months of age were significant predictors of individual vocabulary growth up to 30 months of age. An exploratory machine-learning based analysis further revealed that whole brain MMR for both Native and Nonnative contrasts can robustly predict later outcomes, but with very different underlying spatial-temporal patterns. The current study extends our current knowledge and suggests that native and nonnative speech processing may follow different developmental trajectories and utilize different mechanisms that are relevant for later language skills.",

This work identifies and analyses the main cell regulatory processes affected and induced by SARS-CoV-2, using transcriptomic data from several infectable cell lines available in public databases and in vivo samples. We propose a new class of statistical models to handle three major challenges, namely the scarcity of observations, the high dimensionality of the data, and the complexity of the interactions between genes.

Additionally, a comparative analysis of these processes is performed to identify potential pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19. These are further compared to those identified by other authors for the same virus as well as related ones such as SARS-CoV-1.

Using a within-subjects (N = 30), crossover design, we assessed behavioural and electrophysiological indices of episodic encoding after a night of sleep or total sleep deprivation in healthy adults (aged 18-25 years), and investigated whether behavioural performance was predicted by the overnight consolidation of episodic associations formed the previous day. Sleep supported memory consolidation and next-day learning, as compared to sleep deprivation. However, the magnitude of this sleep-associated consolidation benefit did not significantly predict the ability to form novel memories after sleep. Interestingly, sleep deprivation prompted a qualitative change in the neural signature of encoding: whereas 12-20 Hz beta desynchronization - an established marker of successful encoding - was observed after sleep, sleep deprivation disrupted beta desynchrony during successful learning. Taken together, these findings suggest that effective learning depends on sleep, but not necessarily sleep-associated consolidation.",

Recently, it was shown that, when making perceptual judgements about stimuli containing high levels of  absolute evidence (i.e., the overall magnitude of sensory evidence across choice options), people make less accurate decisions and are also slower to change their mind and correct their mistakes. Here we report two studies that investigated whether high levels of absolute evidence also lead to increased decision confidence. We used a luminance judgment task in which participants decided which of two dynamic, flickering stimuli was brighter. After making a decision, participants rated their confidence. We manipulated relative evidence (i.e., the mean luminance difference between the two stimuli) and absolute evidence (i.e., the summed luminance of the two stimuli). In the first experiment, we found that higher absolute evidence was associated with decreased decision accuracy but increased decision confidence. In the second experiment, we additionally manipulated the degree of luminance variability to assess whether the observed effects were due to differences in perceived evidence variability. We replicated the results of the first experiment but did not find substantial effects of luminance variability on confidence ratings. Our findings support the view that decisions and confidence judgments are based on partly dissociable sources of information, and suggest that decisions initially made with higher confidence may be more resistant to subsequent changes of mind.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Meaningful changes in context create \"event boundaries\", segmenting continuous experience into distinct episodes in memory. A foundational finding in this literature is that event boundaries impair memory for the temporal order of stimuli spanning a boundary compared to equally spaced stimuli within an event. This seems surprising in light of intuitions about memory in everyday life, where the order of within-event experiences (did I have coffee before the first bite of bagel?) often seems more difficult to recall than the order of events per se (did I have breakfast or do the dishes first?). Here, we aimed to resolve this discrepancy by manipulating whether stimuli carried information about their encoding context during retrieval, as they often do in everyday life (e.g., bagel-breakfast). In Experiments 1 and 2, we show that stimuli inherently associated with a unique encoding context produce a \"flipped\" order memory effect, whereby temporal memory was superior for cross-boundary than within-event item pairs. In Experiments 3 and 4, we added context information at retrieval to a standard laboratory event memory protocol where stimuli were encoded in the presence of arbitrary context cues (colored frames). We found that whether temporal order memory for cross-boundary stimuli was enhanced or impaired relative to within-event items depended on whether the context was present or absent during the memory test. Taken together, we demonstrate that the effect of event boundaries on temporal memory is malleable, and determined by the availability of context information at retrieval.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundCochlear implantation is an effective auditory rehabilitation strategy for those with profound hearing loss, including those with residual low frequency hearing through use of hybrid cochlear implantation techniques. Post-mortem studies demonstrate the nearly ubiquitous presence of intracochlear fibrosis and neo-ossification following cochlear implantation. Current evidence suggests post-implantation intracochlear fibrosis is associated with delayed loss of residual acoustic hearing in hybrid cochlear implant (CI) recipients and may also negatively influence outcomes in traditional CI recipients. This study examined the contributions of surgical trauma, foreign body response and electric stimulation to intracochlear fibrosis and the innate immune response to cochlear implantation and the hierarchy of these contributions.\n\nMethodsNormal hearing CX3CR1+/GFP mice underwent either round window opening (sham), acute CI insertion or chronic CI insertion with no, low- or high-level electric stimulation. Electric stimulation levels were based on neural response telemetry (NRT), beginning post-operative day 7 for 4 hours per day. Subjects (n=3 per timepoint) were sacrificed at 4 hours, 1,4,7,8,11,14 and 21 days. An unimplanted group (n=3) served as controls. Cochleae were harvested at each time-point and prepared for immunohistochemistry with confocal imaging. The images were analyzed to obtain CX3CR1+ macrophage cell number and density in the lateral wall (LW), scala tympani (ST) and Rosenthals canal (RC).\n\nResultsA ST peri-implant cellular infiltrate and fibrosis occurred exclusively in the chronically implanted groups starting on day 7 with a concurrent infiltration of CX3CR1+ macrophages not seen in the other groups. CX3CR1+ macrophage infiltration was seen in the LW and RC in all experimental groups within the first week, being most prominent in the 3 chronically implanted groups during the second and third week. There were no significant differences in macrophage infiltration related to levels of electric stimulation.\n\nConclusionsThe cochlear immune response was most prominent in the presence of chronic cochlear implantation, regardless of electric stimulation level. Further, the development of intracochlear ST fibrosis was dependent on the presence of the indwelling CI foreign body. An innate immune response was evoked by surgical trauma alone (sham and acute CI groups) to a lesser degree. These data suggest that cochlear inflammation and intrascalar fibrosis after cochlear implantation are largely dependent on the presence of a chronic indwelling foreign body and are not critically dependent on electrical stimulation. Also, these data support a role for surgical trauma in inciting the initial innate immune response.",

Gradients and patterns of chemoattractants are well-described guides of multicellular organization, but the influences of three-dimensional geometry of soft hydrogels on multicellular organization are less well defined. Here, we report the discovery of a new mode of self-organization of endothelial cells in ring-like patterns on the perimeters of hydrogel microwells that is independent of protein or chemical patterning and is driven only by geometry and substrate stiffness. We observe quantitatively striking influences of both the microwell aspect ratio ({varepsilon} = perimeter/depth) and the hydrogel modulus. We systematically investigate the physical factors of cells and substrates that drive this multicellular behavior and present a mathematical model that explains the multicellular organization based upon balancing extracellular and cytoskeletal forces. These forces are determined in part by substrate stiffness, geometry, and cell density. The force balance model predicts the direction and distance of translational cell migration based on the dynamic interaction between tangential cytoskeletal tension and cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion. We further show that the experimental observations can be leveraged to drive customized multicellular self-organization. Our observation of this multicellular behavior demonstrates the importance of the combinatorial effects of geometry and stiffness in complex biological processes. It also provides a new methodology for direction of cell organization that may facilitate the engineering of bionics and integrated model organoid systems.",

In the era of  diabesity and due to its central role for metabolic and endocrine processes, adipose tissue (specifically white adipose tissue; WAT) has become a target of high interest for therapeutic strategies. To gain insights in cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipose (patho-)physiology, researchers traditionally relied on animal models since in vitro studies on human WAT are challenging due to the large size, buoyancy, and fragility of mature white adipocytes. Leveraging the Organ-on-Chip technology, we introduce a next-generation microphysiological in vitro model of human WAT based on a tailored microfluidic platform featuring vasculature-like perfusion. The platform integrates a 3D tissue comprising all major WAT-associated cellular components in an autologous manner, including not only mature adipocytes but also organotypic endothelial barriers and stromovascular cells featuring tissue-resident innate immune cells, specifically adipose tissue macrophages. This microphysiological tissue model recapitulates pivotal WAT functions, such as energy storage and mobilization as well as endocrine and immunomodulatory activities. The combination of all individual cell types with extra cellular matrix-like hydrogels in a precisely controllable bottom-up approach enables the generation of a multitude of replicates from the same donors circumventing issues of inter-donor variability and paving the way for personalized medicine. Moreover, it allows to adjust the models degree of complexity to fit a specific purpose via a flexible mix- and-match approach with different cell component modules. This novel WAT-on-chip system constitutes a human-based, autologous and immunocompetent in vitro model of adipose tissue that recapitulates almost full tissue heterogeneity. In the future, the new WAT-on-chip model can become a powerful tool for human-relevant research in the field of metabolism and its associated diseases as well as for compound testing and personalized- and precision medicine applications.",

We leveraged the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a scalable and tractable model to collect precise growth measurements of thousands of individuals, measure feeding behavior, and quantify changes in animal size and shape during a densely sampled developmental time course. As animals transitioned from one developmental stage to the next, we observed changes in body aspect ratio while body volume remained constant. Then, we modeled a physical mechanism by which constraints on cuticle stretch could cause changes in C. elegans body shape. The model-predicted shape changes are consistent with those observed in the data.

Yet for a growing number of research questions, loosening these rigorous restrictions would be beneficial. Among these is research on visual aesthetic experiences, which often involve open-ended exploration of highly variable stimuli. Here we systematically compare the effect of conservative vs. more liberal experimental settings on various measures of behavior, brain activity and physiology in an aesthetic rating task. Our primary aim was to assess EEG signal quality. 43 participants either maintained fixation or were allowed to gaze freely, and viewed either static images or dynamic (video) stimuli consisting of dance performances or nature scenes. A passive auditory background task (auditory steady-state response; ASSR) was added as a proxy measure for overall EEG recording quality. We recorded EEG, ECG and eyetracking data, and participants rated their aesthetic preference and state of boredom on each trial. Whereas both behavioral ratings and gaze behavior were affected by task and stimulus manipulations, EEG SNR was barely affected and generally robust across all conditions, despite only minimal preprocessing and no trial rejection. In particular, we show that using video stimuli does not necessarily result in lower EEG quality and can, on the contrary, significantly reduce eye movements while increasing both the participants aesthetic response and general task engagement. We see these as encouraging results indicating that - at least in the lab - more liberal experimental conditions can be adopted without significant loss of signal quality.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe assess trade-offs between EEG quality and behavior for common task constraints\nC_LIO_LIInvestigated constraints: fixation task vs. free gaze, and video vs. static stimuli\nC_LIO_LIMeasures: EEG quality, aesthetic preference, task engagement, gaze and heart rate\nC_LIO_LIVideo stimuli reduce eye movements, increase engagement and do not affect EEG SNR\nC_LIO_LIFixation task only slightly increases SNR and does not influence ratings\nC_LI",

Past neuroimaging investigations have revealed that both compounds can elicit significant changes to whole-brain functional organization and dynamics. A recent proposal linked past findings into a unified model and hypothesized reduced whole-brain hierarchical organization as a key mechanism underlying the psychedelic state, but this has yet to be directly tested. We applied a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique previously used to map hierarchical connectivity gradients to pharmacological resting-state fMRI data to assess cortical organization in the LSD and psilocybin state. Results supported our primary hypothesis: The principal gradient of cortical connectivity, describing a hierarchy from unimodal to transmodal cortex, was significantly flattened under both drugs relative to their respective placebo conditions. Between-condition contrasts revealed that this was driven by a reduction of functional differentiation at both hierarchical extremes - default and frontoparietal networks at the upper end, and somatomotor at the lower. Gradient-based connectivity mapping confirmed that this was underpinned by increased unimodal-transmodal crosstalk. In addition, LSD-dependent principal gradient changes tracked changes in self-reported ego-dissolution. Results involving the second and third gradient, which respectively represent axes of sensory and executive differentiation, also showed significant alterations across both drugs. These findings provide support for a recent mechanistic model of the psychedelic state relevant to therapeutic applications of psychedelics. More fundamentally, we provide the first evidence that macroscale connectivity gradients are sensitive to a pharmacological manipulation, specifically highlighting an important relationship between cortical organization and serotonergic modulation.",

In the context of such uncertainties, models of disease transmission can provide critical insight for optimizing pathogen management, especially for species of conservation concern. The endangered Florida panther experienced an outbreak of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in 2002-04, and continues to be affected by this deadly virus. Ongoing management efforts aim to mitigate the effects of FeLV on panthers, but with limited information about which strategies may be most effective and efficient.\nC_LIO_LIWe used a simulation-based approach to determine optimal FeLV management strategies in panthers. We simulated use of proactive FeLV management strategies (i.e., proactive vaccination) and several reactive strategies, including reactive vaccination and test-and-removal. Vaccination strategies accounted for imperfect vaccine-induced immunity, specifically partial immunity in which all vaccinates achieve partial pathogen protection. We compared the effectiveness of these different strategies in mitigating the number of FeLV mortalities and the duration of outbreaks.\nC_LIO_LIResults showed that inadequate proactive vaccination can paradoxically increase the number of disease-induced mortalities in FeLV outbreaks. These effects were most likely due to imperfect vaccine immunity causing vaccinates to serve as a semi-susceptible population, thereby allowing outbreaks to persist in circumstances otherwise conducive to fadeout. Combinations of proactive vaccination with reactive test-and-removal or vaccination, however, had a synergistic effect in reducing impacts of FeLV outbreaks, highlighting the importance of using mixed strategies in pathogen management.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications: Management-informed disease simulations are an important tool for identifying unexpected negative consequences and synergies among pathogen management strategies. In particular, we find that imperfect vaccine-induced immunity necessitates further consideration to avoid unintentionally worsening epidemics in some conditions.

During early embryonic and larval development, we find that histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all recognizable using microCT. Importantly, our approach is validated by the fact that the profile of CT values displayed here in the bitterling brain are consistent with genoarchitecture identified in previous studies.

Our previous studies have shown that adult male, but not female rats demonstrate social anxiety-like alterations and enhanced sensitivity to ethanol-induced social facilitation following adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. These consequences of AIE may influence adult social drinking in a sex-specific manner.\n\nMethodsTo test effects of AIE on social drinking, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to water or ethanol [0 or 4 g/kg, intragastrically, every other day, between postnatal day (P) 25 and 45] were tested as adults (P72-83) in a social drinking paradigm (30-minute access to a 10% ethanol solution in supersac or supersac alone in groups of three same-sex littermates across two 4-day cycles separated by 4 days off). Social behavior was assessed during the last drinking session, with further assessment of oxytocin (OXT), oxytocin receptor (OXTR), vasopressin (AVP) and vasopressin receptors 1a and 1b (AVPR1a, AVPR1b) in the hypothalamus and lateral septum.\n\nResultsMales exposed to AIE consumed more ethanol than water-exposed controls during the second drinking cycle, whereas AIE did not affect supersac intake in males. AIE-exposed females consumed less ethanol and more supersac than water-exposed controls. Water-exposed females drinking ethanol showed more social investigation as well as significantly higher hypothalamic OXTR, AVP, and AVPR1b gene expression than their counterparts ingesting supersac and AIE females drinking ethanol. In males, hypothalamic AVPR1b gene expression was affected by drinking solution, with significantly higher expression evident in males drinking ethanol than those consuming supersac.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, these findings provide new evidence regarding sex-specific effects of AIE on social drinking and suggest that the hypothalamic OXT and AVP systems are implicated in the effects of ingested ethanol on social behavior in a sex- and adolescent exposure-dependent manner.",

The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF was increased 24h post-injection in rats with an alcohol self-administration history but this effect did not persist after four injections, suggesting molecular tolerance. In both males and females, ethanol consumption was increased 24 h after imiquimod injections with sex-specific differences: in females this effect emerged following the first injection but in males this increase did not occur until the third injection, suggesting sex differences in adaptation to repeated TLR7 activation. Notably, imiquimod reliably induced weight loss, indicating that sickness behavior persisted across repeated injections.\n\nConclusionThese findings show that TLR7 activation can modulate alcohol drinking in an operant self-administration paradigm, and suggest that TLR7 and IRF7 signaling pathways may be a viable druggable target for treatment of AUD.",

We investigated the role of pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms (PKM1/2) in naive, formative, and primed mouse embryonic stem cells through modulation of PKM1/2 mRNA transcripts using steric blocking morpholinos that downregulate PKM2 and upregulate PKM1. We have examined these effects in naive, formative, and primed cells by quantifying the effects of PKM1/2 modulation on pluripotent and metabolic transcripts and by measuring shifts in the population frequencies of cells expressing naive and primed cell surface markers by flow cytometry. Our results demonstrate that modulating PKM1 and PKM2 levels alters the transition from the naive state into a primed pluripotent state by enhancing the proportion of the affected cells seen in the \"formative\" state. Therefore, we conclude that PKM1/2 actively contributes to mechanisms that oversee early stem pluripotency and their progression towards a primed pluripotent state.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Nucleic acid aptamers are bio-molecular recognition agents that bind to their targets with high specificity and affinity, and hold promise in a range of biosensor and therapeutic applications. In the case of small molecule targets, their small size and limited number of functional groups constitute challenges for their detection by aptamer-based biosensors because bio-recognition events may both be weak and produce poorly transduced signals. The binding affinity is principally used to characterize aptamer-ligand interactions; however a structural understanding of bio-recognition is arguably more valuable in order to design a strong response in biosensor applications. Using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we propose a binding model for a new methamphetamine aptamer and determine the main interactions driving complex formation. These measurements reveal only modest structural changes to the aptamer upon binding and are consistent with a conformational selection binding model. The aptamer-methamphetamine complex formation was observed to be entropically driven, apparently involving hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Taken together, our results establish a means of elucidating small molecule-aptamer binding interactions, which may be decisive in the development of aptasensors and therapeutics, and may contribute to a deeper understanding of interactions driving aptamer selection.",

Visual processing in subcortical areas like the pulvinar and amygdala have been shown to facilitate unconscious processing of salient stimuli. It is unknown, however, if and how these areas might interact with cortical networks to facilitate faster conscious perception of salient stimuli. Here we investigated these neural processes using 7T functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in concert with computational modelling while participants (n = 32) engaged in a breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm (bCFS) in which fearful and neutral faces are initially suppressed from conscious perception but then eventually \"breakthrough\" into awareness. We found that participants reported faster breakthrough times for fearful faces compared to neutral faces. Drift-diffusion modelling suggested that perceptual evidence was accumulated at a faster rate for fearful faces compared to neutral faces. For both neutral and fearful faces, faster response times coincided with greater activity in the amygdala (specifically within its subregions, including superficial, basolateral and amygdalo-striatal transition area) and the insula. Faster rates of evidence accumulation coincided with greater activity in frontoparietal regions and the occipital lobe, as well as the amygdala. Overall, our findings suggest that hastened perceptual awareness of salient stimuli recruits the amygdala and, more specifically, is driven by accelerated evidence accumulation in fronto-parietal and visual areas. In sum, we have uncovered and mapped distinct neural computations that accelerate perceptual awareness of visually suppressed faces.",

As such, developing biologically-based and generalizable genomic selection methods for metabolites that are transferable across plant populations would benefit plant breeding programs. We tested genomic prediction accuracy for more than 600 metabolites measured by GC-MS and LC-MS in oat (Avena sativa L.) seed. Using a discovery germplasm panel, we conducted metabolite GWAS (mGWAS) and selected loci to use in multi-kernel models that encompassed metabolome-wide mGWAS results, or mGWAS from specific metabolite structures or biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite kernels developed from LC-MS metabolites in the discovery panel improved prediction accuracy of LC-MS metabolite traits in the validation panel, consisting of more advanced breeding lines. No approach, however, improved prediction accuracy for GC-MS metabolites. We tested if similar metabolites had consistent model ranks and found that, while different metrics of  similarity had different results, using annotation-free methods to group metabolites led to consistent within-group model rankings. Overall, testing biological rationales for developing kernels for genomic prediction across populations, contributes to developing frameworks for plant breeding for metabolite traits.",

Different methods have been used to estimate species-environment relationships, but their differences to jointly fit and disentangle spatial autocorrelation and structure remain poorly studied. We compared how methods in four broad families of statistical models estimated the contribution of the environment and space to variation in species binary occurrence and abundance. These methods included distance-based regression, generalized linear models (GLM, and the special case of RDA), generalized additive models (GAM), and tree-based machine learning (ML): regression trees, boosted regression trees (BRT), and random forests. The spatial component of the model consisted of spatial distance (in distance-based regression), Morans Eigenvector Maps (MEM; in GLM and ML), smooth spatial splines (in GAM), or tree-based non-linear modelling of spatial coordinates (in ML). We simulated typical site-by-species data to assess the methods performance in (1) fitting environmental and spatial models, and (2) partitioning the variation explained by environmental and spatial predictors. We observed marked differences in performance mostly caused by imbalanced performance in estimating environmental and spatial effects. Such differences also manifested when analyzing eight different empirical datasets. GLM and BRT with MEMs were generally the most reliable methods for partitioning the variation explained by environmental and spatial effects across a wide range of simulated scenarios. The remaining methods tended to underfit simulated spatial structures, causing underestimation of spatial fractions of variation. Our results suggest that previously overlooked methods for performing variation partitioning, especially tree-based ML, offer flexible approaches to analyze site-by-species matrices. We provide general guidelines on the usefulness of different models under different ecological and sampling scenarios, for species distribution modelling, community ecology, and macroecology.",

In this study we proposed and validated a pre-clinical screening model for drug discovery by utilizing bioluminescence as our readout for the determination of transplanted cancer cell growth and inhibition in zebrafish embryos. For this purpose, we used NanoLuc luciferase, which ensured rapid cancer cell growth quantification in vivo with high sensitivity and low background when compared to conventional fluorescence measurements. This allowed us large-scale evaluation of in vivo drug responses of 180 kinase inhibitors in zebrafish. Our bioluminescent screening platform could facilitate identification of new small-molecules for targeted cancer therapy as well as for drug repurposing.",

Interestingly, the association between thyroid hormones (THs) and life history variation has never been considered, despite a close interaction between THs and these physiological traits. Because of the crucial effects on embryonic development, THs can also induce transgenerational plasticity when transferred to developing offspring, for instance, via egg yolks in birds. In this study, we compiled a unique data set of maternal yolk THs in 34 bird species across 17 families and 6 orders, and tested for associations with various life-history traits. Our phylogenetic mixed models indicated that both concentrations and total amounts of the two most important forms of THs (T3 and T4) were higher in the eggs of migratory species than in those of resident species, and that there were higher total amounts of T3 in the eggs of precocial species than in those of altricial species. However, maternal THs did not show clear associations with any traits of the pace-of-life syndrome, such as developmental duration, growth rate, or lifespan. When taking environmental factors into account, we found that captive species deposited higher TH concentrations and larger amounts in the egg yolks than wild species. These findings suggest that maternal THs are likely involved in the evolution of life-history variation, or vice versa.",

To understand exosome biology, their labelling and tracking studies are important. New and improved methods of exosome labelling for detection and tracking of exosomes need to be developed to harness their therapeutic and diagnostic potential. In this paper, we report a novel, simple and effective method of labelling and detecting exosomes using Oil red O (ORO) which is a dye commonly used for lipid staining. Using ORO is a cost effective and easy approach with intense red colouration of stained exosomes. Further, the issues faced with commonly used lipophilic dyes for exosomes labelling such as long term persistence of dyes, aggregation and micelle formation of dyes, difficulty to distinguish dye particles from labelled exosomes and detection of large aggregates of dye or dye-exosome are not seen with ORO dye. This method shows good labelling efficiency of exosomes with very sensitive detection and real-time tracking of the cellular uptake of exosomes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475514v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa8b8aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1df3d1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@125d8d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be48ef_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the effects of viruses remain largely unknown in many environments, including in drinking water systems. Drinking water metagenomic studies have offered a whole community perspective of bacterial impacts on water quality, but have not yet considered the influences of viruses. In this study, we address this gap by mining viral DNA sequences from publicly available drinking water metagenomes from distribution systems in six countries around the world. These datasets provide a snapshot of the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the global drinking water virome; and provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of geography, climate, and drinking water treatment practices on viral diversity. Both environmental conditions and differences in sample processing were found to influence the viral composition. Using free chlorine as the residual disinfectant was associated with clear differences in viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential, with significantly fewer viral populations and less even viral community structures than observed in distribution systems without residual disinfectant. Additionally, drinking water viruses carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as well as genes to survive oxidative stress and nitrogen limitation. Through this study, we have demonstrated that viral communities are diverse across drinking water systems and vary with the use of residual disinfectant. Our findings offer directions for future research to develop a more robust understanding of how virus-bacteria interactions in drinking water distribution systems affect water quality.",

Characterization of LA1141 derived purple pigmentation provides a test of the hybridization hypothesis. Purple pigmentation was recovered in progenies derived from LA1141 and the anthocyanins malvidin 3(coumaroyl)rutinoside-5-glucoside, petunidin 3-(coumaroyl) rutinoside-5-glucoside, and petunidin 3-(caffeoyl)rutinoside-5-glucoside were abundant. Fruit color was evaluated in an introgression population and three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were mapped and validated in subsequent populations. The loci atroviolacium on chromosome 7, Anthocyanin fruit on chromosome 10, and uniform ripening also on chromosome 10, underly these QTLs. Sequence analysis suggested that the LA1141 alleles of Aft and atv are unique relative to those previously described from S. chilense accession LA0458 and S. cheesmaniae accession LA0434, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the LA1141 Aft genomic sequence did not support a green-fruited origin and the locus clustered with members of the red-fruited tomato clade. The LA1141 allele of Aft is not the result of an ancient introgression and underlies a gain of anthocyanin pigmentation in the red-fruited clade.\n\nHighlightAnthocyanin fruit and atroviolacium confer purple pigmentation in Solanum galapagense LA1141 confirming a mechanism described for green-fruited tomatoes.

Currently, evaluating vasculature using mesoscopic PAI involves visual or semi-quantitative 2D measurements, which fail to capture 3D vessel network complexity, and lack robust ground truths for assessment of segmentation accuracy. Here, we developed an in silico, phantom, in vivo, and ex vivo-validated end-to-end framework to quantify 3D vascular networks captured using mesoscopic PAI. We applied our framework to evaluate the capacity of rule-based and machine learning-based segmentation methods, with or without vesselness image filtering, to preserve blood volume and network structure by employing topological data analysis. We first assessed segmentation performance against ground truth data of in silico synthetic vasculatures and a photoacoustic string phantom. Our results indicate that learning-based segmentation best preserves vessel diameter and blood volume at depth, while rule-based segmentation with vesselness image filtering accurately preserved network structure in superficial vessels. Next, we applied our framework to breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), with corresponding ex vivo immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that the above segmentation methods can reliably delineate the vasculature of 2 breast PDX models from mesoscopic PA images. Our results underscore the importance of evaluating the choice of segmentation method when applying mesoscopic PAI as a tool to evaluate vascular networks in vivo.",

We used the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. We employed RNA interference (RNAi) on selected targets and assayed synapse function and plasticity by electrophysiology. We focused our screen on genetic factors known to be conserved from human neurological or muscle functions (300 Drosophila lines screened). From our screen, knockdown of a Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunit gene (ND-20L) lowered levels of NMJ neurotransmission. Due to the severity of the phenotype, we studied MCI function further. Knockdown of core MCI subunits concurrently in neurons and muscle led to impaired neurotransmission. We localized this neurotransmission function to the muscle. Pharmacology targeting MCI phenocopied the impaired neurotransmission phenotype. Finally, MCI subunit knockdowns or pharmacological inhibition led to profound cytological defects, including reduced NMJ growth and altered NMJ morphology. Mitochondria are essential for cellular bioenergetics and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Five multi-protein complexes achieve this task, and MCI is the largest. Impaired Mitochondrial Complex I subunits in humans are associated with disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Leigh syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. Together, our data present an analysis of Complex I in the context of synapse function and plasticity. We speculate that in the context of human MCI dysfunction, similar neuronal and synaptic defects could contribute to pathogenesis.",

We discovered Nutrient-induced Mitochondrial Activity (NiMA), an inter-organelle signaling pathway where nutrient-stimulated lysosomal mTORC1 activity regulates mtDNA replication in neurons by a mechanism sensitive to amyloid-{beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), a primary factor in AD pathogenesis. Using 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation into mtDNA of cultured neurons, along with photoacoustic and mitochondrial metabolic imaging of cultured neurons and mouse brains, we show these effects being mediated by mTORC1-catalyzed T40 phosphorylation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Mechanistically, tau, another key factor in AD pathogenesis and other tauopathies, reduced the lysosomal content of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), thereby increasing NiMA and suppressing SOD1 activity and mtDNA synthesis. A{beta}Os inhibited these actions. Dysregulation of mtDNA synthesis was observed in fibroblasts derived from TS patients, who lack functional TSC and elevated SOD1 activity was also observed in human AD brain. Together, these findings imply that tau and SOD1 couple nutrient availability to mtDNA replication, linking mitochondrial dysfunction to AD.",

Pangasiids are a group of economically important catfishes in many South-Asian countries, but little is known about their sex determination system. Here, we generated novel genomic resources for 12 Pangasiid species and provided a first characterization of their SD system. Based on an Oxford Nanopore long-read chromosome-scale high quality genome assembly of the striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, we identified a duplication of the anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type II gene (amhr2), which was further characterized as being sex-linked in males and expressed only in testicular samples. These first results point to a male-specific duplication on the Y chromosome (amhr2by) of the autosomal amhr2a. Sequence annotation revealed that the P. hypophthalmus Amhr2by is truncated in its N-terminal domain, lacking the cysteine-rich extracellular part of the receptor that is crucial for ligand binding, suggesting a potential route for its neofunctionalization. Short-read genome sequencing and reference-guided assembly of 11 additional Pangasiid species, along with sex-linkage studies, revealed that this truncated amhr2by duplication is also conserved as a male-specific gene in many Pangasiids. Reconstructions of the amhr2 phylogeny suggested that amhr2by arose from an ancient duplication / insertion event at the root of the Siluroidei radiation that is dated around 100 million years ago. Altogether these results bring multiple lines of evidence supporting that amhr2by is an ancient and conserved master sex-determining gene in Pangasiid catfishes, a finding that highlights the recurrent usage of the transforming growth factor {beta} pathway in teleost sex determination and brings another empirical case towards the understanding of the dynamics or stability of sex determination systems.",

We examined inhibition of intramembrane metalloprotease SpoIVFB by proteins BofA and SpoIVFA. We found that BofA residues in and near a predicted transmembrane segment are required for SpoIVFB inhibition, and cross-linking experiments indicated that this transmembrane segment occupies the SpoIVFB active site cleft. SpoIVFA is also required for SpoIVFB inhibition. The inhibitory proteins block access of the substrate N-terminal Proregion to the membrane-embedded SpoIVFB active site, based on additional cross-linking experiments; however, the inhibitory proteins did not prevent interaction between the substrate C-terminal region and the SpoIVFB soluble domain. A structural model was built of SpoIVFB in complex with BofA and parts of SpoIVFA and substrate, using partial homology and constraints from cross-linking and co-evolutionary analyses. The model predicts that conserved BofA residues interact to stabilize a transmembrane segment and a membrane-embedded C-terminal region. SpoIVFA is predicted to bridge the BofA C-terminal region and SpoIVFB, forming a membrane-embedded inhibition complex. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of intramembrane protease inhibition with clear implications for relief from inhibition in vivo and design of inhibitors as potential therapeutics.",

Combining strong TCR and intact IL-2 signaling synergistically induces genome-wide chromatin accessibility in regions targeting a wide breadth of biological processes, consistent with their greater functional fitness. Chromatin accessibility in promoters of genes encoding for stem cell, cell cycle and calcium-related proteins correlated with faster intracellular calcium accumulation, initiation of cell cycle and more robust expansion. High-dimensional flow-cytometry analysis also highlights higher subset diversity and phenotypes. These results formally establish that epitope selection in vaccine design strongly impacts memory CD8+ T cell epigenetic programming and functions.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe strength of antigenic and interleukin 2 signals received by CD8+ T cells during vaccination epigenetically programs their ability to form functional memory.",

While autocatalysis is known to promote such chiral symmetry breaking, whether a similar phenomenon may also be induced in a more general class of configurable chemical systems--via energy exploitation--is a sensible yet underappreciated possibility. This work examines this question within a model of randomly generated complex chemical networks. We show that chiral symmetry breaking may occur spontaneously and generically by harnessing energy sources from external environmental drives. Key to this transition are intrinsic fluctuations of achiral-to-chiral reactions and tight matching of system configurations to the environmental drives, which together amplify and sustain diverged enantiomer distributions. These asymmetric states emerge through steep energetic transitions from the corresponding symmetric states and sharply cluster as highly-dissipating states. The results thus demonstrate a generic mechanism in which energetic drives may give rise to homochirality in an otherwise totally symmetrical environment, and from an early-life perspective, might emerge as a competitive, energy-harvesting advantage.",

Normal LVs contain the RNA genome, which is reverse transcribed into DNA and integrates into the host genome to mediate long-term gene expression. Recently, virus-like particles (VLPs) were developed for mRNA delivery. In these VLPs, packaging mRNA into the particles is achieved via interactions between the aptamer and aptamer-binding protein (ABP), and mRNA is not reverse transcribed or integrated. These VLPs are useful for delivering Cas9 mRNA for short-term endonuclease expression. Generating high-titer normal integrating LVs is challenging. Until recently, VLPs were not efficient for co-delivering Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA). By fusing ABP to the N-terminus of HIV Gag protein, hybrid particles were developed to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. But the method for modifying Gag impaired particle assembly. Previously we found that adding an ABP after the second zinc finger domain of nucleocapsid (NC) protein had minimal effects on particle assembly. Based on this observation, we developed hybrid particles to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. We further improved LVs for integrated gene expression by including an aptamer sequence in lentiviral transfer plasmids, which improved lentiviral particle production and enhanced LV genomic RNA packaging. In summary, we describe development of new all-in-one VLPs for co-delivery of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA and new LVs for enhanced vector production and gene expression.",

Ongoing concerns of emergent variants include possible recombinants, as genome recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism for the emergence and re-emergence of human viral pathogens. Although recombination events among SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were well-documented, it has been difficult to detect the recombination signatures in SARS-CoV-2 variants due to their high degree of sequence similarity. In this study, we identified diverse recombination events between two Omicron major subvariants (BA.1 and BA.2) and other variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs), suggesting that co-infection and subsequent genome recombination play important roles in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Through scanning high-quality completed Omicron spike gene sequences, eighteen core mutations of BA.1 variants (frequency >99%) were identified (eight in NTD, five near the S1/S2 cleavage site, and five in S2). BA.2 variants share three additional amino acid deletions with the Alpha variants. BA.1 subvariants share nine common amino acid mutations (three more than BA.2) in the spike protein with most VOCs, suggesting a possible recombination origin of Omicron from these VOCs. There are three more Alpha-related mutations (del69-70, del144) in BA.1 than BA.2, and therefore BA.1 may be phylogenetically closer to the Alpha variant. Revertant mutations are found in some dominant mutations (frequency >95%) in the BA.1 subvariant. Most notably, multiple additional amino acid mutations in the Delta spike protein were also identified in the recently emerged Omicron isolates, which implied possible recombination events occurred between the Omicron and Delta variants during the on-going pandemic. Monitoring the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes especially for recombination is critically important for recognition of abrupt changes to viral attributes including its epitopes which may call for vaccine modifications.",

We demonstrate here that the IQD1 overexpressing line (IQD1OXP) is more resistant also to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea, whereas an IQD1 knockout line (iqd1-1) is much more sensitive. Furthermore, we show that IQD1 is upregulated by Jasmonic acid (JA) and downregulated by Salicylic acid (SA). Comparison of whole transcriptome expression between iqd1-1 and wild type revealed a substantial downregulation of genes involved in plant defense and hormone regulation. Further examination revealed a marked reduction of SA/JA signaling and increase in ethylene signaling genes in the iqd1-1 line. Moreover, quantification of SA, JA and abscisic acids in IQD1OXP and iqd1-1lines compared to WT showed a significant reduction in endogenous JA levels in the knockout line simultaneously with increased SA levels. Epistasis relations between IQD1OXP and mutants defective in plant-hormone signaling indicated that IQD1 acts upstream or parallel to the hormonal pathways (JA/ET and SA) in defense response against B. cinerea and in regulating GS accumulation and it is dependent on JAR1 controlling indole glucosinolate accumulation. As a whole, our results suggest that IQD1 is an important defensive protein against Botrytis cinerea in A. thaliana and is integrated into several important pathways such as plant microbe perception and hormone signaling.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIQD1 is involved in glucosinolate accumulation and in general defense responses.

Robustly boosting their growth potential continues to be a challenge. Previously, we showed that constitutive activation of B-RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase) markedly promotes axon regeneration after dorsal root and optic nerve injuries. The regrowth is further augmented by supplemental deletion of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog). Here, we examined whether concurrent B-RAF activation and PTEN deletion promotes dorsal column axon regeneration after SCI. Remarkably, genetically targeting B-RAF and PTEN selectively in DRG neurons of adult mice enables many DC axons to enter, cross, and grow beyond the lesion site after SCI; some axons reach ~2 mm rostral to the lesion by 3 weeks post-injury. Co-targeting B-RAF and PTEN promotes more robust DC regeneration than a pre-conditioning lesion, which additively enhances the regeneration triggered by B-RAF/PTEN. We also found that post-injury targeting of B-RAF and PTEN enhances DC axon regeneration. These results demonstrate that co-targeting B-RAF and PTEN effectively enhances the intrinsic growth potential of DC axons after SCI and therefore may help to develop a novel strategy to promote robust long-distance regeneration of primary sensory axons.",

    "preprint_abstract": "NMR-derived chemical shifts are sensitive probes of RNA structure. However, the need to assign NMR spectra hampers their utility as a direct source of structural information. In this report, we describe a simple method that uses unassigned 2D NMR spectra to model the secondary structure of RNAs. Similar to assigned chemical shifts, we could use unassigned chemical shift data to reweight conformational libraries such that the highest weighted structure closely resembles their reference NMR structure. Furthermore, the application of our approach to the 3- and 5-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome yields structures that are, for the most part, consistent with the secondary structure models derived from chemical probing data. Therefore, we expect the framework we describe here will be useful as a general strategy for rapidly generating preliminary structural RNA models directly from unassigned 2D NMR spectra. As we demonstrated for the 337-nt and 472-nt UTRs of SARS-CoV-2, our approach could be especially valuable for modeling the secondary structures of large RNA.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Maturation of transcriptomes encoding unique neuronal identities requires selective accessibility of transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences in nucleosome- embedded postmitotic chromatin. Yet the mechanisms controlling postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility are poorly understood. We used ATAC-seq, ChIPmentation, and single-cell analyses to show that heterogeneous chromatin landscapes are established early and reveal the regulatory programs driving subtype identities of Pet1-lineage neurons that generate serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Distal enhancer accessibility is highly dynamic as Pet1 neurons mature, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors that reorganize postmitotic neuronal chromatin. We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to select Pet1-lineage specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission and synaptogenesis. Additionally, these factors are required to maintain chromatin accessibility during early maturation suggesting that postmitotic neuronal open chromatin is unstable and requires continuous regulatory input. Together our findings reveal postmitotic transcription factors that reorganize accessible chromatin for neuron specialization.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mosquito vectors transmit numerous pathogens, but large gaps remain in our understanding of their physiology. To facilitate future explorations of mosquito biology, with specific attention to the major vector Aedes aegypti, we have created Aegypti-Atlas (http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/), an online resource hosting RNAseq profiles of Ae. Aegypti body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, gut, Malpighian tubules, and ovaries), gut regions (crop, proventriculus, anterior and posterior midgut, and hindgut), and a time course of blood meal digestion in the gut. Using Aegypti-Atlas, we provide new insights into the regionalization of gut function, blood feeding response, and immune defenses. We find that the anterior and posterior regions of the mosquito midgut possess clearly delineated digestive specializations which are preserved in the blood-fed state. Blood feeding initiates the sequential transcriptional induction and repression/depletion of multiple cohorts of peptidases throughout blood meal digestion. With respect to defense, immune signaling components, but not recognition or effector molecules, show enrichment in ovaries. Basal expression of antimicrobial peptides is dominated by two genes, holotricin and gambicin, that are expressed in the carcass and the digestive tissues, respectively, in a near mutually exclusive manner. In the midgut, gambicin and other immune effector genes are almost exclusively expressed in the anterior regions, while the posterior midgut exhibits the hallmarks of immune tolerance. Finally, in a cross-species comparison between the midguts of Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, we observe that regional digestive and immune specializations are closely conserved, indicating that our data may yield inferences that are broadly relevant to multiple mosquito vector species. We further demonstrate that the expression of orthologous genes is highly correlated, with the exception of a  species signature comprising a small number of highly/disparately expressed genes. With this work, we show the potential of Aegypti-Atlas to unlock a more complete understanding of mosquito biology.",

Their interaction with dendritic cells (DC) allows DC activation and maturation toward presentation of NET-associated antigens. Differently from other types of cell death that imply protein denaturation, NETosis preserves the proteins localized onto the DNA threads for proper enzymatic activity and conformational status, including immunogenic epitopes. Besides neutrophils, leukemic cells can release extracellular traps displaying leukemia-associated antigens, prototypically mutant nucleophosmin (NPMc+) that upon mutation translocates from nucleolus to the cytoplasm localizing onto NET threads. We tested NPMc+ immunogenicity through a NET/DC vaccine to treat NPMc-driven myeloproliferation in transgenic and transplantable models. Vaccination with DC loaded with NPMc+ NET (NPMc+ NET/DC) reduced myeloproliferation in transgenic mice, favoring the development of antibodies to mutant NPMc and and the induction of a CD8+ T cell response. The efficacy of this vaccine was also tested in mixed NPMc/WT bone marrow chimeras in a competitive bone marrow transplantation setting, where the NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination impaired the expansion of NPMc+ in favor of WT myeloid compartment. NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination also achieved control of an aggressive leukemia transduced with mutant NPMc, effectively inducing an anti-leukemia CD8 T cell memory response.\n\neTOC SummaryNPMc is an AML-triggering mutation inducing translocation of NPM into the cytoplasm, allowing its association to NET threads. On NET, NPMc becomes immunogenic acting as an alarmin and exposing immunogenic peptides. We demonstrate that NET can be exploited as anti-tumor weapons in DC-based vaccination strategies.",

Using deepscale, quantitative analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse neocortical neurons, we found wide-spread and temporally complex changes during synaptic scaling up and down. We observed 424 bidirectionally modulated phosphosites that were strongly enriched for synapse-associated proteins, including S1539 in the ASD-associated synaptic scaffold protein Shank3. Using a parallel proteomic analysis performed on Shank3 isolated from rat neocortical neurons by immunoaffinity, we identified two sites that were hypo-phosphorylated during scaling up and hyper-phosphorylated during scaling down: one (rat S1615) that corresponded to S1539 in mouse, and a second highly conserved site, rat S1586. The phosphorylation status of these sites modified the synaptic localization of Shank3 during scaling protocols, and dephosphorylation of these sites via PP2A activity was essential for the maintenance of synaptic scaling up. Finally, phosphomimetic mutations at these sites prevented scaling up but not down, while phosphodeficient mutations prevented scaling down but not up. Thus, an activity-dependent switch between hypo- and hyperphosphorylation at S1586/ S1615 of Shank3 enables scaling up or down, respectively. Collectively our data show that activity-dependent phosphoproteome dynamics are important for the functional reconfiguration of synaptic scaffolds, and can bias synapses toward upward or downward homeostatic plasticity.",

An exuberant spray of fine telodendria extends from each cone pedicle (including blue cones) to contact 40-50 nearby rod spherules where Cx36 clusters were located, close to the mouth of the synaptic opening. There were approximately 50 Cx36 clusters per cone pedicle and 2-3 per rod spherule. We were unable to detect rod/rod or cone/cone coupling. Thus, rod/cone coupling accounts for nearly all gap junctions between photoreceptors. Our calculations suggest a mean of 82 Cx36 channels between a rod/cone pair of which 25% are open at rest. Rod/cone gap junctions are modulated by dopamine. Comparing our morphological calculations of maximum coupling to previous physiological results suggests that dopamine antagonists can drive rod/cone gap junctions to a surprisingly high open probability, approaching 100%.",

In particular, the central pain system comprising ascending and descending pain pathways has high opioid receptor densities and is thus crucial for opioid analgesia. Here, we investigated effects of the opioid remifentanil in a large sample (n=78) of healthy male participants using combined cortico-spinal fMRI. This approach offers the possibility to measure BOLD responses simultaneously in the brain and spinal cord allowing us to investigate the role of cortico-spinal coupling in opioid analgesia. Our data show that opioids altered activity in regions involved in pain processing such as somatosensory regions including the spinal cord and pain modulation such as prefrontal regions. Moreover, coupling strength along the descending pain system, i.e. between the medial prefrontal cortex, periaqueductal gray and spinal cord was stronger in participants who reported stronger analgesia during opioid treatment while the reversed pattern was observed in the control group. These results indicate that coupling along the descending pain pathway is a potential mechanism of opioid analgesia and can differentiate between opioid analgesia and unspecific reductions in pain such as habituation.",

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to explore different surgical options. The objective of this study is to perform a systematic in vitro validation for investigating the accuracy and efficiency of CFD simulation to predict Fontan hemodynamics.\n\nMethodsCFD simulations were performed to measure indexed power loss (iPL) and hepatic flow distribution (HFD) in 10 patient-specific Fontan models, with varying mesh and numerical solvers. The results were compared with a novel in vitro flow loop setup with 3D printed Fontan models. A high-resolution differential pressure sensor was used to measure the pressure drop for validating iPL predictions. Microparticles with particle filtering system were used to measure HFD. The computational time was measured for a representative Fontan model with different mesh sizes and numerical solvers.\n\nResultsWhen compared to in vitro setup, variations in CFD mesh sizes had significant effect on HFD (p = 0.0002) but no significant impact on iPL (p = 0.069). Numerical solvers had no significant impact in both iPL (p = 0.50) and HFD (P = 0.55). A transient solver with 0.5 mm mesh size requires computational time 100 times more than a steady solver with 2.5 mm mesh size to generate similar results.\n\nConclusionsThe predictive value of CFD for Fontan planning can be validated against an in vitro flow loop.

With input from the community, EMDB has developed new resources for validation of cryo-EM structures, focussing on the quality of the volume data alone and that of the fit of any models, themselves archived in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), to the volume data. Based on recommendations from community experts, the validation resources are developed in a three-tiered system. Tier 1 covers an extensive and evolving set of validation metrics, including tried and tested as well as more experimental ones, which are calculated for all EMDB entries and presented in the Validation Analysis (VA) web resource. This system is particularly useful for cryo-EM experts, both to validate individual structures and to assess the utility of new validation metrics. Tier 2 comprises a subset of the validation metrics covered by the VA resource that have been subjected to extensive testing and are considered to be useful for specialists as well as non-specialists. These metrics are presented on the entry-specific web pages for the entire archive on the EMDB website. As more experience is gained with the metrics included in the VA resource, it is expected that consensus will emerge in the community regarding a subset that is suitable for inclusion in the tier 2 system. Tier 3, finally, consists of the validation reports and servers that are produced by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) Consortium. Successful metrics from tier 2 will be proposed for inclusion in the wwPDB validation pipeline and reports. We describe the details of the new resource, with an emphasis on the tier 1 system. The output of all three tiers is publicly available, either through the EMDB website (tiers 1 and 2) or through the wwPDB ftp sites (tier 3), although the content of all three will evolve over time (fastest for tier 1 and slowest for tier 3). It is our hope that these validation resources will help the cryo-EM community to get a better understanding of the quality, and the best ways to assess the quality of cryo-EM structures in EMDB and PDB.",

Here, we show that both mouse and zebrafish DCST1 and DCST2 are necessary in sperm to fertilize the egg, similar to their orthologs SPE-42 and SPE-49 in C. elegans and Sneaky in D. melanogaster. Mouse Dcst1 and Dcst2 single knockout (KO) spermatozoa are able to undergo the acrosome reaction and show normal relocalization of IZUMO1, an essential factor for sperm-egg fusion, to the equatorial segment. While both single KO spermatozoa can bind to the oolemma, they rarely fuse with oocytes, resulting in male sterility. Similar to mice, zebrafish dcst1 KO males are subfertile and dcst2 and dcst1/2 double KO males are sterile. Zebrafish dcst1/2 KO spermatozoa are motile and can approach the egg, but rarely bind to the oolemma. These data demonstrate that DCST1/2 are essential for male fertility in two vertebrate species, highlighting their crucial role as conserved factors in fertilization.",

To provide an unbiased insight into its evolutionary affiliations and biological interactions, we coupled long-read DNA sequencing with a multiplatform scaffolding approach to produce an ab initio genome assembly of the desert dingo (85X coverage) we call CanLup_DDS. We compared this genome to the Boxer (CanFam3.1) and German Shepherd dog (CanFam_GSD) assemblies and characterized lineage-specific and shared genetic variation ranging from single- to megabase pair-sized variants. We identified 21,483 dingo-specific and 16,595 domestic dog-specific homozygous structural variants mediating genic and putative regulatory changes. Comparisons between the dingo and domestic dog builds detected unique inversions on Chromosome 16, structural variations in genes linked with starch metabolism, and seven differentially methylated genes. To experimentally assess genomic differences 17 dingoes and 15 German Shepherd dogs were fed parallel diets for 14 days. In dingoes, low AMY2B copy number and serum amylase levels are linked with high cholesterol and LDL levels. Gut microbiome analyses revealed enrichment of the family Clostridiaceae, which can utilize complex resistant starch, while scat metabolome studies identified high phenylethyl alcohol concentrations that we posit are linked with territory marking. Our study provides compelling genomic, microbiome, and metabolomic links showing the dingo has distinct physiology from domestic breed dogs with a unique role in the ecosystem.",

Of these donors, one had recently completed chemotherapy, and one was undergoing treatment with monoclonal antibodies; the others reported no known health issue.\n\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The outcomes were the measurement of T cell reactivity to the mutated regions of the Spike protein of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant and the assessment of remaining T cell immunity to the spike protein by stimulation with peptide libraries.\n\nResultsLymphocytes from freshly drawn blood samples were isolated and immediately tested for reactivity to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. T cell responses to peptides covering the mutated regions in the Omicron variant were decreased by over 47% compared to the same regions of the ancestral vaccine strain. However, overall reactivity to the peptide library of the full-length protein was largely maintained (estimated 83%). No significant differences in loss of immune recognition were identified between groups of donors with different vaccination and/or infection histories.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceWe conclude that despite the mutations in the Spike protein, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is nonetheless recognized by the cellular component of the immune system. It is reasonable to assume that protection from hospitalization and severe disease is maintained.\n\nKey PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 escape cellular immunity?\n\nFindingsThis observational study was performed on 61 vaccinated donors with established immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Cellular responses to the mutated regions of the Omicron Spike protein were detected in 80% of donors. The mutations reduced T cell recognition by 47% compared to the vaccine strain. Reactivity to the whole Spike protein, however, was present in 100% of donors, and the fraction of remaining immunity to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 83%.\n\nMeaningCellular immunity to the Omicron variant is maintained despite the mutations in its Spike protein, and may thus confer protection from severe COVID-19 in vaccinated individuals.",

It is not completely understood, however, how this local cytoskeleton remodeling is coordinated. The centrosome, the main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), has been suggested to be crucial for axon specification 1-5. Conversely, it was proposed that axon elongation is independent of centrosomal functions 6. Here we report that microtubule dynamics in early neurons follow a radial organization which establishes the conditions for the axon formation. Using high-resolution microscopy of early developing neurons, we demonstrate that few somatic acetylated microtubules are restricted near the centrosome. At later stages, however, acetylated microtubules spread out in the soma and concentrate in the growing axon. Furthermore, live-imaging of the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB3 in early differentiating neurons shows that growing microtubules have increased length and growth speed near the MTOC, suggesting local differences that might favor axon selection. Importantly, due to the lack of somatic stable/acetylated microtubules in early developing neurons, disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton does not induce multiple axons, as it does at later stages of differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of the centrosomal protein 120 (Cep120), known for promoting microtubule acetylation and stabilization, induces multiple axons, while its downregulation decreases the content of proteins regulating microtubule dynamics and stability, hence hampering axon formation. Collectively, our data show that early centrosome-dependent microtubule organization contributes to axon formation.",

In turn, the response of the intestinal epithelial cells to the peristaltic stresses affects the dynamics of the epithelial structure. In this work, we study the effect of cyclic stretching (0.125 Hz, 10% strain) on the spatial organization of the intestinal epithelium using intestinal cells deposited on a flat elastomeric substrate to mimic the peristaltic motion in vitro. A confluent monolayer of Caco-2 cells is grown on a PDMS chip to probe the morphological and orientational response of the tissue to cyclic stretching. The PDMS chips are either covalently or non-covalently coated with laminin to recapitulate the basement membrane. We observe a significant orientational response where the cells rearrange their long axes perpendicular to the stretching direction for both coating conditions. The experiment is modeled by a vertex model where the cells store elastic energy with varying strain and effectively have a rotational diffusive motion through rearrangements of their shapes. The model also predicts a transition between the perpendicular orientation and orientation at an oblique angle determined by the level of the cell elastic anisotropy. It provides a general framework to study cell response and relaxation dynamics under cyclic stretching across different cell types. We also discuss potential relevance of peristalsis in determining planar cell polarity in 3D architectures.",

Generating such alignments introduces references biases, in particular against insertion alleles absent in the reference and comes with substantial computational burden. In contrast, recent k-mer-based genotyping methods are fast, but struggle in repetitive or duplicated regions of the genome. We propose a novel algorithm, called PanGenie, that leverages a pangenome reference built from haplotype-resolved genome assemblies in conjunction with k-mer count information from raw, short-read sequencing data to genotype a wide spectrum of genetic variation. The given haplotypes enable our method to take advantage of linkage information to aid genotyping in regions poorly covered by unique k-mers and provides access to regions otherwise inaccessible by short reads. Compared to classic mapping-based approaches, our approach is more than 4x faster at 30x coverage and at the same time, reached significantly better genotype concordances for almost all variant types and coverages tested. Improvements are especially pronounced for large insertions (> 50bp), where we are able to genotype > 99.9% of all tested variants with over 90% accuracy at 30x short-read coverage, where the best competing tools either typed less than 60% of variants or reached accuracies below 70%. PanGenie now enables the inclusion of this commonly neglected variant type in downstream analyses.",

We studied temporal and spatial patterns of the microbial community structure and activity along a coast to offshore transect from the Israeli coast of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) over six cruises, in three seasons of two consecutive years. The ultra-oligotrophic status of the South Eastern Mediterranean Sea was reflected in the microbial community composition that was dominated by oligotrophic microbial groups such as SAR11 throughout the year, even at the most coastal station sampled. Seasons affected microbial communities much more than distance from shore explaining about half of the observed variability in the microbial community, compared to only about 6% that was explained by station. However, the most coastal site differed significantly in community structure and activity from the three further offshore stations in early winter and summer, but not in spring. Our data on the microbial community composition and its seasonality from a transect into the South Eastern Levantine basin support the notion that the EMS behaves similar to open gyres rather than an inland sea.",

If misrepaired, DSBs can lead to cancer, neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency and premature ageing. Based on systematic proteome microarray screening combined with widely applicable carbene footprinting and high-resolution structural profiling, we define two non-conventional SUMO2-binding modules on XRCC4, a DNA repair protein important for DSB repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Mechanistically, interaction of SUMO2 with XRCC4 is incompatible with XRCC4 binding to at least two other NHEJ proteins - XLF and DNA ligase 4 (LIG4). These findings are consistent with SUMO2 interactions of XRCC4 acting as backup pathways at different stages of NHEJ, in the absence of these factors or their dysfunctioning. Such scenarios are not only relevant for carcinogenesis, but also for the design of precision anti-cancer medicines and the optimisation of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing. This work reveals insights into topology-specific SUMO recognition and its potential for modulating DSB repair by NHEJ. Moreover, it provides a rich resource on binary SUMO receptors that can be exploited for uncovering regulatory layers in a wide array of cellular processes.",

In addition, changing climate and land use are already driving geographic range shifts in wildlife, producing novel species assemblages and opportunities for viral sharing between previously isolated species 4, 5 . In some cases, this will inevitably facilitate spillover into humans 6, 7 --a possible mechanistic link between global environmental change and emerging zoonotic disease 8 . Here, we map potential hotspots of viral sharing, using a phylogeographic model of the mammal-virus network, and projections of potential geographic range shifts for 3,139 mammal species under climate change and land use scenarios for the year 2070. Range-shifting mammal species are predicted to aggregate at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, driving the novel cross-species transmission of their viruses an estimated 4,000 times. Counter to expectations, holding warming under 2{degrees}C within the century does not reduce new viral sharing, due to greater potential range expansions-- highlighting the need to invest in surveillance even in a low-warming future. Most projected viral sharing is driven by diverse hyperreservoirs (rodents and bats) and large-bodied predators (carnivores). Because of their unique dispersal capacity, bats account for the majority of novel viral sharing, and are likely to share viruses along evolutionary pathways that could facilitate future emergence in humans. Our findings highlight the urgent need to pair viral surveillance and discovery efforts with biodiversity surveys tracking species range shifts, especially in tropical countries that harbor the most emerging zoonoses.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Confining the activity of a designed protein to a specific microenvironment would have broad-ranging applications, such as enabling cell type-specific therapeutic action by enzymes while avoiding off-target effects. While many natural enzymes are synthesized as inactive zymogens that can be activated by proteolysis, it has been challenging to re-design any chosen enzyme to be similarly stimulus-responsive. Here, we develop a massively parallel computational design, screening, and next-generation sequencing-based approach for pro-enzyme design. As a model system, we employ carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2), a clinically approved enzyme that has applications in both the treatment of cancer and controlling drug toxicity. Detailed kinetic characterization of the most effective designed variants shows that they are inhibited by approximately 80% compared to the unmodified protein, and their activity is fully restored following incubation with site-specific proteases. Introducing disulfide bonds between the pro-and catalytic domains based on the design models increases the degree of inhibition to 98%, but decreases the degree of restoration of activity by proteolysis. A selected disulfide-containing pro-enzyme exhibits significantly lower activity relative to the fully activated enzyme when evaluated in cell culture. Structural and thermodynamic characterization provides detailed insights into the pro-domain binding and inhibition mechanisms. The described methodology is general and could enable the design of a variety of pro-proteins with precise spatial regulation.\n\nSignificanceProteins have shown promise as therapeutics and diagnostics, but their effectiveness is limited by our inability to spatially target their activity. To overcome this limitation, we developed a computationally-guided method to design inactive \"pro-enzymes\" or \"zymogens,\" which are activated through cleavage by a protease. Since proteases are differentially expressed in various tissues and disease states, including cancer, these pro-enzymes could be targeted to the desired microenvironment. We tested our method on the therapeutically-relevant protein, carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2). We designed Pro-CPG2s that are inhibited by 80-98% and are partially to fully re-activatable following protease treatment. The developed methodology, with further refinements, could pave the way for routinely designing protease-activated protein-based therapeutics and diagnostics that act in a spatially controlled manner.",

Bruggmanniella is confirmed here as a monophyletic Neotropical lineage, divergent from the Asian species. The phylogenetic reconstruction hypothesized here reinforces the pertinence of the genus Odontokeros to house all species occurring in the Oriental/Palearctic region under Bruggmanniella. The delimitation of Bruggmanniella, the geographical distribution, and niche occupation are discussed.",

Here we analyzed neocortical cellular lineages through a comprehensive assessment of brain somatic mosaicism--which acts as a neutral recorder of lineage history. We employed deep whole genome and variant sequencing in a single postmortem neurotypical human brain across 25 anatomic regions and three distinct modalities: bulk geographies, sorted cell types, and single nuclei. We identified 259 mosaic variants, revealing remarkable differences in localization, clonal abundance, cell type specificity, and clade distribution. We identified a set of hierarchical cellular diffusion barriers, whereby the left-right axis separation of the neocortex occurs prior to anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axis separation. We also found that stochastic distribution is a driver of clonal dispersion, and that rules regarding cellular lineages and anatomical boundaries are often ignored. Our data provides a comprehensive analysis of brain somatic mosaicism across the human cerebral cortex, deconvolving clonal distributions and migration patterns in the human embryo.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryComprehensive evaluation of brain somatic mosaicism in the adult human identifies rules governing cellular distribution during embryogenesis.",

Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias can be severe complications in patients with inherited defects in mitochondrial long-chain FAO, reinforcing the importance of FAO for cardiac health. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the cardiac abnormalities in long-chain FAO disorders remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the cardiac transcriptional adaptations to the FAO defect in the long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) knockout (KO) mouse. We found a prominent activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) mediated by the eIF2/ATF4 axis in both fed and fasted states, accompanied by a reduction in cardiac protein synthesis during a short period of food withdrawal. Notably, we found an accumulation of uncharged tRNAs in LCAD KO hearts, consistent with a reduced availability of cardiac amino acids, in particular, glutamine. We replicated the activation of the cardiac ISR in hearts of mice with a muscle-specific deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deletion (Cpt2M-/-). Our results show that perturbations in amino acid metabolism caused by long-chain FAO deficiency impact cardiac metabolic signaling, in particular the ISR, and may play a role in the associated cardiac pathology.",

MISTy builds multiple views focusing on different spatial or functional contexts to dissect different effects, such as those from direct neighbours versus those from distant cells. MISTy can be applied to different spatially resolved omics data with dozens to thousands of markers, without the need to perform cell-type annotation. We evaluate the performance of MISTy on an in silico dataset and demonstrate its applicability on three breast cancer datasets, two measured by imaging mass cytometry and one by Visium spatial transcriptomics. We show how we can estimate interactions coming from different spatial contexts that we can relate to tumor progression and clinical features. Our analysis also reveals that the estimated interactions in triple negative breast cancer are associated with clinical outcomes which could improve patient stratification. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of MISTy to integrate different kinds of views by modeling activities of pathways estimated from gene expression in a spatial context to analyse intercellular signaling.",

A subset of tumor cells bypass this requirement and progress to the next cell division in the absence of continued signaling. B and T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system undergo a proliferative burst, termed clonal expansion, to generate pools of antigen specific cells for effective immunity. There is evidence that rules for lymphocyte cell division digress from the canonical model. Here we show that B lymphocytes sustain several rounds of mitogen-independent cell division following the first mitosis. Such division is driven by unique characteristics of the post mitotic G1 phase and limited by extensive cell death that can be circumvented by appropriate anti-apoptotic signals. An essential component for continued cell division is Birc5 (survivin), a protein associated with chromosome segregation in G2/M. Our observation provides direct evidence for Pardees hypothesis that retention of features of G2M in post-mitotic cells could trigger further cell cycle progression. The partially active G1 phase and propensity for apoptosis that is inherited after each division may permit rapid burst of proliferation and cell death that are hallmarks of immune responses.",

Although being a basic region leucine zipper with its own DNA recognition motif, HapX function strictly relies on the CBC. We here report two crystal structures of the CBC-HapX complex bound to DNA duplexes with distinct sequence and position of HapX sites. In either structure, a HapX dimer targets the nucleic acid downstream of the CCAAT-box and the leash-like N-terminus of the distal HapX subunit interacts with CBC and DNA.

While UPF3B has been demonstrated to support NMD, contradicting reports describe UPF3A either as an NMD activator or inhibitor. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of UPF3A and UPF3B in human cells using combinatory experimental approaches. Overexpression or knockout of UPF3A as well as knockout of UPF3B did not detectably change global NMD activity. In contrast, the co-depletion of UPF3A and UPF3B resulted in a marked NMD inhibition and a transcriptome-wide upregulation of NMD substrates, demonstrating a functional redundancy between both NMD factors. Although current models assume that UPF3 bridges NMD-activating exon-junction complexes (EJC) to the NMD factor UPF2, UPF3B exhibited only slightly impaired NMD activity in rescue experiments when UPF2 or EJC binding was impaired. Further rescue experiments revealed partially redundant functions of UPF3B domains in supporting NMD, involving both UPF2 and EJC interaction sites and the central region of UPF3. Collectively, UPF3A and UPF3B serve as fault-tolerant NMD activators in human cells.",

However, it has not been clear which target genes are required for Myc-induced growth, and whether the targets are individually necessary or act in an additive fashion. Here, we have used comparative functional genomics to identify a core set of Myc target genes whose regulation is conserved between humans and Drosophila melanogaster. Most of these targets are essential genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and ribonucleotide metabolism. To identify Drosophila genes whose upregulation is necessary for Myc induced growth, we deleted the Myc binding sites (E-boxes) in the promoter regions of four genes using CRISPR/Cas9. All mutant flies were homozygous viable, indicating that E-box sequences are not required for basal expression of the Myc target genes. E-Box deletions in RpS20, RpS24 and Nop56 did not cause strong growth phenotypes. However, deletion of the E-box in the rRNA processing factor Peter Pan (ppan) made the flies resistant to Myc-induced cell growth, without affecting Myc-induced apoptosis. Despite their failure to respond to Myc, the ppanEbox-/- flies are healthy and display only a minor developmental delay, suggesting that it may be possible to treat or prevent tumorigenesis by targeting individual downstream targets of Myc.",

DMN dysregulation has been implicated in several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and spectral fiber-photometry to investigate the selective neuromodulatory effect of norepinephrine (NE)-releasing noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) on the DMN in mice. Chemogenetic-induced tonic LC-NE activity decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV) and glucose uptake, and increased synchronous low frequency fMRI activity within the frontal cortices of the DMN. Fiber-photometry results corroborated these findings, showing that LC-NE activation induced NE release, enhanced calcium-weighted neuronal spiking, and reduced CBV in the anterior cingulate cortex. These data suggest that LC-NE alters conventional stimulus-evoked coupling between neuronal activity and CBV in the frontal DMN. We also demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of LC-NE neurons strengthened functional connectivity within the frontal DMN, and this effect was causally mediated by reduced modulatory inputs from retrosplenial and hippocampal regions to the association cortices of the DMN.",

Strikingly, we observed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergo widespread apoptosis upon Wnt activation, followed by a synchronous epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT requires induction of transcription factors SNAI1/SNAI2 downstream of MESP1 expression, and double knock-out of SNAI1/2, or loss of MESP1 in iPSCs blocks EMT and prevents cardiac differentiation. Remarkably, blockade of early apoptosis chemically or by ablation of pro-apoptotic genes also completely prevents the EMT, suppressing even the earliest events in mesoderm conversion, including EOMES, TBX6, and MESP1 induction. Conditioned medium from WNT-activated WT iPSCs overcomes the block to EMT by cells incapable of apoptosis (Apop-), suggesting the involvement of soluble factors from apoptotic cells in mesoderm conversion. Treatment with a purinergic P2Y receptor inhibitor or addition of apyrase demonstrated a requirement for nucleotide triphosphate signaling. ATP was sufficient to induce a partial EMT in Apop- cells treated with WNT activator. We conclude that nucleotides, in addition to acting as chemo-attractants for clearance of apoptotic cells can, unexpectedly, function as essential paracrine signals in mesoderm specification.",

However, the microevolution of P. aeruginosa laboratory strains resulting in genetic and phenotypic variations have caused inconsistencies in QS research. To investigate the underlying causes and impact of these variations, we analyzed 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 sublines from our laboratory using a combination of phenotypic characterization, high-throughput genome sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. The major phenotypic variations among the sublines spanned across the levels of QS signals and virulence factors such as pyocyanin and elastase. Furthermore, the sublines exhibited distinct variations in swarming, twitching and biofilm formation. Most of the phenotypic variations were mapped to the effects of mutations in the lasR and mexT, which are key components of the QS circuit. By introducing these mutations in the subline PAO1-E, which is devoid of such mutations, we confirmed their influence on QS, virulence, motility and biofilm formation. The findings further highlight a possible divergent regulatory mechanism between the LasR and MexT in the QS pathways in P. aeruginosa. The results of our study reveal the effects of microevolution on the reproducibility of most research data from QS studies and further highlight mexT as a key component of the QS circuit of P. aeruginosa.\n\nImportanceMicroevolution of P. aeruginosa laboratory strains results in genotypic and phenotypic variations between strains that have a significant influence on QS research. This work highlights the variations present in P. aeruginosa PAO1 sublines and investigates the impact of the genetic variations on the QS circuit and QS-regulated virulence determinants. Using a combination of NGS and phenotypic analysis, we illustrate the impact of microevolution on the reproducibility of QS, virulence, motility, and biofilm studies among 5 sublines. Additionally, we revealed the significant impact of mutations in key genes such as mexT and lasR on the QS circuit and regulation of virulence. In effect, we show the need for limited propagation and proper handling of laboratory isolates to reduce the microevolution.",

A zebrafish xenotransplantation model of metastasis validated that CBE suppressed metastatic dissemination of human cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Interestingly, quantitative metabolome analyses revealed that CBE-treated MDA-MB-231 cells disrupted the production of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), which are intermediate metabolites of glycolytic metabolism. CBE decreased the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2), which catalyzes G6P production, and pharmacological inhibition of HK2 suppressed cell invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, CBE suppressed metastatic dissemination of human cancer cells by inhibiting glycolytic metabolism.",

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the key physiological systems that counterbalances this systemic inflammation through changes in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. These hormones normally exhibit highly correlated ultradian pulsatility with an amplitude modulated by circadian processes. However, these dynamics are disrupted by major surgery and critical illness. In this work, we characterise the inflammatory, ACTH and cortisol responses of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and show that the HPA axis response can be classified into one of three phenotypes: single-pulse, two-pulses and multiple-pulses dynamics. We develop a mathematical model of cortisol secretion and metabolism that predicts the physiological mechanisms responsible for these different phenotypes. We show that the effects of inflammatory mediators are important only in the single-pulse pattern in which normal pulsatility is lost - suggesting that this phenotype could be indicative of the greatest inflammatory response. Investigating whether and how these phenotypes are correlated with clinical outcomes will be critical to patient prognosis and designing interventions to improve recovery.",

The keystone species Ruminococcus bromii (Rb) is a specialist in degrading resistant starch; its degradation products are used by other bacteria including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt). We analyzed the metabolic and spatial relationships between Rb and Bt during potato starch degradation and found that Bt utilizes glucose that is released from Rb upon degradation of resistant potato starch and soluble potato amylopectin. Additionally, we found that Rb produces a halo of glucose around it when grown on solid media containing potato amylopectin and that Bt cells deficient for growth on potato amylopectin ({Delta}sus Bt) can grow within the halo. Furthermore, when these {Delta}sus Bt cells grow within this glucose halo, they have an elongated cell morphology. This long-cell phenotype depends on the glucose concentration in the solid media: longer Bt cells are formed at higher glucose concentrations. Together, our results indicate that starch degradation by Rb cross-feeds other bacteria in the surrounding region by releasing glucose. Our results also elucidate the adaptive morphology of Bt cells under different nutrient and physiological conditions.\n\nImpact StatementDietary intake of complex carbohydrates including resistant starch benefits human health by supporting the growth of keystone species that increase the microbiome diversity via cross-feeding. For instance, Ruminococcus bromii (Rb) is a specialist in degrading resistant starch, and the byproducts of this degradation process are used by bacterial species. In this study, we show that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) cross-feeds on the glucose released during potato starch degradation by Rb. We also show that proximity to Rb cells that are releasing sugars is important for the growth of the cross-fed Bt in solid media. Additionally, we find a longer phenotype for Bt cells grown on solid media in high glucose conditions, indicating that, like other bacteria, human gut bacteria undergo significant nutrient-dependent morphological adaptations.",

In particular, studies of intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding in laboratory rodents have found evidence of beneficial health outcomes. Companion dogs represent a unique opportunity to study diet in a large mammal that shares human environments. The Dog Aging Project has been collecting data on thousands of companion dogs of all different ages, sizes, and breeds since 2019. We leveraged this diverse cross-sectional dataset to investigate associations between feeding frequency and cognitive function (n = 10,474) as well as nine broad categories of health conditions (n = 24,238). Controlling for sex, age, breed, and other potential confounders, we found that dogs fed once daily rather than more frequently had lower mean scores on a cognitive dysfunction scale, and lower odds of having gastrointestinal, dental, orthopedic, kidney/urinary, and liver/pancreas disorders. Therefore, we find that once-daily feeding is associated with better health in multiple domains. Future research with longitudinal data can provide stronger evidence for a possible causal effect of feeding frequency on health in companion dogs.",

Monkeyflower (Phrymaceae) is a model system for evolutionary ecology. However, it lacks a well-supported phylogeny for a stable taxonomy and for macroevolutionary comparisons.\n\nMethodsWe sampled 24 genomes and transcriptomes in Phrymaceae and closely related families, including eight newly sequenced transcriptomes. We reconstructed the phylogeny using IQ-TREE and ASTRAL, evaluated gene tree discordance using PhyParts, Quartet Sampling, and cloudogram, and carried out phylogenetic network analyses using PhyloNet and HyDe. We searched for whole genome duplication (WGD) events using chromosome numbers, synonymous distance, and gene duplication events.\n\nKey resultsMost gene trees support the monophyly of Phrymaceae and each of its tribes. Most gene trees also support the tribe Mimuleae being sister to Phrymeae + Diplaceae + Leucocarpeae, with extensive gene tree discordance among the latter three. Despite the discordance, polyphyly of Mimulus s.l. is strongly supported, and no particular reticulation event among the Phrymaceae tribes is well supported. Reticulation likely occurred among Erythranthe bicolor and close relatives. No ancient WGD event was detected in Phrymaceae. Instead, small-scale duplications are among potential drivers of macroevolutionary diversification of Phrymaceae.\n\nConclusionsWe show that analysis of reticulate evolution is sensitive to taxon sampling and methods used. We also demonstrate that genome-scale data do not always fully \"resolve\" phylogenetic relationships. They present rich opportunities to investigate reticulate evolution, and gene and genome evolution involved in lineage diversification and adaptation.",

There have been no efforts to comparative study of high and low oil yielding genetically identical sandalwood trees grown in similar climatic condition. Thus we intend to study a genome wide transcriptome analysis to identify the corresponding genes involved in high oil biosynthesis in S. album. In this study, 15 years old S. album (SaSHc and SaSLc) genotypes were targeted for analysis to understand the contribution of genetic background on high oil biosynthesis in S. album. A total of 28,959187 and 25,598869 raw PE reads were generated by the Illumina sequencing. 2.12 million and 1.811 million coding sequences were obtained in respective accessions. Based on the GO terms, functional classification of the CDS 21262, & 18113 were assigned into 26 functional groups of three GO categories; (4,168; 3,641) for biological process (5,758;4,971) cellular component and (5,108;4,441) for molecular functions. Total 41,900 and 36,571 genes were functionally annotated and KEGG pathways of the DEGs resulted 213 metabolic pathways. In this, 14 pathways were involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis pathway in S. album. Among 237 cytochrome families, nine groups of cytochromes were participated in high oil biosynthesis. 16,665 differentially expressed genes were commonly detected in both the accessions (SaHc and SaSLc). The results showed that 784 genes were upregulated and 339 genes were downregulated in SaHc whilst 635 upregulated 299 downregulated in SaSLc S. album. RNA-Seq results were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Maximum Blast hits were found to be against Vitis vinifera. From this study we have identified additional number of cytochrome family in SaHc. The accessibility of a RNA-Seq for high oil yielding sandalwood accessions will have broader associations for the conservation and selection of superior elite samples/populations for further genetic improvement program.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella) is one of the leading causes of food-borne illnesses worldwide. To colonize the gastrointestinal tract, Salmonella produces multiple virulence factors that facilitate cellular invasion. Chitinases have been recently emerging as virulence factors for various pathogenic bacterial species and the Salmonella genome contains two annotated chitinases: STM0018 (chiA) and STM0233. However, the role of these chitinases during Salmonella pathogenesis is unknown. The putative chitinase STM0233 has not been studied previously and only limited data exists on ChiA. Chitinases typically hydrolyze chitin polymers, which are absent in vertebrates. However, chiA expression was detected in infection models and purified ChiA cleaved carbohydrate subunits present on mammalian surface glycoproteins, indicating a role during pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that expression of chiA and STM0233 is upregulated in the mouse gut and that both chitinases facilitate epithelial cell adhesion and invasion. Salmonella lacking both chitinases showed a 70% reduction in invasion of small intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. In a gastroenteritis mouse model, chitinase-deficient Salmonella strains were also significantly attenuated in the invasion of small intestinal tissue. This reduced invasion resulted in significantly delayed Salmonella dissemination to the spleen and the liver, but chitinases were not required for systemic survival. The invasion defect of the chitinase-deficient strain was rescued by the presence of wild-type Salmonella, suggesting that chitinases are secreted. By analyzing N-linked glycans of small intestinal cells, we identified specific N-acetylglucosamine-containing glycans as potential extracellular targets of Salmonella chitinases. This analysis also revealed differential abundance of Lewis X-containing glycans that is likely a result of host cell modulation due to the detection of Salmonella chitinases. Similar glycomic changes elicited by chitinase deficient strains indicate functional redundancy of the chitinases. Overall, our results demonstrate that Salmonella chitinases contribute to intestinal adhesion and invasion through modulation of the host glycome.\n\nAuthor SummarySalmonella Typhimurium infection is one of the leading causes of food-borne illnesses worldwide. In order for Salmonella to effectively cause disease, it has to invade the epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract. This invasion step allows Salmonella to replicate efficiently, causing further tissue damage and inflammation. In susceptible patients, Salmonella can spread past the intestines and infect peripheral organs. It is essential to fully understand the invasion mechanism used by Salmonella to design better treatments for infection. Here, we demonstrate that the two chitinases produced by Salmonella are involved in this invasion process. We show that Salmonella chitinases interact with surface glycans of intestinal epithelial cells and promote adhesion and invasion. Using a mouse infection model, we show that Salmonella chitinases are required for the invasion of the small intestine and enhance the dissemination of Salmonella to other organs. This study reveals an additional mechanism by which Salmonella invades and causes infection.",

We show the proposed model fits well with epidemiological historical data world health over a long period.

    "preprint_abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) because jointly analyzing multiple phenotypes may increase statistical power to detect genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits. Recently, many statistical methods have been developed for joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genetic association studies, including the Clustering Linear Combination (CLC) method. The CLC method works particularly well with phenotypes that have natural groupings, but due to the unknown number of clusters for a given data, the final test statistic of CLC method is the minimum p-value among all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. Therefore, a simulation procedure must be used to evaluate the p-value of the final test statistic. This makes the CLC method computationally demanding. We develop a new method called computationally efficient CLC (ceCLC) to test the association between multiple phenotypes and a genetic variant. Instead of using the minimum p-value as the test statistic in the CLC method, ceCLC uses the Cauchy combination test to combine all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. The test statistic of ceCLC approximately follows a standard Cauchy distribution, so the p-value can be obtained from the cumulative density function without the need for the simulation procedure. Through extensive simulation studies and application on the COPDGene data, the results demonstrate that the type I error rates of ceCLC are effectively controlled in different simulation settings and ceCLC either outperforms all other methods or has statistical power that is very close to the most powerful method with which it has been compared.",

While much is known about virus-host interactions that modulate viral gene expression in their mammalian host, much less is known about the interactions that involve inhibition, subversion or avoidance strategies in the mosquito host. A novel RNA-Protein interaction detection assay was used to detect proteins that directly or indirectly bind to dengue viral genomes in infected mosquito cells. Membrane-associated mosquito proteins SEC61A1 and Loquacious (Loqs) were found to be in complex with the viral RNA. Depletion analysis demonstrated that both SEC61A1 and Loqs have pro-viral functions in the dengue viral infectious cycle. Co-localization and pull-down assays showed that Loqs interacts with viral protein NS3 and both full-length and subgenomic viral RNAs. While Loqs coats the entire positive-stranded viral RNA, it binds selectively to the 3 end of the negative-strand of the viral genome. In-depth analyses showed that the absence of Loqs did not affect translation or turnover of the viral RNA but modulated viral replication. Loqs also displayed pro-viral functions for several flaviviruses in infected mosquito cells, suggesting a conserved role for Loqs in flavivirus-infected mosquito cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryThere is a wealth of information that dictates virus-host interactions in flavivirus-infected mammalian cells, yet there is only sparse information on the mechanisms that modulate viral gene expression in the mosquito host.

While ERMs drive metaphase cell rounding, the cell-cycle signals that prompt their conformational activation in mitosis are unknown11. We screened a library of small molecules using novel ERM biosensors12 and we unexpectedly found that drugs that disassemble microtubules promote ERM activation. Remarkably, cells disassemble their interphase microtubules while entering mitosis13. We further discovered that this disassembly of microtubules acts as a cell-cycle signal that directs ERM activation and metaphase cell rounding. We show that GEF-H1, a Rho-GEF inhibited by microtubule binding, acts downstream of microtubule disassembly to activate ERMs via RhoA and its kinase effector SLK. In addition, we demonstrate that GEF-H1 and Ect2, another Rho-GEF responsible for the generation of mitotic actomyosin forces6,14, act together to drive metaphase ERM activation and cell rounding.

    "preprint_abstract": "Acoustic allometry occurs when features of animal vocalisations can be predicted from body size measurements. Despite this being considered the norm, allometry sometimes breaks, resulting in species sounding smaller or larger than expected for their size. A recent hypothesis suggests that allometry-breaking mammals cluster into two groups: those with anatomical adaptations to their vocal tracts and those capable of learning new sounds (vocal learners). Here we test which mechanism is used to escape from acoustic allometry by probing vocal tract allometry in a proven mammalian vocal learner, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). We test whether vocal tract structures and body size scale allometrically in 68 young individuals. We find that both body length and body mass accurately predict vocal tract length and one tracheal dimension. Independently, body length predicts vocal fold length while body mass predicts a second tracheal dimension. All vocal tract measures are larger in weaners than in pups and some structures are sexually dimorphic within age classes. We conclude that harbour seals do comply with anatomical allometric constraints. However, allometry between body size and vocal fold length seems to emerge after puppyhood, suggesting that ontogeny may modulate the anatomy-learning distinction previously hypothesised as clear-cut. We suggest that seals, like other species producing signals that deviate from those expected from their vocal tract dimensions, may break allometry without morphological adaptations. In seals, and potentially other vocal learning mammals, advanced neural control over vocal organs may be the main mechanism for breaking acoustic allometry.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The self-other distinction is crucial in human social cognition and social interaction. Studies have found that oxytocin (OT) sharpens the self-other perceptual boundary but with mixed results. Further, little is known if the effect of OT on self-resemblance facial perception exists, especially on its neural basis. Moreover, it is unclear if OT would influence the judgment in self-other discrimination when the other is a child or an adult. In the current double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effect of OT on self-face perception at both behavioral and neural levels. We morphed participants faces and strangers faces to create four stimuli conditions. After being treated by either OT or placebo (PL), participants reported whether a morphed face resembles themselves, or was morphed with their own faces, while being scanned with fMRI. Behavioral results showed that people judged adult-morphed faces better than child-morphed faces. fMRI results showed that the OT group exhibited generally increased activities in the visual area and IFG for self-morphed faces. Such difference was more pronounced in the adult face compared to child face conditions. Multivariate fMRI analysis revealed that the OT group showed better classification between self-morphed versus other-morphed faces, indicating that OT increased self-other distinction, especially for adult faces and in the left hemisphere. Our study shows the significant effect of OT on self-referential brain processes, providing evidence for the potential OTs effect on a left hemisphere self network.",

Although there is some insight into the genes, pathways, and growth media involved in the parasitic to saprophytic growth transition, the exact determinants that govern this switch are largely unknown. In this work, we examined the growth and morphology of a novel Coccidioides posadasii strain (C. posadasii S/E) that efficiently produces spherules and endospores and persists in the parasitic life cycle at ambient CO2. We demonstrated that C. posadasii S/E remains virulent in an insect infection model. Surprisingly, under spherule-inducing conditions, C. posadasii S/E culture was found to be completely hyphal. Differential interference contrast (DIC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed unexpected cellular changes in this strain including cell wall remodeling and formation of septal pores with Woronin bodies. Our study suggests that the C. posadasii S/E strain is a useful BSL-2 model for studying the molecular factors that are active during the parasitic life cycle and the mechanisms underlying the parasitic to saprophytic growth transition - a morphological switch that can impact the pathogenicity of the organism in the host.",

    "preprint_abstract": "NK cells play a major role in the antiviral immune response, including against HIV-1. HIV patients have impaired NK cell activity with decrease in CD56dim NK cells and increase in CD56-CD16+ subset and recently it has been proposed that a population of CD56+NKG2C+KIR+CD57+ cells represents antiviral memory NK cells. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) partly restores the functional activity of this lymphocyte lineage. NK cells when interacting with their targets can gain antigens from them by the process of trogocytosis. Here we show that NK cells can obtain CCR5 and CXCR4, but barely CD4, from T cell lines by trogocytosis in vitro. By UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), we show that aviremic HIV patients have unique NK cell clusters that encompass for cells expressing CCR5, NKG2C and KIRs, but lack CD57 expression. Viremic patients have a larger proportion of CXCR4+ and CCR5+ NK cells than healthy donors (HD) and this is largely increased in CD107+ cells, suggesting a link between degranulation and trogocytosis. In agreement, UMAP identified a specific NK cell cluster in viremic HIV patients, which contains most of the CD107a+, CCR5+ and CXCR4+ cells. However, this cluster lacks NKG2C expression. Therefore, NK cells can gain CCR5 and CXCR4 by trogocytosis, which depends on degranulation.\n\nAuthor SummaryNK cells play a major role in the antiviral immune response, including against HIV-1. HIV-1 infection largely impacts NK cell lineage. However, identification of the NK cells fighting the virus and eliminating infected cells has remained elusive. By using FACs analysis and analyzing T cell markers, we identify specific NK cell subsets that have gained T cell antigen markers by trogocytosis. We show a strong association of degranulation and trogocytosis ex vivo suggesting that NK cells are eliminating or trying to eliminate HIV-1 infected cells.\n\nMoreover, we show that NK cells can obtain the HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4, but barely CD4, from T cells. Therefore, by uncovering that NK cells gain CCR5 and CXCR4 by trogocytosis we show that NK cells are actively fighting against HIV-1 infection in viremic and aviremic patients. This should help to identify why certain patients better control the virus, to develop new anti-HIV-1, NK cell-based, immunotherapies and to understand if NK cells can be a new HIV-1 reservoir.",

In addition, we used next generation sequencing to investigate the early products of recombination after cellular co-infection with different poliovirus serotypes. In independent studies we find no evidence for a role for RNA identity or structure in determining recombination junctions location. Instead, genome function and fitness are of greater importance in determining the identity of recombinant progeny.

How changes in adipocyte morphology are linked to gene expression and which cellular functions are affected remains elusive. We show that adipocyte hypertrophy is associated with transcriptomic changes using RNA-Seq data obtained from adipose tissue and size-separated adipocytes. Genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, protein biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism were down-regulated in large adipocytes while genes involved in inflammation were upregulated. For mitochondrial function, a reduction in the expression of thermogenesis related genes and estimated brown/beige adipocyte content was observed in individuals with large adipocytes. As a novel finding the total adipose tissue fatty acid composition was dependent on cell size and depot. MR spectroscopy methods for clinical scanning were developed to characterize adipocyte size and fatty acid composition in a fast and non-invasive manner. Together, the present data provides mechanistic insights on how adipocyte hypertrophy contributes to the manifestation of metabolic disease at the molecular and cellular level. MR spectroscopy was identified as a promising technique for an in-parallel assessment of adipose morphology and fatty acid composition allowing to translate our findings into an improved, non-invasive phenotyping of adipose tissue.",

As energy metabolism is involved in these processes, mitochondrial genetics and bioenergetics are of interest, though many features of Dictyostelium mitochondria differ from metazoans. A comprehensive inventory of mitochondrial proteins is critical to understanding mitochondrial processes and their involvement in various cellular pathways. Here, we utilized high-throughput multiplexed protein quantitation and homology analyses to generate a high-confidence mitochondrial protein compendium. Our proteomic approach, which utilizes quantitative mass spectrometry in combination with mathematical modeling, was validated through mitochondrial targeting sequence prediction and live-cell imaging. Our final compendium consists of 1082 proteins. Within our D. discoideum mitochondrial proteome, we identify many proteins that are not present in humans, yeasts, or the ancestral alpha-proteobacteria, which can serve as a foundation for future investigations into the unique mitochondria of Dictyostelium. Additionally, we leverage our compendium to highlight the complexity of metabolic reprogramming during starvation-induced development. Our compendium lays a foundation to investigate mitochondrial processes that are unique in protists, as well as for future studies to understand the functions of conserved mitochondrial proteins in health and diseases using D. discoideum as the model.",

Approximately half of CNL patients also have mutations in SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1). In this study, we developed models of SETBP1-mutant leukemia to understand the role that SETBP1 plays in CNL. SETBP1 mutations promote self-renewal of CSF3R-mutant hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and prevent cells from undergoing terminal differentiation. In vivo, SETBP1 mutations accelerate leukemia progression, leading to the rapid development of hepatosplenomegaly and granulocytosis. Through transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling, we found that SETBP1 enhances progenitor-associated programs--most strongly upregulating Myc and Myc target genes. This upregulation of Myc can be reversed by epigenetic modulatory drugs. In summary, we find that SETBP1 mutations promote aggressive hematopoietic cell expansion when expressed with mutant CSF3R through the upregulation of Myc-associated gene expression programs.\n\nStatement of SignificanceSETBP1 is frequently mutated in chronic neutrophilic leukemia, but its role in the biology of this disease is unclear.

To investigate the influence of the L-fucose utilization cluster on Campylobacter growth, survival and metabolism, we performed comparative genotyping and phenotyping of the C. jejuni reference isolate NCTC11168 (human isolate), C. jejuni Ca1352 (chicken meat isolate), C. jejuni Ca2426 (sheep isolate), and C. coli Ca0121 (pig manure isolate), that all possess the L-fucose utilization cluster.\n\nAll isolates showed enhanced survival and prolonged spiral cell morphology in aging cultures up to day seven in L-fucose-enriched MEM medium (MEMF) compared to MEM. HPLC analysis indicated L-fucose utilization linked to acetate, lactate, pyruvate and succinate production, confirming the activation of the L-fucose pathway in these isolates. Highest consumption of L-fucose by C. coli Ca0121, is conceivably linked to its enhanced growth performance up to day 7, reaching 9.3 log CFU/ml compared to approximately 8.3 log CFU/ml for the C. jejuni isolates. Genetic analysis of their respective L-fucose clusters revealed several differences, including a 1 bp deletion in the Cj0489 gene of C. jejuni NCTC11168, causing a frameshift in this isolate resulting in two separate genes, Cj0489 and Cj0490, while no apparent phenotype could be linked to the presumed frameshift in the NCTC11168 isolate. Additionally, we found that the L-fucose cluster of C. coli Ca0121 was most distant from C. jejuni NCTC11168, but confirmation of links to L-fucose metabolism associated phenotypic traits in C. coli versus C. jejuni isolates requires further studies.\n\nImportanceCampylobacter is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans worldwide, with increasing incidence and prevalence in recent years. The most prevalent species are Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli with 83% and 10% of all Campylobacter cases, respectively. Previously it was found that the majority of Campylobacter isolates are able to metabolize L-fucose (fuc+ isolates), a sugar that is widely present in the human gut. Putative roles for L-fucose in fuc+ C. jejuni isolates were found in growth, biofilm formation and virulence. Despite this, relatively little is known about L-fucose metabolism and the impact on growth and survival in fuc+ Campylobacter isolates. The results from our comparative genotyping and phenotyping study demonstrate that L-fucose, in both C. jejuni and C. coli fuc+ isolates, is involved in enhanced survival, prolonged spiral cell morphology and changes in the general metabolism. Possible links between phenotypes and differences in respective L-fucose gene clusters are discussed.",

Understanding the ability of animals to extract, store and use this information is an important issue in neurobiology. We used honey bees as model to study learning and memory after a differential conditioning that combines appetitive and aversive training trials. First of all, we describe an aversive conditioning paradigm that constitutes a clear opposite of the well known appetitive olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response. A neutral odour is presented paired with the bitter substance quinine. Aversive memory is evidenced later as an odour-specific impairment in appetitive conditioning. Then we tested the effect of mixing appetitive and aversive conditioning trials distributed along the same training session. Differential conditioning protocols like this were used before to study the ability to discriminate odours, however they were not focused on whether appetitive and aversive memories are formed. We found that after a differential conditioning, honey bees establish independent appetitive and aversive memories that do not interfere with each other during acquisition or storage. Finally, we moved the question forward to retrieval and memory expression to evaluate what happens when appetitive and the aversive learned odours are mixed during test. Interestingly, opposite memories compete in a way that they do not cancel each other out. Honey bees showed the ability to switch from expressing appetitive to aversive memory depending on their satiation level.",

Here, using live imaging coupled with scRNA-sequencing, we discovered that quiescent McSCs during regeneration activate a dormant embryonic neural crest transcriptional program followed by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh) 2 metabolic switch to generate progeny. Unexpectedly, while ALDH2 is well known for its aldehyde clearing mechanisms we find that in regenerating McSCs, Aldh2 activity is required to generate formate - the one-carbon (1C) building block for nucleotide biosynthesis - through formaldehyde metabolism. Consequently, we find that disrupting the 1C cycle with low-doses of methotrexate caused melanocyte regeneration defects. In the absence of Aldh2, we find that purines (but not pyrimidines) are the metabolic end product sufficient for activated McSCs to generate progeny. Together, our work reveals McSCs undergo a two-step cell state transition during regeneration, and that the reaction products of Aldh2 enzymes have tissue-specific stem cell functions that meet metabolic demands in regeneration.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTIn melanocyte regeneration, quiescent McSCs respond by re-expressing a neural crest identity, followed by an Aldh2-dependent metabolic switch to generate progeny.",

To prevent damages from the soil environment, cells in the root cap continuously turn over through balanced cell division and cell detachment at the inner and the outer cell layers, respectively. Upon displacement toward the outermost layer, columella cells at the central root cap domain functionally transition from gravity-sensing cells to secretory cells, but the mechanisms underlying this drastic cell fate transition are largely unknown. By using live-cell tracking microscopy, we here show that organelles in the outermost cell layer undergo dramatic rearrangements, and at least a part of this rearrangement depends on spatiotemporally regulated activation of autophagy. Notably, this root cap autophagy does not lead to immediate cell death, but rather is necessary for organized separation of living root cap cells, highlighting a previously undescribed role of developmentally regulated autophagy in plants.\n\nSummary statementTime-lapse microscope imaging revealed spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular reorganization associated with functional transition and cell separation in the Arabidopsis root cap and the roles of autophagy in this process.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Transposable element (TE) mobilization is a constant threat to genome integrity. Eukaryotic organisms have evolved robust defensive mechanisms to suppress their activity, yet TEs can escape suppression and proliferate, creating strong selective pressure for host defense to adapt. This genomic conflict fuels a never-ending arms race that drives the rapid evolution of TEs and recurrent positive selection of genes involved in host defense; the latter has been shown to contribute to postzygotic hybrid incompatibility. However, how TE proliferation impacts genome and regulatory divergence remains poorly understood. Here, we report the highly complete and contiguous (N50=33.8Mb - 38.0Mb) genome assemblies of seven closely-related Drosophila species that belong to the nasuta species group - a poorly studied group of flies that radiated in the last 2 million years. We constructed a high quality de novo TE library and gathered germline RNA-seq data, which allowed us to comprehensively annotate and compare insertion patterns between the species, and infer the evolutionary forces controlling their spread. We find a strong negative association between TE insertion frequency and expression of genes nearby; this likely reflects survivor-bias from reduced fitness impact of TE inserting near lowly expressed, non-essential genes, with limited TE-induced epigenetic silencing. Phylogenetic analyses of insertions of 147 TE families reveal that 53% of them show recent amplification in at least one species. The most highly amplified TE is an non-autonomous DNA element DINE which has gone through multiple bouts of expansions with thousands of full length copies littered throughout each genome. Across all TEs, we find that TEs expansions are significantly associated with high expression in the expanded species consistent with suppression escape. Altogether, our results shed light on the heterogenous and context-dependent nature in which TEs affect gene regulation and the dynamics of rampant TE proliferation amidst a recently radiated species group.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule (MT) associated protein that regulates MT structure and function during neuronal development and mutations in DCX lead to a spectrum of neurological disorders. The structural properties of MT-bound DCX remain poorly resolved. Here, we describe the molecular architecture of the DCX-MT complex through an integrative modeling approach that combines data from X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM and a high-fidelity chemical crosslinking method. We demonstrate that DCX interacts with MTs through its N-terminal domain and induces a lattice-dependent self-association involving both the C-terminal structured domain and the C-tails, in a conformation that favors an open, domain-swapped state. The networked state can accommodate multiple different attachment points on the MT lattice, all of which orient the C-tails away from the lattice. As numerous disease mutations cluster in the C-terminus, and regulatory phosphorylations cluster in the C-tail, our study shows that lattice-driven self-assembly is an important property of DCX.",

Because it is commonly assumed that blood flow velocities in these vessels are prohibitively slow, non-invasive time-of-flight MRI angiography (TOF-MRA)--which is well-suited to high 3D imaging resolutions--has not been applied to imaging the pial arteries. Here, we provide a theoretical framework that outlines how TOF-MRA can visualize small pial arteries in vivo, by employing extremely small voxels at the size of individual vessels. We then provide evidence for this theory by imaging the pial arteries at 140-{micro}m isotropic resolution using a 7T MRI scanner and prospective motion correction, and show that pial arteries one voxel-width in diameter can be detected. We conclude that imaging pial arteries is not limited by slow blood flow, but instead by achievable image resolution. This study represents the first targeted, comprehensive account of imaging pial arteries in vivo in the human brain. This ultra-high-resolution angiography will enable the characterization of pial vascular anatomy across the brain to investigate patterns of blood supply and relationships between vascular and functional architecture.",

The C. briggsae genome sequence has accelerated research by facilitating the generation of new resources, tools, and functional studies of genes. While substantial progress has been made in predicting genes and start sites, experimental evidence is still lacking in many cases. Here, we report an improved annotation of the C. briggsae genome using the Trans-spliced Exon Coupled RNA End Determination (TEC-RED) technique. In addition to identifying the 5 ends of expressed genes, we have discovered operons and paralogs. In summary, our analysis yielded 10,243 unique 5 end sequence tags with matches in the C. briggsae genome. Of these, 6,395 were found to represent 4,252 unique genes along with 362 paralogs and 52 previously unknown exons. These genes included 14 that are exclusively trans-spliced in C. briggsae when compared with C. elegans orthologs. A major contribution of this study is the identification of 493 operons, of which two-thirds are fully supported by tags. In addition, two SL1-type operons were discovered. Interestingly, comparisons with C. elegans showed that only 40% of operons are conserved. Of the remaining operons, 73 are novel, including 12 that entirely lack orthologs in C. elegans. Further analysis revealed that four of the 12 novel operons are conserved in C. nigoni. Altogether, the work described here has significantly advanced our understanding of the C. briggsae system and serves as a rich resource to aid biological studies involving this species.",

To go beyond the mapping of quantitative trait locus (QTL) in bi-parental crosses, we exploited a diverse panel of 279 Vitis vinifera L. cultivars. This panel planted in five blocks in the vineyard was phenotyped over several years for 127 traits including yield components, organic acids, aroma precursors, polyphenols, and a water stress indicator. The panel was genotyped for 63k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by combining an 18K microarray and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The experimental design allowed to reliably assess the genotypic values for most traits. Marker densification via GBS markedly increased the proportion of genetic variance explained by SNPs, and two multi-SNP models identified QTLs not found by a SNP-by-SNP model. Overall, 489 reliable QTLs were detected for 41% more response variables than by a SNP-by-SNP model with microarray-only SNPs, many new ones compared to the results from bi-parental crosses. Prediction accuracy higher than 0.42 was obtained for 50% of the response variables. Our overall approach as well as QTL and prediction results provide insights into the genetic architecture of target traits. New candidate genes and the application in breeding are discussed.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem. Caused by external mechanical forces, a major characteristic of TBI is the shearing of axons across the white matter, which causes structural connectivity disruptions between brain regions. This diffuse injury leads to cognitive deficits, frequently requiring rehabilitation. Heterogeneity is another characteristic of TBI as severity and cognitive sequelae of the disease have a wide variation across patients, posing a big challenge for treatment. Thus, measures assessing network-wide structural connectivity disruptions in TBI are necessary to quantify injury burden of individuals, which would help in achieving personalized treatment, patient monitoring, and rehabilitation planning. Despite TBI being a disconnectivity syndrome, connectomic assessment of structural disconnectivity has been very scarce. In this study, we propose a novel connectomic measure that we call network anomaly score (NAS) to capture the integrity of structural connectivity in TBI patients by leveraging two major characteristics of the disease: diffuseness of axonal injury and heterogeneity of the disease. Over a longitudinal cohort of moderate-to-severe TBI patients, we demonstrate that structural network topology of patients are more heterogeneous and are significantly different than that of healthy controls at 3 months post-injury, where dissimilarity further increases up to 12 months. We also show that NAS captures injury burden as quantified by post-traumatic amnesia and that alterations in the structural brain network is not related to cognitive recovery. Finally we compare NAS to major graph theory measures used in TBI literature and demonstrate the superiority of NAS in characterizing the disease.",

This insight was leveraged to develop mechanism of its activity and inhibition by {beta}-lactams. Here we report identification of an allosteric site at a distance of 21 [A] from the catalytic site that binds the sugar moiety of PG substrates (hereafter referred to as the S-pocket). This site also binds a second {beta}-lactam molecule and influences binding at the catalytic site. We provide evidence that two {beta}-lactam molecules bind co-operatively to this enzyme, one non-covalently at the S-site and one covalently at the catalytic site. This dual {beta}-lactam binding phenomenon is previously unknown and is an observation that may offer novel approaches for the structure-based design of new {beta}-lactam antibiotics for M. tuberculosis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Current animal-free methods to assess teratogenicity of drugs under development still deliver high numbers of false negatives, and more sensitive approaches of toxicity prediction are required. To address this issue, we characterized the TeraTox test, a newly developed multi-lineage differentiation assay for human teratogenicity prediction using 3D human induced pluripotent stem cells. TeraTox produces as primary output concentration-dependent data sets for each test compound on cytotoxicity and altered gene expression. These data are then fed into a prediction model based on an interpretable machine-learning approach. The final information obtained relates to the concentration-dependent human teratogenicity potential of drug candidates. We applied TeraTox to profile 33 approved pharmaceuticals and 12 proprietary drug candidates with known in vivo data. This way, it was possible to relate the test predictions to known human or animal toxicity. The TeraTox had an accuracy of 69% (specificity: 53%, sensitivity: 79%). It clearly performed better than two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and it had a higher sensitivity than the murine embryonic stem cell test (mEST) run in the same laboratory. By combining TeraTox and mEST data, the overall prediction accuracy was further improved. The knowledge on the pattern of altered gene expression may provide additional value in grouping toxicologically similar compounds and possibly deducing common modes of action. The assay will thus be a helpful additional tool in drug discovery, and the dataset provided here will be a valuable resource for the field of stem cell-based drug profiling.",

However, existing placement methods have a fundamental limitation: they assume that query sequences have evolved using specific models directly on the reference phylogeny. Thus, they can place single-gene data (e.g., 16S rRNA amplicons) onto their own gene tree. This practice is a proxy for a more ambitious goal: extending a (genome-wide) species tree given data from individual genes. No algorithm currently addresses this challenging problem. Here, we introduce Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP), an algorithm that learns to extend species trees using single genes without pre-specified models. We show that DEPP updates the multi-locus microbial tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further demonstrate that DEPP can achieve the long-standing goal of combining 16S and metagenomic data onto a single tree, enabling community structure analyses that were previously impossible and producing robust patterns.",

Here we consider one of the simplest confined geometries: a biofilm growing laterally in the space between a solid surface and an overlying elastic sheet.

    "preprint_abstract": "When indexing large collections of short-read sequencing data, a common operation that has now been implemented in several tools (Sequence Bloom Trees and variants, BIGSI, ..) is to construct a collection of Bloom filters, one per sample. Each Bloom filter is used to represent a set of k-mers which approximates the desired set of all the non-erroneous k-mers present in the sample. However, this approximation is imperfect, especially in the case of metagenomics data. Erroneous but abundant k-mers are wrongly included, and non-erroneous but low-abundant ones are wrongly discarded. We propose kmtricks, a novel approach for generating Bloom filters from terabase-sized collections of sequencing data. Our main contributions are 1/ an efficient method for jointly counting k-mers across multiple samples, including a streamlined Bloom filter construction by directly counting, partitioning and sorting hashes instead of k-mers, which is approximately four times faster than state-of-the-art tools; 2/ a novel technique that takes advantage of joint counting to preserve low-abundant k-mers present in several samples, improving the recovery of non-erroneous k-mers. Our experiments highlight that this technique preserves around 8x more k-mers than the usual yet crude filtering of low-abundance k-mers in a large metagenomics dataset.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/tlemane/kmtricks\n\nFundingThe work was funded by IPL Inria Neuromarkers, ANR Inception (ANR-16-CONV-0005), ANR Prairie (ANR-19-P3IA-0001), ANR SeqDigger (ANR-19-CE45-0008).",

In contrast, at the other end of the cell, the basal complex (BC) has been in the limelight since it is much less prominent and specific functions were not immediately obvious. However, in the past decade a staggering array of functions have been associated with the BC, and strides have been made in understanding its structure. Here, these collective insights are supplemented with new data to provide an overview of the understanding of the BC in Toxoplasma gondii. The emerging picture is that the BC is a dynamic and multifunctional complex, with a series of (putative) functions. The BC has multiple roles in cell division: it is the site where building blocks are added to the cytoskeleton scaffold; it exerts a two-step stretch and constriction mechanism as contractile ring; and it is key in organelle division. Furthermore, the BC has numerous putative roles in  import, such as the recycling of mother cell remnants, the acquisition of host-derived vesicles, possibly the uptake of lipids derived from the extracellular medium, and the endocytosis of micronemal proteins. The latter process ties the BC to motility, whereas an additional role in motility is conferred by Myosin C. Furthermore, the BC acts on the assembly and/or function of the intravacuolar network, which may directly or indirectly contribute to the establishment of chronic tissue cysts. Here we provide experimental support for molecules acting in several of these processes, and identify several new BC proteins critical to maintaining the cytoplasmic bridge between divided parasites. However, the dispensable nature of many BC components leaves many questions unanswered regarding its function. In conclusion, the BC in T. gondii is a dynamic and multifunctional structure at the posterior end of the parasite.",

We used five clonal common gardens containing 34 provenances (523 genotypes) of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) to determine whether models combining climatic and genomic data capture the underlying drivers of height-growth variation, and thus improve predictions at large geographical scales. The plastic component explained most of the height-growth variation, probably resulting from population responses to multiple environmental factors. The genetic component stemmed mainly from climate adaptation, and the distinct demographic and selective histories of the different maritime pine gene pools. Models combining climate-of-origin and gene pool of the provenances, and positive-effect height-associated alleles (PEAs) captured most of the genetic component of height-growth and better predicted new provenances compared to the climate-based population response functions. Regionally-selected PEAs were better predictors than globally-selected PEAs, showing high predictive ability in some environments, even when included alone in the models. These results are therefore promising for the future use of genome-based prediction of quantitative traits.",

Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.",

Anecdotal evidence has indicated that a CRE and a promoter need to be biochemically compatible for promoter regulation to occur, but this compatibility has remained poorly characterised in mammalian cells. We used high-throughput combinatorial reporter assays to test thousands of CRE - promoter pairs from three Mb-sized genomic regions in mouse cells. This revealed that CREs vary substantially in their promoter compatibility, ranging from striking specificity for a single promoter to quantitative differences in activation across a broad set of promoters. More than half of the tested CREs exhibit significant promoter selectivity. Housekeeping promoters tend to have similar CRE preferences, but other promoters exhibit a wide diversity of compatibilities. Higher-order TF motif combinations may account for compatibility. CRE-promoter selectivity does not correlate with looping interactions in the native genomic context, suggesting that chromatin folding and compatibility are two orthogonal mechanisms that confer specificity to gene regulation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "African Swine Fever (ASF) has emerged as a disease of great concern to swine producers and government disease control agencies because of its severe consequences to animal health and the pig industry. Early detection of an ASF introduction is considered essential for reducing the harm caused by the disease. Risk-based surveillance approaches have been used as enhancements to early disease epidemic detection systems in livestock populations. Such approaches may consider the role wildlife plays in hosting and transmitting a disease. In this study, a novel method is presented to estimate and map the risk of introducing ASF into the domestic pig population through wild boar intermediate hosts. It makes use of data about hunted wild boar, rest areas along motorways connecting ASF affected countries to Switzerland, outdoor piggeries, and forest cover. These data were used to compute relative wild boar abundance as well as to estimate the risk of both disease introduction into the wild boar population and disease transmission to domestic pigs. The way relative wild boar abundance was calculated adds to the current state of the art by considering the effect of beech mast on hunting success and the probability of wild boar occurrence when distributing relative abundance values among individual grid cells. The risk of ASF introduction into the domestic pig population by wild boar was highest near the borders of France, Germany, and Italy. On the north side of the Alps, areas of high risk were located on the unshielded side of the main motorway crossing the Central Plateau, which acts as a barrier for wild boar. The results of this study can be used to focus surveillance efforts for early disease detection on high risk areas. The developed method may also inform policies to control other diseases that are transmitted by direct contact from wild boar to domestic pigs.",

Since the outbreak began in March 2020, India has reported 4.77 lakh Coronavirus deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The innate RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, on the other hand, allows for the development of nucleic acid-based antiviral drugs in which complementary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of target mRNA. Therefore, in this current study, the potential of RNAi was harnessed to construct siRNA molecules that target the consensus regions of specific structural proteins associated genes of SARS-CoV-2, such as the envelope protein gene (E), membrane protein gene (M), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene (N), and surface glycoprotein gene (S) which are important for the viral pathogenesis. Conserved sequences of 811 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around India were collected to design 21 nucleotides long siRNA duplex based on various computational algorithms and parameters targeting E, M, N and S genes. The proposed siRNA molecules possessed sufficient nucleotide-based and other features for effective gene silencing and BLAST results revealed that siRNAs targets have no significant matches across the whole human genome and hence, siRNAs were found to have no off-target effects on the genome, ruling out the possibility of off-target silencing. Finally, out of 157 computationally identified siRNAs, only 4 effective siRNA molecules were selected for each target gene which is proposed to exert the best action based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature, heat capacity and molecular docking analysis with Human AGO2 protein. Our engineered siRNA candidates could be used as a genome-level therapeutic treatment against various sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains in India. However, future applications will necessitate additional validations in vitro and in vivo animal models.",

One such model is the spatial charge map (SCM) proposed by Agrawal and coworkers (mAbs. 2015, 8(1):43-48). SCM applies molecular dynamics simulations to calculate a score for the screening of antibody viscosity at high concentrations. However, molecular dynamics simulations are computationally costly and require structural information, a significant application bottleneck. In this work, high throughput computing was performed to calculate the SCM scores for 6596 nonredundant antibody variable regions. A convolutional neural network surrogate model, DeepSCM, requiring only sequence information, was then developed based on this dataset. The linear correlation coefficient of the DeepSCM and SCM scores achieved 0.9 on the test set (N=1320). The DeepSCM model was applied to screen the viscosity of 38 therapeutic antibodies that SCM correctly classified and resulted in only one misclassification. The DeepSCM model will facilitate high concentration antibody viscosity screening. The code and parameters are freely available at https://github.com/Lailabcode/DeepSCM.",

As predator communities and activity are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors on different spatial scales, the strength of top-down regulation ( arthropod predation) is also likely to vary. Understanding the combined effects of potential drivers on arthropod predation is urgently needed with regard to anthropogenic climate and land-use change. In a large-scale study, we recorded arthropod predation rates using artificial caterpillars on 113 plots of open herbaceous vegetation embedded in contrasting habitat types (forest, grassland, arable field, settlement) along climate and land-use gradients in Bavaria, Germany. As potential drivers we included habitat characteristics (habitat type, plant species richness, local mean temperature and mean relative humidity during artificial caterpillar exposure), landscape diversity (0.5-3.0-km, six scales), climate (multi-annual mean temperature,  MAT) and interactive effects of habitat type with other drivers. We observed no substantial differences in arthropod predation rates between the studied habitat types, related to plant species richness and across the Bavarian-wide climatic gradient, but predation was limited when local mean temperatures were low and tended to decrease towards higher relative humidity. Arthropod predation rates increased towards more diverse landscapes at a 2-km scale. Interactive effects of habitat type with local weather conditions, plant species richness, landscape diversity and MAT were not observed. We conclude that landscape diversity favours high arthropod predation rates in open herbaceous vegetation independent of the dominant habitat in the vicinity. This finding may be harnessed to improve top-down control of herbivores, e.g. agricultural pests, but further research is needed for more specific recommendations on landscape management. The absence of MAT effects suggests that high predation rates may occur independent of moderate increases of MAT in the near future.",

As validation, we show that Analyze_Blebs can detect significant differences in cell migration and morphometrics, such as the largest bleb size, upon introducing different live markers of F-actin, including F-tractin and LifeAct tagged with green and red fluorescent proteins. We also demonstrate, using flow cytometry, that live markers increase total levels of F-actin. Furthermore, that F-tractin increases cell stiffness, which was found to correlate with a decrease in migration, thus reaffirming the importance of cell mechanics as a determinant of Leader Bleb-Based Migration (LBBM).\n\nHighlight summaryA new plugin, Analyze_Blebs, enables the rapid analysis of cell migration and morphometrics of fast amoeboid cells.

Epigenetic control of the genome also governs T cell transcriptome and T cell lineage commitment and maintenance. Cellular metabolic programs interact with epigenetic regulation by providing substrates for covalent modifications of chromatin. By employing complementary genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic approaches, we revealed that tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux fuels biosynthetic processes while controlling the ratio of -ketoglutarate/succinate to modulate the activities of dioxygenases that are critical for driving T cell inflammation. In contrast to cancer cells, where succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)/complex II inactivation drives cell transformation and growth, SDH/complex II deficiency in T cells causes proliferation and survival defects when the TCA cycle is truncated, blocking carbon flux to support nucleosides biosynthesis. Accordingly, replenishing the intracellular nucleoside pool partially relieved the dependence of T cells on SDH/complex II for proliferation and survival. Conversely, SDH deficiency induces a pro-inflammatory gene signature in T cells and promotes T helper 1 (TH1) and T helper 17 (TH17) lineage differentiation. Mechanistically, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is not required for succinate-induced inflammation in T cells. A reduced -ketoglutarate/succinate ratio in SDH deficient T cells promotes inflammation through changing the pattern of the transcriptional and chromatin-accessibility signatures and consequentially increasing the expression of the transcription factor, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1). Collectively, our studies revealed a critical role of SDH/complex II in allocating carbon resources for anabolic processes and epigenetic regulation in T cell proliferation and inflammation.",

While both coding and non-coding DNA variants contribute to a wide range of diseases, most patients who receive a WGS-based diagnosis today harbour a protein-coding mutation. Functional interpretation and prioritization of non-coding variants represents a persistent challenge, and disease-causing non-coding variants remain largely unidentified. Depending on the disease, WGS fails to identify a candidate variant in 20-80% of patients, severely limiting the usefulness of sequencing for personalised medicine. Here we present FINSURF, a machine-learning approach to predict the functional impact of non-coding variants in regulatory regions. FINSURF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, owing to control optimisation during training. In addition to ranking candidate variants, FINSURF also delivers diagnostic information on functional consequences of mutations. We applied FINSURF to a diverse set of 30 diseases with described causative non-coding mutations, and correctly identified the disease-causative non-coding variant within the ten top hits in 22 cases. FINSURF is implemented as an online server to as well as custom browser tracks, and provides a quick and efficient solution to prioritize candidate non-coding variants in realistic clinical settings.",

We extracted single-unit and population-level correlates of task features, and found value-independent coding for the context cues.

Kaposis sarcoma associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is a defined oncogenic virus belonging to the sub-family of human gamma-herpesviruses.

In our studies, we identified that polyamine biosynthesis and eIF5A hypusination are dynamically regulated by KSHV infection likely through the modulation of key enzymes of these pathways, such as ODC1, and that in return these metabolic pathways are required for both KSHV lytic switch from latency and de novo infection. The further analysis unraveled that translation of critical KSHV latent and lytic proteins (LANA, RTA) depends on eIF5A hypusination. We also demonstrated that KSHV infection can be efficiently and specifically suppressed by using inhibitors targeting either polyamine biosynthesis or eIF5A hypusination. Above all, our results illustrated that the dynamic and profound interaction of a DNA tumor virus (KSHV) with host polyamine biosynthesis and eIF5A hypusination metabolic pathways promote viral propagation and oncogenesis, which serve as new therapeutic targets to treat KSHV-associated malignancies.",

Glycosylation is known to play a role in immunity and inflammation, but the role of glycans in sepsis is not well defined. Herein, we profiled the serum glycomes of experimental mouse sepsis models to identify changes induced by 4 different clinical bacterial pathogens (Gram-positive: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative: Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium) using our lectin microarray technology. We observed global shifts in the blood sera glycome that were conserved across all four species, regardless of whether they were Gram positive or negative. Bisecting GlcNAc was decreased upon sepsis and a strong increase in core 1/3 O-glycans was observed. Lectin blot analysis revealed a high molecular weight protein induced in sepsis by all four bacteria as the major cause of the core 1/3 O-glycan shift.

    "preprint_abstract": "The alpha subunit of the cytoplasmic Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase (-PheRS, FARSA in humans) displays cell growth and proliferation activities and its elevated levels can induce cell fate changes and tumor-like phenotypes that do neither dependent on the canonical function of charging tRNAPhe with phenylalanine nor on stimulating general translation. In intestinal stem cells of Drosophila midguts, -PheRS levels are naturally slightly elevated and human FARSA mRNA levels are elevated in multiple cancers. In the Drosophila midgut model, elevated -PheRS levels caused the accumulation of many additional proliferating cells resembling intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enteroblasts (EBs). This phenotype resembles partially the tumor-like phenotype described as Notch RNAi phenotype for the same cells. Genetic interactions between -PheRS and Notch suggest that their activities neutralize each other and that elevated -PheRS levels attenuate Notch signaling whether Notch induces differentiation into enterocytes, neuroblast stem cell proliferation, or transcription of a Notch reporter. These non-canonical functions all map to the N-terminal part of -PheRS which accumulates naturally in the intestine. This truncated version of -PheRS (-S) also localizes to nuclei and displays weak sequence similarity to the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), suggesting that -S might compete with the NICD for binding to a common target. Supporting this hypothesis, the tryptophan (W) residue reported to be key for the interaction between the NICD and the Su(H) BTD domain is not only conserved in -PheRS and -S, but also essential for attenuating Notch signaling.\n\nAuthor SummaryAminoacyl tRNA synthetases charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acid to ensure proper decoding of the genetic code during translation. Independent of its aminoacylation function, the alpha subunit of Drosophila cytoplasmic Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase (-PheRS, FARSA in humans) has an additional activity that promotes growth and proliferation (Ho et al., 2021). Here we describe that elevated -PheRS levels also induce cell fate changes and tumorous phenotypes in Drosophila midguts. Excessive proliferating cells with stem and progenitor cell characteristics accumulate and the composition of the terminally differentiated cells changes, too. This phenotype together with observed genetic interactions between -PheRS and Notch levels show that -PheRS counteracts Notch signaling in many different tissues and developmental stages. This novel activity of -PheRS maps to its N-terminal part, which is naturally produced. The fragment contains a DNA binding domain, translocates into nuclei, and displays essential similarities to a Notch domain that binds to the downstream transcription factor. This suggests that it might be competing with Notch for binding to a common target. Not only because Notch plays important roles in many tumors, but also because FARSA mRNA levels are considerably upregulated in many tumors, this novel activity deserves more attention for cancer research.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The capacity of humoral B cell-mediated immunity to effectively respond to and protect against pathogenic infections is largely driven by the presence of a diverse repertoire of polyclonal antibodies in the serum, which are produced by plasma cells (PCs).1,2 Recent studies have started to reveal the balance between deterministic mechanisms and stochasticity of antibody repertoires on a genotypic level (i.e., clonal diversity, somatic hypermutation, germline gene usage).3-8 However, it remains unclear if clonal selection and expansion of PCs follows any deterministic rules or is stochastic with regards to phenotypic antibody properties (i.e., antigen-binding, affinity, epitope specificity). Here we report on the in-depth genotypic and phenotypic characterization of clonally expanded PC antibody repertoires following protein immunization. We find that there is only a strong correlation with antigen-specificity among the most expanded clones (top ~ 10), whereas among the rest of the clonal repertoire antigen-specificity is stochastic. Furthermore, we report both on a polyclonal repertoire and clonal lineage level that antibody-antigen binding affinity does not correlate with clonal expansion or somatic hypermutation. Lastly, we provide evidence for convergence towards dominant epitopes despite clonal sequence diversity among the most expanded clones. Our results highlight the extent to which clonal expansion can be ascribed to antigen binding, affinity and epitope specificity and they have implications for the assessment of effective vaccines.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/452687v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e907c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fc45b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@44bd91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f98f3e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "Sequence simulators are fundamental tools in bioinformatics, as they allow us to test data processing and inference tools, as well as being part of some inference methods. The ongoing surge in available sequence data is however testing the limits of our bioinformatics software. One example is the large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, which are beyond the processing power of many methods, and simulating such large datasets is also proving difficult. Here we present a new algorithm and software for efficiently simulating sequence evolution along extremely large trees (e.g. < 100, 000 tips) when the branches of the tree are short, as is typical in genomic epidemiology. Our algorithm is based on the Gillespie approach, and implements an efficient multi-layered search tree structure that provides high computational efficiency by taking advantage of the fact that only a small proportion of the genome is likely to mutate at each branch of the considered phylogeny. Our open source software is available from https://github.com/NicolaDM/phastSim and allows easy integration with other Python packages as well as a variety of evolutionary models, including indel models and new hypermutatability models that we developed to more realistically represent SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution.\n\nAuthor summaryOne of the most influential responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been the widespread adoption of genome sequencing to keep track of viral spread and evolution. This has resulted in vast availability of genomic sequence data, that, while extremely useful and promising, is also increasingly hard to store and process efficiently. An important task in the processing of this genetic data is simulation, that is, recreating potential histories of past and future virus evolution, to benchmark data analysis methods and make statistical inference. Here, we address the problem of efficiently simulating large numbers of closely related genomes, similar to those sequenced during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or indeed to most scenarios in genomic epidemiology. We develop a new algorithm to perform this task, that provides not only computational efficiency, but also extreme flexibility in terms of possible evolutionary models, allowing variation in mutation rates, non-stationary evolution, and indels; all phenomena that play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, as well as many other real-life epidemiological scenarios.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Over 100 years, Fitness landscapes have been a powerful metaphor for understanding the evolution of biological systems. These landscapes describe how genotypes are connected to each other and are related according to relative fitness. Despite the high dimensionality of such real-world landscapes, empirical studies are often limited in their ability to quantify the fitness of different genotypes beyond point mutations, while theoretical works attempt statistical/mechanistic models to reason the overall landscape structure. However, most classical fitness landscape models overlook an instinctive constraint that genotypes leading to the same phenotype almost certainly share the same fitness value, since the information of genotype-phenotype mapping is rarely incorporated. Here, we investigate fitness landscape models through the lens of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), where the regulatory products are computed from multiple genes and collectively treated as the phenotypes. With the assumption that regulatory mediators/products exhibit binary states, we prove topographical features of GRN fitness landscape models such as accessibility and connectivity insensitive to the choice of the fitness function. Furthermore, using graph theory, we deduce a mesoscopic structure underlying GRN fitness landscape models that retains necessary information for evolutionary dynamics with minimal complexity. We also propose an algorithm to construct such a mesoscopic backbone which is more efficient than the brute-force approach. Combined, this work provides mathematical implications for fitness landscape models with high-dimensional genotype-phenotype mapping, yielding the potential to elucidate empirical landscapes and their resulting evolutionary processes in a manner complementary to existing computational studies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "How a system generates conscious experience remains an elusive question. One approach towards answering this is to consider the information available in the system from the perspective of the system itself. Integrated information theory (IIT) proposes a measure to capture this, integrated information ({Phi}). While {Phi} can be computed at any spatiotemporal scale, IIT posits that it be applied at the scale at which the measure is maximised. Importantly, {Phi} should emerge to be maximal not at the smallest spatiotemporal scale, but at some macro scale where system elements or timesteps are grouped into larger elements or timesteps. Emergence in this sense has been demonstrated in artificial binary systems, but it remains unclear whether it occurs in real neural recordings which are generally continuous and noisy. Here we first utilise a computational model to confirm that {Phi} becomes maximal at the temporal scales underlying its generative mechanisms. Second, we search for emergence in local field potentials from the fly brain recorded during wakefulness and anaesthesia, finding that normalised {Phi} (wake/anaesthesia), but not raw {Phi} values, peaks at 5 ms. Lastly, we extend our model to investigate why raw {Phi} values themselves did not peak. This work extends the application of {Phi} to simple artificial systems consisting of logic gates towards searching for emergence of a macro spatiotemporal scale in real neural systems.",

Key progress in understanding the mechanisms of DR, and ageing more generally, was made when dietary protein, and more specifically essential amino acids (EAA), were identified as the key dietary component to restrict to obtain DRs health and lifespan benefits. This role of dietary amino acids has strongly influenced work on ageing mechanisms, especially in nutrient sensing, e.g. Tor and insulin(-like) signalling networks. Experimental biology in Drosophila melanogaster has been instrumental in generating and confirming the now dominant hypothesis that EAA availability is central to ageing. Here, we expand on previous work testing the involvement of EAA in DR through large scale (N=6,238) supplementation experiments across four diets and two genotypes in female flies. Surprisingly, we find that EAA are not essential to DRs lifespan benefits. Importantly, we do identify the fecundity benefits of EAA supplementation suggesting the supplemented EAA were bioavailable. Furthermore, we find that the effects of amino acids on lifespan vary by diet and genetic line studied and that at our most restricted diet fecundity is constrained by other nutrients than EAA. We suggest that DR for optimal health is a concert of nutritional effects, orchestrated by genetic, diet and environmental interactions. Our results question the universal importance of amino acid availability in the biology of ageing and DR.",

Accurate segregation requires the alignment of all chromosomes by the mitotic spindle at the metaphase plate, and any misalignment must be corrected before anaphase is triggered. The spindle is situated in a membrane-free \"exclusion zone\", beyond this zone, endomembranes (endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope and other organelles) are densely packed. We asked what happens to misaligned chromosomes that find themselves beyond the exclusion zone? Here we show that such chromosomes become ensheathed in multiple layers of endomembranes. Chromosome ensheathing delays mitosis and increases the frequency of chromosome missegregation. The micronuclei that form following missegregation have a disrupted nuclear envelope with internal endomembranes. We use an induced organelle relocalization strategy in live cells to show that clearance of endomembranes allows for the rescue of chromosomes that were destined for missegregation. Our findings indicate that endomembranes promote the missegregation of misaligned chromosomes that are outside the exclusion zone, and therefore constitute a risk factor for aneuploidy.",

Recently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is characterized by low platelet counts, clot formation at unusual anatomic sites and platelet-activating PF4-polyanion antibodies reminiscent of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Here, we employ in vitro and in vivo models to characterize the possible mechanisms of this platelet-targeted autoimmunity. We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. After intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and platelet remnants are found in the marginal zone and follicles. This is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets. Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.",

So far, it has been difficult to establish state-of-the-art human stem cell derived in vitro models that mimic physiological barrier properties including a 3D microvasculature in a format that is scalable enough to screen drugs for BBB penetration in early drug development phases. To address this challenge, we established human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain endothelial microvessels in a standardized and scalable multi-well plate format. iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were supplemented with primary cell conditioned media and grew to intact microvessels in 10 days of culturing. Produced microvessels show a typical BBB phenotype including endothelial protein expression, tight-junctions and polarized localization of efflux transporter. Microvessels exhibited physiological relevant trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), were leak-tight for 10 kDa dextran-Alexa 647 and strongly limited the permeability of sodium fluorescein (NaF). Permeability tests with reference compounds confirmed the suitability of our model as platform to identify potential BBB penetrating anti-inflammatory drugs. In summary, the here presented brain microvessel platform recapitulates physiological properties and allows rapid screening of BBB permeable anti-inflammatory compounds that has been suggested as promising substances to cure so far untreatable neurodegenerative diseases.",

Several ecological factors have been shown to modulate the optimal virulence strategies predicted from mechanistic trade-off models, but these ecological factors have not yet been shown to be sufficient to explain the intermediate virulence strategies observed in any natural system. The timing of seasonal activity, or phenology, is a common factor that influences the types and impact of many ecological interactions but is difficult to incorporate into virulence evolution studies. We develop a mathematical model of a disease system with seasonal host activity to study the evolutionary consequences of host phenology on the virulence of obligate-killer parasite. Results from this model demonstrated that seasonal host activity is sufficient to drive the evolution of intermediate parasite virulence in some types of natural disease systems, even when a traditional mechanistic trade-off between transmission and virulence is not assumed in the modeling framework. The optimal virulence strategy in these systems can be determined by both the duration of the host activity period as well as the variation in the host emergence timing. Parasites with low virulence strategies are favored in environments with long host activity periods and in environments in which hosts emerge synchronously. The results demonstrate that host phenology can be sufficient to select for intermediate optimal virulence strategies, providing an alternative mechanism to account for virulence evolution in some natural systems.",

In the current study, we elucidate a role for NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (NDR1) by exploiting effector-triggered immunity (ETI) to define the regulation of plant host immunity in response to both pathogen infection and elevated temperature. We generated time-series RNA sequencing data of WT Col-0, a NDR1 overexpression line, as well as ndr1 and ics1-2 mutant plants under elevated temperature. Not surprisingly, the NDR1-overexpression line showed genotype-specific gene expression changes related to defense response and immune system function. Interestingly, overexpression of NDR1 revealed a role for NDR1 in immune system function; specifically, we describe a mechanism that intersects with Pseudomonas syringae, type-III effector translocation, R-protein signaling complex stabilization, and sustained levels of SA at elevated temperature during ETI. The results described herein support a role for NDR1 in maintaining cell signaling during simultaneous exposure to elevated temperature and avirulent pathogen stressors.\n\nOne-sentence summaryNDR1 is required for Pst-AvrRpt2 triggered ETI at elevated temperature.",

Furthermore, we analyzed how resting-state functional connectivity evolved across learning, consolidation, and retrieval of this task using a data-driven approach. Our results show task-related connectivity changes in the executive control network, the default mode network, and the hippocampal network at post-task rest. The hippocampal network could further be divided into two subnetworks of which only one showed modulation by sleep. Decreased functional connectivity in this subnetwork was associated with higher spindle-slow oscillation coupling power, which was also related to better memory performance at test.

    "preprint_abstract": "The ligand-sensing transcription factor Nurr1 emerges as a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative pathologies but Nurr1 ligands for functional studies and therapeutic validation are lacking. Here we report pronounced Nurr1 modulation by statins for which clinically relevant neuroprotective effects have been demonstrated. Several statins directly affected Nurr1 activity in cellular and cell-free settings with low micromolar to sub-micromolar potencies. Simvastatin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in astrocytes which were abrogated by Nurr1 knockdown. Differential gene expression analysis in native and Nurr1 silenced cells revealed strong proinflammatory effects of Nurr1 knockdown while simvastatin treatment induced several neuroprotective mechanisms via Nurr1, for example, in energy utilization and reduced apoptosis. These findings suggest Nurr1 involvement in the well-documented but mechanistically elusive neuroprotection by statins.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Implant failure due to fretting corrosion at the head-stem modular junction is an increasing problem in modular total hip arthroplasty. The effect of varying microgroove topography on modular junction contact mechanics has not been well characterized. The aim of this work was to employ a novel, microgrooved finite element (FEA) model of the hip taper interface and assess the role of microgroove geometry and taper mismatch angle on the modular junction mechanics during assembly. A two-dimensional, axisymmetric FEA model was created using a modern 12/14 taper design of a CoCrMo femoral head taper and Ti6Al4V stem taper. Microgrooves were modelled at the contacting interface of the tapers and varied based on height and spacing measurements obtained from a repository of measured retrievals. Additionally, taper angular mismatch between the head and stem was varied to simulate proximal- and distal-locked engagement. Forty simulations were conducted to parametrically evaluate the effects of microgroove surface topography and angular mismatch on predicted contact area, contact pressure, and equivalent plastic strain. Multiple linear regression analysis was highly significant (p < 0.001; R2 > 0.74) for all outcome variables. The regression analysis identified microgroove geometry on the head taper to have the greatest influence on modular junction contact mechanics. Additionally, there was a significant second order relationship between both peak contact pressure (p < 0.001) and plastic strain (p < 0.001) with taper mismatch angle. These modeling techniques will be used to identify the implant parameters that maximize taper interference strength via large in-silico parametric studies.",

Most of the bioinformatic tools are designed for plants or animals but fungal miRNAs processing and expression share similarities and differences with both kingdoms. Moreover, since mushroom species such as Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom) are frequently consumed as food, controversial discussions are still evaluating whether their miRNAs might or might not be assimilated, perhaps within extracellular vesicles (i.e exosomes). Therefore, the A. bisporus RNA-seq was studied in order to identify potential de novo miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) that might allow their later detection in the diet. Results pointed to 1 already known and 37 de novo milRNAss. Three milRNAss were selected for RT-qPCR experiments. Precursors and mature milRNAs were found in the edible parts (caps and stipes) validating the predictions carried out in silico. When their potential gene targets were investigated, results pointed that mostly were involved in primary and secondary metabolic regulation. However, when human transcriptome is used as target, the results suggest that they might interfere with important biological processes related with cancer, infectious process and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Flies survives the winter by entering a state of reproductive arrest (diapause), which drives relocation of resources from reproduction to survival. Here, we profiled the expression of microRNA (miRNA) in long and short photoperiods and identified seven differentially expressed miRNAs (dme-mir-2b, dme-mir-11, dme-mir-34, dme-mir-274, dme-mir-184, dme-mir-184* and dme-mir-285). Misexpression of dme-mir-2b, dme-mir-184 and dme-mir-274 in pigment-dispersing factor-expressing neurons largely disrupted the normal photoperiodic response, suggesting that these miRNAs play functional roles in photoperiodic timing. We also analyzed the targets of photoperiodic miRNA by both computational predication and by Argonaute-1- mediated immunoprecipitation of long- and short-day RNA samples. Together with global transcriptome profiling, our results expand existing data on other Drosophila species, identifying genes and pathways that are differentially regulated in different photoperiods and reproductive status. Our data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNA is an important facet of photoperiodic timing.",

They have been also entrusted with other, although less defined, functions such as the regulation of the angiotensin system and blood pressure. In humans, ERAP1 and IRAP are commonly expressed. ERAP2 instead has evolved under balancing selection that maintains two haplotypes one of which undergoing RNA splicing leading to nonsense-mediated decay and loss of protein. Hence, likewise in rodents in which the ERAP2 gene is missing, about a quarter of the human population does not express ERAP2. We report here that macrophages, but not monocytes or other mononuclear blood cells, express and secrete an ERAP2 shorter form independently from the haplotype. The generation of this \"short\" ERAP2 is due to an autocatalytic cleavage within a distinctive structural motif and requires an acidic microenvironment. Remarkably, ERAP2 \"short\" binds IRAP and the two molecules are co-expressed in the endosomes as well as in the cell membrane. Of note, the same phenomenon could be observed in some cancer cells. These data prompt to reconsider the role of ERAP2 which might have been maintained in humans because fulfilling a relevant function as \"short\" form in specialized cells.",

However, the effects of explosive speciation on species interactions remain poorly understood. Metazoan parasites infecting radiating host lineages could improve our knowledge because of their intimate host relationships. Yet limited molecular, phenotypic, and ecological data discourage multivariate analyses of evolutionary patterns and encourage the use of discrete characters. Here, we assemble new molecular, morphological, and host range data widely inferred from a species-rich lineage of parasites (Cichlidogyrus, Platyhelminthes: Monogenea) infecting cichlid fishes to address data scarcity. We infer a multi-marker (28S/18S rDNA, ITS1, COI mtDNA) phylogeny of 58/137 species and characterise major lineages through synapomorphies inferred from mapping morphological characters. We predict the phylogenetic position of species without DNA data through shared character states, a combined molecular-morphological phylogenetic analysis, and a classification analysis with support vector machines. Based on these predictions and a cluster analysis, we assess the systematic informativeness of continuous characters, search for continuous equivalents for discrete characters, and suggest new characters for morphological traits not analysed to date. We also model the attachment/reproductive organ and host range evolution using the data of 136/137 described species and multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs). We show that discrete characters can mask phylogenetic signals but can be key for characterising species groups. Regarding the attachment organ morphology, a divergent evolutionary regime for at least one lineage was detected and a limited morphological variation indicates host and environmental parameters affecting its evolution. However, moderate success in predicting phylogenetic positions, and a low systematic informativeness and high multicollinearity of morphological characters call for a revaluation of characters included in species characterisations.",

Through the augmentation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding by conjugation of the ureidopyrimidinone unit to tendon-derived gelatin, the sol-gel transition behavior of gelatin was supramolecularly-controlled, which provided a hotmelt tissue adhesive that dissolves upon warming over 40 {degrees}C and glues at 37 {degrees}C. This functionalization improved the key features necessary for an anti-adhesive barrier, including bulk mechanical strength, tissue adhesive properties, underwater stability, and anti-adhesive property.

Newly engineered AAVs with improved abilities are now entering the clinic. It has proven challenging, however, to predict the translational potential of gene therapies developed in animal models, due to cross-species differences. Human retinal explants are the only available model of fully developed human retinal tissue, and are thus important for the validation of candidate AAV vectors. In this study, we evaluated 18 wildtype and engineered AAV capsids in human retinal explants using a recently developed single-cell RNA-Seq AAV engineering pipeline (scAAVengr). Human retinal explants retained the same major cell types as fresh retina, with similar expression of cell-specific markers, except for a cone population with altered expression of cone-specific genes. The efficiency and tropism of AAVs in human explants were quantified, with single-cell resolution. The top performing serotypes, K91, K912, and 7m8, were further validated in non-human primate and human retinal explants. Together, this study provides detailed information about the transcriptome profiles of retinal explants, and quantifies the infectivity of leading AAV serotypes in human retina, accelerating the translation of retinal gene therapies to the clinic.\n\nGraphic abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/461256v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e110ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a2c7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15f1633org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa741a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The goal of FDG-fPET is to maintain a constant plasma supply of radioactive FDG in order to track, with high temporal resolution, the dynamic uptake of glucose during neuronal activity that occurs in response to a task or at rest. FDG-fPET has most often been applied in simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET (blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI fluorodeoxyglucose functional positron emission tomography) imaging. BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET provides the capability to image the two primary sources of energetic dynamics in the brain, the cerebrovascular haemodynamic response and cerebral glucose uptake.\n\nFindingsIn this Data Note, we describe an open access dataset, Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI, which contrasts three radiotracer administration protocols for FDG-fPET: bolus, constant infusion, and hybrid bolus/infusion. Participants (n=5 in each group) were randomly assigned to each radiotracer administration protocol and underwent simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET scanning while viewing a flickering checkerboard. The Bolus group received the full FDG dose in a standard bolus administration; the Infusion group received the full FDG dose as a slow infusion over the duration of the scan, and the Bolus-Infusion group received 50% of the FDG dose as bolus and 50% as constant infusion. We validate the dataset by contrasting plasma radioactivity, grey matter mean uptake, and task-related activity in the visual cortex.\n\nConclusionsThe Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI dataset provides significant re-use value for researchers interested in the comparison of signal dynamics in fPET, and its relationship with fMRI task-evoked activity.",

A high-quality reference genome sequence of E. glaucum offers a vital genomic resource for functional and evolutionary studies of Ensete, the Musaceae, and more widely in the Zingiberales.\n\nFindingsUsing a combination of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and RNA survey sequence, we report a high-quality assembly of the 481.5Mb genome with 9 pseudochromosomes and 36,836 genes (BUSCO 94.7%). A total of 55% of the genome is composed of repetitive sequences with LTR-retroelements (37%) and DNA transposons (7%) predominant. The 5S and 45S rDNA were each present at one locus, and the 5S rDNA had an exceptionally long monomer length of c.1,056 bp, contrasting with the c. 450 bp monomer at multiple loci in Musa. A tandemly repeated c. 134 bp satellite, 1.1% of the genome (with no similar sequence in Musa), was present around all nine centromeres, with a LINE retroelement also found at Musa centromeres. The assembly, including centromeric positions, enabled us to characterize in detail the chromosomal rearrangements occurring between the x = 9 species and x = 11 species of Musa. Only one chromosome has the same gene content as M. acuminata (ma). Three ma chromosomes represent part of only one E. glaucum (eg) chromosome, while the remaining seven ma chromosomes are fusions of parts of two, three, or four eg chromosomes, demonstrating complex and multiple evolutionary rearrangements in the change between x = 9 and x = 11.\n\nConclusionsThe advance towards a Musaceae pangenome including E. glaucum, tolerant of extreme environments, makes a complete set of gene alleles available for crop breeding and understanding environmental responses. The chromosome-scale genome assembly show how chromosome number evolves, and features of the rapid evolution of repetitive sequences.",

Conversely, successful motor inhibition is associated with increased beta power in a fronto-basal-ganglia network. Intriguingly, gamma activity also increases in response to a stop-signal. In this study, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation to drive beta and gamma oscillations to investigate whether these frequencies are causally related to motor inhibition. We found that 20Hz stimulation targeted at the pre-supplementary motor area enhanced inhibition and increased beta oscillatory activity around the time of the stop-signal in trials directly following stimulation. In contrast, 70Hz stimulation seemed to slow down the braking process, and predominantly affected go task performance. These results demonstrate that the effects of tACS are state-dependent and that especially fronto-central beta activity is a functional marker for successful motor inhibition.",

To study this problem, we recruited 50 human participants (Nyounger = 26, ages 18-34; Nolder = 24, ages 63-80) to play an economic trust game as the investor with three partners (friend, stranger, and computer) who played the role of investee. Investors underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the trust game while investees were seated outside of the scanner. Building on our previous work with younger adults showing both enhanced striatal responses and altered default-mode network (DMN) connectivity as a function of social closeness during reciprocated trust, we predicted that these relations would exhibit age-related differences. We found that striatal responses to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers were blunted in older adults relative to younger adults, thus supporting our primary pre-registered hypothesis regarding social closeness. We also found that older adults exhibited enhanced DMN connectivity with the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during reciprocated trust from friends compared to computers while younger adults exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of age-related differences in sensitivity to social closeness in the context of trusting others.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Histone chaperones regulate all aspects of histone metabolism. NASP is a major histone chaperone for H3-H4 dimers critical for preventing histone degradation. Here, we identify two distinct histone binding modes of NASP and reveal how they cooperate to ensure histone H3-H4 supply. We determine the structures of a sNASP dimer, a complex of sNASP with an H3 3 peptide, and the sNASP-H3-H4-ASF1b co-chaperone complex. This captures distinct functionalities of NASP and identifies two distinct binding modes involving the H3 3 helix and the H3 N region, respectively. Functional studies demonstrate the H3 N-interaction represents the major binding mode of NASP in cells and shielding of the H3 N region by NASP is essential in maintaining the H3-H4 histone soluble pool. In conclusion, our studies uncover the molecular basis of NASP as a major H3-H4 chaperone in guarding histone homeostasis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography provides detailed views of macromolecules in situ. However, imaging a large field of view to provide more cellular context requires reducing magnification during data collection, which in turn restricts the resolution. To circumvent this trade-off between field of view and resolution, we have developed a montage data collection scheme that uniformly distributes the dose throughout the specimen. In this approach, sets of slightly overlapping circular tiles are collected at high magnification and stitched to form a composite projection image at each tilt angle. These montage tilt-series are then reconstructed into massive tomograms with a small pixel size but a large field of view. For proof-of-principle, we applied this method to the thin edge of HeLa cells. Thon rings to better than 15 [A] were observed in the montaged tilt-series, and diverse cellular features were evident in the resulting tomograms. These results indicate that the additional dose required by this technique is not prohibitive to performing structural analysis to intermediate resolution across a large field of view. We anticipate that montage tomography will prove particularly useful for lamellae, increase the likelihood of imaging rare cellular events, and facilitate visual proteomics.",

We propose that individuals with a more robust response to damage-activated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and increased Toll-like receptor (TLR9) expression are predisposed to the neoplastic complications of Helicobacter infection.\n\nMethodsA mouse or human Transwell co-culture system comprised of dendritic cells (DCs), 2-dimensional gastric epithelial monolayers and Helicobacter were used to dissect the cellular source of interferon (IFN) in the stomach by flow cytometry. Conditioned media from the cocultures polarized primary myeloid cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) activity was determined by T cell suppression assays. In human subjects with intestinal metaplasia or gastric cancer, the rs5743836 TLR9T>C variant was genotyped and linked to TLR9, IFN and SLFN12L expression by immunohistochemistry. NF{kappa}B binding to the TLR9 C allele was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.\n\nResultsHelicobacter infection induced gastric epithelial and plasmacytoid DC expression of TLR9 and IFN. Co-culturing primary mouse or human cells with DCs and Helicobacter induced TLR9, IFN secretion and SLFN+-MDSC polarization. Neutralizing IFN in vivo mitigated Helicobacter-induced SPEM. The TLR9 minor C allele creates an NF{kappa}b binding site associated with higher levels of TLR9, IFN and SLFN12L in Helicobacter-infected stomachs that correlated with a greater incidence of metaplasias and cancer.\n\nConclusionTLR9 plays an essential role in the production of IFN and polarization of SLFN+-MDSCs upon Helicobacter infection. Subjects carrying the rs5743836 TLR9 minor C allele are predisposed to neoplastic complications if chronically infected.",

Aberrant activation or suppression of WNT signaling contributes to cancer initiation and progression, developmental disorders, neurodegeneration, and bone disease. Despite great need and more than 40 years of research, targeted therapies for the WNT pathway have yet to be fully realized. Kinases are exceptionally druggable and occupy key nodes within the WNT signaling network, but several pathway-relevant kinases remain understudied and  dark. Here we studied the function of the CSNK1{gamma} subfamily of human kinases. miniTurbo-based proximity biotinylation and mass spectrometry analysis of CSNK1{gamma}1, CSNK1{gamma}2, and CSNK1{gamma}3 revealed numerous established components of the {beta}-catenin- dependent and independent WNT signaling pathway, as well as novel interactors. In gain-of- function experiments leveraging a panel of transcriptional reporters, CSNK1{gamma}3 but not CSNK1{gamma}1 or CSNK1{gamma}2 activated {beta}-catenin-dependent WNT signaling and the Notch pathway. Within the family, CSNK1{gamma}3 expression uniquely induced LRP6 phosphorylation. Conversely, siRNA- mediated silencing of CSNK1{gamma}3 alone had no impact on WNT signaling, though co-silencing of all three family members decreased WNT pathway activity. We characterized two moderately selective and potent small molecule inhibitors of the CSNK1{gamma} family. These inhibitors and a CSNK1{gamma}3 kinase dead mutant suppressed but did not eliminate WNT-driven LRP6 phosphorylation and {beta}-catenin stabilization. Our data suggest that while CSNK1{gamma}3 expression uniquely drives pathway activity, potential functional redundancy within the family necessitates loss of all three family members to suppress the WNT signaling pathway.",

In this study, we combined several culture-independent approaches, including 16S/ITS metagenetics, assembly- and deep profiling-metagenomics to characterize the originality of the microbiota of five varieties of Brazilian artisanal cheeses from the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. Their core microbiota contained mainly lactic acid bacteria (LAB), of which Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the most frequent, followed by Streptococcus thermophilus in the South region. Moreover, several samples from the Southeast region contained, as dominant LAB, two other food Streptococci belonging to a new species of the salivarius group and S. infantarius. Rinds of samples from the Southeast region were dominated by the halotolerant bacterium Corynebacterium variabile and the yeasts Diutina catenulata and, to a lesser extent, by Debaryomyces hansenii and Kodamaea ohmeri. Rinds from the South region contained mainly LAB due to their short ripening time, and the predominant yeast was D. hansenii. Phylogenomic analysis based on L. lactis metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) showed that most Brazilian strains are closely related and form a different clade from those whose genomes are available at this time, indicating that they belong to a specific group. Lastly, functional analysis showed that S. infantarius acquired a [~]26 kb DNA fragment from S. thermophilus starter strains that carry the LacSZ system, allowing fast lactose assimilation, an adaptation advantage for growth in milk. Finally, our study identified several areas of concern, such as the presence of somatic cell DNA and high levels of antibiotic resistance genes in several cheese microbiota, implying that the milk used was from diseased herds. Overall, the data from this study highlight the potential value of the traditional and artisanal cheese production network in Brazil, and provide a metagenomic-based scheme to help manage this resource safely.",

The NOX2 protein complex is composed of six subunits: two membrane proteins (gp91phox and p22phox) forming the catalytic core, three cytosolic proteins (p67phox, p47phox and p40phox) and a small GTPase Rac. The sophisticated activation mechanism of the NADPH oxidase relies on the assembly of cytosolic subunits with the membrane-bound components. A chimeric protein, called  Trimera, composed of the essential domains of the cytosolic proteins p47phox (aa 1-286), p67phox (aa 1-212) and full-length Rac1Q61L, enables a constitutive and robust NOX2 activity in cells without the need of any stimulus. We employed Trimera as a single activating protein of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in living cells and examined the consequences on the cell physiology of this continuous and long-term NOX activity. We showed that the sustained high level of NOX activity causes acidification of the intracellular pH, triggers apoptosis and leads to local peroxidation of lipids in the membrane. These local damages to the membrane correlate with the strong tendency of the Trimera to clusterize in the plasma membrane observed by FRET-FLIM microscopy.\n\nHighlightsO_LITrimera is a tool to trigger a continuous ROS production in living cells\nC_LIO_LIContinuous NOX2 activity causes cytosol acidification and apoptosis\nC_LIO_LIROS overproduction leads to localized oxidation of the membrane lipids\nC_LIO_LITrimera tends to clusterize in the plasma membrane of COSNOX and COS-7 cells\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Paraquat is one of the most widely used nonselective herbicides in agriculture. Due to its wide use, paraquat resistant weeds have emerged and is becoming a potential threat to agriculture. The molecular mechanisms of paraquat resistance in weeds remain largely unknown. Physiological studies indicated that the impaired translocation of paraquat and enhanced antioxidation could improve paraquat resistance in plants. However, the detoxification of paraquat via active metabolism by plants has not been reported to date. Here we report that an activated expression of At1g01600 encoding the P450 protein CYP86A4 confers paraquat resistance as revealed by the gain-of-function mutant paraquat tolerance 11D (pqt11D), in which a T-DNA with four 35S enhancers was inserted at 1646 bp upstream the ATG of At1g01600. The paraquat resistance can be recapitulated in Arabidopsis wild type by overexpressing AtPQT11 (At1g01600), while its knockout mutant is hypersensitive to paraquat. Moreover, AtPQT11 also confers paraquat resistance in E. coli when overexpressed. We further demonstrate that AtPQT11 has P450 enzyme activity that converts paraquat to N-demethyl paraquat nontoxic to Arabidopsis, therefore detoxifying paraquat in plants. Taken together, our results unequivocally demonstrate that AtPQT11/ CYP86A4 detoxifies paraquat via active metabolism, thus revealing a novel molecular mechanism of paraquat resistance in plants and providing a means potentially enabling crops to resist paraquat.",

Woo et al. argue that the CN profiles of PDXs are highly conserved, and that the main conclusions of our paper are invalid due to our use of expression-based CN profiles2. Here, we reassess genomic evolution of PDXs using the DNA-based CN profiles reported by Woo et al. We find that the degree of genomic evolution in the DNA-based dataset of Woo et al. is similar to that which we had previously reported. While the overall Pearsons correlation of CN profiles between primary tumors (PTs) and their derived PDXs is high (as reported in our original paper as well), a median of ~10% of the genome is differentially altered between PTs and PDXs across cohorts (range, 0% to 73% across all models). In 24% of the matched PT-PDX samples, over a quarter of the genome is differentially affected by CN alterations. Moreover, in matched analyses of PTs and their derived PDXs at multiple passages, later-passage PDXs are significantly less similar to their parental PTs than earlier-passage PDXs, indicative of genomic divergence. We conclude that genomic evolution of PDX models during model generation and propagation should not be dismissed, and that the phenotypic consequences of this evolution ought to be assessed in order to optimize the application of these valuable cancer models.",

However, identifying the evolutionary impacts of human activities, both direct and indirect, is challenging because of lack of temporal data and limited knowledge of the genetic basis of most traits1. Atlantic salmon is a species exposed to intense anthropogenic pressures during its anadromous life cycle2. Previous research has shown that salmon age at maturity has evolved towards earlier maturation over the last 40 years, with an 18% decrease3 in the allele associated with late maturation at the large-effect vgll3 locus4; but the drivers of this change remain unknown. Here, we link genetic and phenotypic changes in a large Atlantic salmon population with salmon prey species biomass in the Barents Sea, temperature, and fishing effort in order to identify drivers of age at maturity evolution. We show that age at maturity evolution is associated with two different types of fisheries induced evolution acting in opposing directions: an indirect effect linked with commercial harvest of a salmon prey species (capelin) at sea (selection against late maturation), and a direct effect due to temporal changes in net fishing pressure in the river (surprisingly, selection against early maturation). Although the potential for direct and indirect evolutionary effects of fishing have been acknowledged, empirical evidence for induced changes at the genetic level has been lacking5. As capelin are primarily harvested to produce fish meal and oil for aquaculture6, we hereby identify an indirect path by which Atlantic salmon aquaculture may negatively affect wild populations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).",

However, the discovery of novel non-apoptotic caspase functions has revealed unknown intricacies about the interplay between these enzymes and tumor progression. To investigate this biological problem, we capitalized on a Drosophila tumor model highly relevant for humans that relies on the concomitant upregulation of EGFR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Our results indicate that widespread non-apoptotic activation of initiator caspases limits JNK signaling and facilitates cell fate commitment in these tumors, thus preventing the overgrowth and exacerbation of malignant features. Intriguingly, these caspase functions are strongly linked to the ability of these enzymes to control the recruitment and subsequent proliferation in situ of macrophage-like cells on the tumor. These findings assign novel tumor-suppressor activities to caspases independent of apoptosis, while providing highly relevant molecular details to understanding their diverse contribution during tumor progression.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Several age predictors based on DNA methylation, dubbed epigenetic clocks, have been created in recent years, with the vast majority based on regularized linear regression. This study explores the improvement in the performance and interpretation of epigenetic clocks using deep learning. First, we gathered 143 publicly available data sets from several human tissues to develop AltumAge, a neural network framework that is a highly accurate and precise age predictor. Compared to ElasticNet, AltumAge performs better for within-data set and cross-data set age prediction, being particularly more generalizable in older ages and new tissue types. We then used deep learning interpretation methods to learn which methylation sites contributed to the final model predictions. We observe that while most important CpG sites are linearly related to age, some highly-interacting CpG sites can influence the relevance of such relationships. Using chromatin annotations, we show that the CpG sites with the highest contribution to the model predictions were related to gene regulatory regions in the genome, including proximity to CTCF binding sites. We also found age-related KEGG pathways for genes containing these CpG sites. Lastly, we perform downstream analyses of AltumAge to explore its applicability and compare its age acceleration with Horvaths model. We show that our neural network approach predicts higher age acceleration for tumors and for cells that exhibit age-related changes in vitro, such as replicative senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction. Altogether, our neural network approach provides significant improvement and flexibility to current epigenetic clocks for both performance and model interpretability.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling reliably classifies bladder cancers into luminal and basal molecular subtypes. Based on their prognostic and predictive associations, these subtypes may improve clinical management of bladder cancers. However, the complexity of published subtyping algorithms has limited their translation into practice. Here we optimize and validate compact subtyping algorithms based on the Lund taxonomy. We reanalyzed immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression data of muscle-invasive bladder cancer samples from Lund 2017 (n=193) and 2012 (n=76) cohorts. We characterized and quantified IHC expression patterns, and determined the simplest, most accurate decision tree models to identify subtypes. We tested the utility of a previously published algorithm using routine antibody assays commonly available in surgical pathology laboratories (GATA3, KRT5 and p16) to identify basal/luminal subtypes and to distinguish between luminal subtypes, Urothelial-Like (Uro) and Genomically Unstable (GU). We determined the dominant decision tree classifiers using four-fold cross-validation with separate uniformly distributed train (75%) and validation (25%) sets. Using the three-antibody algorithm resulted in 86-95% accuracy across training and validation sets for identifying basal/luminal subtypes, and 67-86% accuracy for basal/Uro/GU subtypes. Although antibody assays for KRT14 and RB1 are not routinely used in pathology practice, these features achieved the simplest and most accurate models to identify basal/luminal and Uro/GU/basal subtypes, achieving 93-96% and 85-86% accuracies, respectively. When translated to a more complex model using eight antibody assays, accuracy was comparable to simplified models, with 86% (train) and 82% (validation). We conclude that a simple immunohistochemical classifier can accurately identify luminal (Uro, GU) and basal subtypes and pave the way for clinical implementation.",

In contrast, highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 may evade or antagonize RNA-induced IFN I/III responses.\n\nMethodsIn airway epithelial cells (AECs) from children and older adults we compared IFN I/III responses to SARS-CoV-2 and HRV-16, and assessed whether pre-infection with HRV-16, or pretreatment with recombinant IFN-{beta} or IFN-{lambda}, modified SARS-CoV-2 replication. Bronchial AECs from children (ages 6-18 yrs.) and older adults (ages 60-75 yrs.) were differentiated ex vivo to generate organotypic cultures. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or HRV-16, and RNA and protein was harvested from cell lysates 96 hrs. following infection and supernatant was collected 48 and 96 hrs. following infection. In additional experiments cultures were pre-infected with HRV-16, or pre-treated with recombinant IFN-{beta}1 or IFN-{lambda}2 before SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nResultsDespite significant between-donor heterogeneity SARS-CoV-2 replicated 100 times more efficiently than HRV-16. IFNB1, INFL2, and CXCL10 gene expression and protein production following HRV-16 infection was significantly greater than following SARS-CoV-2. IFN gene expression and protein production were inversely correlated with SARS-CoV-2 replication. Treatment of cultures with recombinant IFN{beta}1 or IFN{lambda}2, or pre-infection of cultures with HRV-16, markedly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication.\n\nDiscussionIn addition to marked between-donor heterogeneity in IFN responses and viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a less robust IFN response in primary AEC cultures than does rhinovirus, and heterologous rhinovirus infection, or treatment with recombinant IFN-{beta}1 or IFN-{lambda}2, markedly reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

Nonetheless, optimum scan duration and time interval for image analysis are currently unknown. Further, it is unclear whether rest/stress PET-MPI with 18F-flurpiridaz is feasible in mice.\n\nMethodsRest/stress PET-MPI was performed with 18F-flurpiridaz (0.6-3.0 MBq) in 29 mice aged 7-8 months. Regadenoson (0.1 g/g) was used for induction of vasodilator stress. Kinetic modeling was performed using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Image-derived myocardial 18F-flurpiridaz uptake was assessed for different time intervals by placing a volume of interest in the left ventricular myocardium.\n\nResultsTracer kinetics were best described by a two-tissue compartment model. K1 ranged from 6.7-20.0 mL/cm3/min, while myocardial volumes of distribution (VT) were between 34.6 and 83.6 mL/cm3. Of note, myocardial 18F-flurpiridaz uptake (%ID/g) was significantly correlated with K1 at rest and following pharmacological stress testing for all time intervals assessed. However, while Spearmans coefficients (rs) ranged between 0.478 and 0.672, R2 values were generally low. In contrast, an excellent correlation of myocardial 18F-flurpiridaz uptake with VT was obtained, particularly when employing the averaged myocardial uptake from 20-40 min post tracer injection (R2 [&ge;]0.98). Notably, K1 and VT were similarly sensitive to pharmacological stress induction. Further, mean stress-to-rest ratios of K1, VT, and %ID/g 18F-flurpiridaz were virtually identical, suggesting that %ID/g 18F-flurpiridaz can be used to estimate CFR in mice.\n\nConclusionOur findings suggest that a simplified assessment of relative myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve (CFR), based on image-derived tracer uptake, is feasible with 18F-flurpiridaz in mice, enabling high-throughput mechanistic CFR studies in rodents.",

Protein functions in paralog families have been extensively studied, but little is known about the roles of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), even though more than half of eukaryotic proteins have them. Using the RNA-binding protein Musashi family as an example, we applied multiple structural techniques and phylogenetic analysis to show how members in a paralog family have evolved their IDRs to different physicochemical properties but converge to the same function. In this example, the lower prion-like tendency of Musashi-1s IDRs, rather than Musashi-2s, is compensated by its higher -helical propensity to assist their assembly. Without a folded structure to restraint, IDRs sequences mutate faster along with evolution. No matter how fast they change, our work suggests that IDRs evolve different traits to a converged function, such as liquid-liquid phase separation.",

Here, we present a non-invasive approach based on modified optical tweezers for quantifying sub-cellular material properties deep inside living zebrafish. Material properties of cells within the gut region of living zebrafish are quantified as deep as 150 m into the biological tissue. The measurements demonstrate differential mechanical properties of the developing foregut organs progenitors: Gut progenitors are more elastic than any of the neighboring cell populations at the time when the developing organs undergo substantial displacements during morphogenesis. The higher elasticity of gut progenitors correlates with an increased cellular concentration of microtubules. The results infer a role of material properties during morphogenesis and the approach paves the way for quantitative material investigations in vivo of embryos, explants, or organoids.",

Using simulated as well as real ST datasets from diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies comprising a variety of spatial resolutions such as Spatial Transcriptomics, 10X Visium, DBiT-seq, and Slide-seq, we show that STdeconvolve can effectively recover cell-type transcriptional profiles and their proportional representation within pixels without reliance on external single-cell transcriptomics references. STdeconvolve provides comparable performance to existing reference-based methods when suitable single-cell references are available, as well as potentially superior performance when suitable single-cell references are not available.

However, its intracellular function and signaling regulation remain unclear. Here, we show that intracellular MDK interacts with LKB1 and STRAD to disrupt the LKB1-STRAD-Mo25 complex. Consequently, MDK decreases the activity of LKB1 to dampen both the basal and stress-induced activation of AMPK by glucose starvation or treatment of 2-DG. We also found that MDK accelerates cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the activation of the LKB1-AMPK axis. In human cancers, compared to other well-known growth factors, MDK expression is most significantly upregulated in cancers, especially in liver, kidney and breast cancers, correlating with clinical outcomes and inversely correlating with PRKAA1 (encoding AMPK1) expression and phosphorylated AMPK levels.

CARD9 is a central mediator of inflammatory signaling mediated by C-type lectin receptors. CARD9 inhibitor BRD5529 has been shown to be an effective in vitro inhibitor of Pneumocystis {beta}-glucan-induced proinflammatory signaling and downstream TNF-alpha production, suggesting its viability as a candidate for preliminary drug testing as an anti- inflammatory agent in the rodent Pneumocystis pneumonia model (PCP).\n\nMethodsTo assess for potential toxicity, mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) daily either with vehicle or BRD5529 at 0.1 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg for two weeks. Mouse weights were taken daily. At day 14, mice were euthanized, weighed, and analyzed by flexiVent for lung stiffness. Lungs, liver, and kidney were then harvested for H&E staining and pathology scoring. Lung samples were further analyzed for proinflammatory cytokines via ELISA and extracellular matrix generation via quantitative PCR (q-PCR). Blood collection postmortem was performed for blood chemistry analysis.\n\nResultsBRD5529 at both doses of IP administration resulted in no significant changes in daily or final weight gain. Analysis of lung stiffness by flexiVent showed no significant differences between the control or treated groups. Furthermore, ELISA results for proinflammatory IL-1 Beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha showed no major differences in the respective groups. qPCR analysis of extracellular matrix transcripts collagen type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) and fibronectin (Fn) were statically similar as well in the treated and control groups. Examination and pathology scoring of H&E slides from lung, liver, and kidney from the each of the mice in all groups and subsequent pathology scoring showed no significant change. Blood chemistry analysis revealed similar, non-significant patterns.\n\nConclusionsBRD5529 in our initial general safety and toxicology assessments displayed no inherent safety concerns in the analyzed parameters. These data support broader in vivo testing of the inhibitor as a timed adjunct therapy to the deleterious proinflammatory host immune response often associated with anti-Pneumocystis therapy.",

Several studies have now demonstrated that increased neurogenesis can induce forgetting of memories acquired prior to the manipulation of neurogenesis and, as a result of this forgetting can also facilitate new learning. However, the mechanisms mediating neurogenesis-induced forgetting are not well understood. Here, we used a subregion-based analysis of the immediate early gene c-Fos as well as in vivo fiber photometry to determine changes in activity corresponding with neurogenesis induced forgetting. We found that increasing neurogenesis led to reduced CA1 activity during context memory retrieval. We also demonstrate here that perineuronal net expression in areas CA1 is bidirectionally altered by the levels or activity of adult generated neurons in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that neurogenesis may induce forgetting by disrupting perineuronal nets in CA1 which may otherwise protect memories from degradation.",

However, this scenario leaves out significant brain areas not directly involved with sensory input and behavioral control. Suggesting the relevance of cortical activity unrelated to sensory stimulation, such as sleep, we investigated adolescent transformations in the topography of sleep spindles. Sleep spindles are known to be involved in neural plasticity and in adults have a bimodal topography: slow spindles are frontally dominant, while fast spindles have a parietal/precuneal origin. The late functional segregation of the precuneus from the frontoparietal network during adolescence suggests that spindle topography might approach the adult state relatively late in development, and it may not be a result of the posterior-to-anterior maturational pattern. We analyzed the topographical distribution of spindle parameters in HD-EEG polysomnographic sleep recordings of adolescents and found that slow spindle duration maxima traveled from central to anterior brain regions, while fast spindle density, amplitude and frequency peaks traveled from central to more posterior brain regions. These results provide evidence for the gradual posteriorization of the anatomical localization of fast sleep spindles during adolescence and indicate the existence of an anterior-to posterior pattern of human brain maturation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The human SLC22A6/OAT1 plays an important role in the elimination of a broad range of endogenous substances and xenobiotics thus attracting attention from the pharmacological community. Furthermore, OAT1 is also involved in key physiological events such as the remote inter-organ communication. Despite its significance, the knowledge about hOAT1 structure and the transport mechanism at the atomic level remains fragmented owing to the lack of resolved structures. By means of protein-threading modeling refined by s-scaled Molecular Dynamics simulations, the present study provides the first robust model of hOAT1 in outward-facing conformation. Taking advantage of the AlphaFold 2 predicted structure of hOAT1 in inward-facing conformation, we here provide the essential structural and functional features comparing both states. The intracellular motifs conserved among Major Facilitator Superfamily members create a so-called \"charge-relay system\" that works as molecular switches modulating the conformation. The principal element of the event points at interactions of charged residues that appear crucial for the transporter dynamics and function. Moreover, hOAT1 model was embedded in different lipid bilayer membranes highlighting the crucial structural dependence on lipid-protein interactions. MD simulations supported the pivotal role of phosphatidylethanolamine components to the protein conformation stability. The present model is made available to decipher the impact of any observed polymorphism and mutation on drug transport as well as to understand substrate binding modes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is characterized by a failure of cells to complete skeletal muscle differentiation. Although ERMS cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress, the relevance of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis in oncogenesis is unclear. Here, we show that ERMS cell lines as well as primary tumours exhibit elevated expression of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU). MCU knockdown resulted in impaired mitochondrial calcium uptake and a reduction in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) levels. Phenotypically, MCU knockdown cells exhibited reduced cellular proliferation and motility, with an increased propensity to differentiate in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing of MCU knockdown cells revealed a significant reduction in genes involved in TGF{beta} signalling that play prominent roles in oncogenesis and inhibition of myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, modulation of mROS production impacted TGF{beta} signalling. Our study elucidates mechanisms by which mitochondrial calcium dysregulation promotes tumour progression and suggests that targeting the MCU complex to restore mitochondrial calcium homeostasis could be a therapeutic avenue in ERMS.",

We casted this problem within a system-theoretic framework, where we initially performed distributed EEG source space reconstruction and subsequently employed block-structured linear and non-linear models to predict the BOLD signal from the instantaneous power in narrow frequency bands of the source local field potential (LFP) spectrum (<100 Hz). Our results suggest that the dynamics of the BOLD signal can be sufficiently described as the convolution between a linear combination of the power profile within individual frequency bands with a hemodynamic response function (HRF). During the motor task, BOLD signal variance was mainly explained by the EEG oscillations in the beta band. On the other hand, during resting-state all frequency bands of EEG exhibited significant contributions to BOLD signal variance. Moreover, the contribution of each band was found to be region specific. Our results also revealed considerable variability of the HRF across different brain regions. Specifically, sensory-motor cortices exhibited positive HRF shapes, whereas parietal and occipital cortices exhibited negative HRF shapes under both experimental conditions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In this work, we use methods and concepts of applied algebraic topology to comprehensively explore the recent idea of topological phase transitions (TPT) in complex systems. TPTs are characterized by the emergence of nontrivial homology groups as a function of a threshold parameter. Under certain conditions, one can identify TPTs via the zeros of the Euler characteristic or by singularities of the Euler entropy. Recent works provide strong evidence that TPTs can be interpreted as a complex networks intrinsic fingerprint. This work illustrates this possibility by investigating some classic network and empirical protein interaction networks under a topological perspective. We first investigate TPT in protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) using methods of topological data analysis for two variants of the Duplication-Divergence model, namely, the totally asymmetric model and the heterodimerization model. We compare our theoretical and computational results to experimental data freely available for gene co-expression networks (GCN) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also known as bakers yeast, as well as of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Supporting our theoretical expectations, we can detect topological phase transitions in both networks obtained according to different similarity measures. Later, we perform numerical simulations of TPTs in four classical network models: the Erd[o]s-Renyi model, the Watts-Strogatz model, the Random Geometric model, and the Barabasi-Albert. Finally, we discuss some perspectives and insights on the topic. Given the universality and wide use of those models across disciplines, our work indicates that TPT permeates a wide range of theoretical and empirical networks.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Many naturally-occurring bacteria lead a lifestyle of metabolic dependency, i.e., they depend on others for crucial resources. We do not understand what factors drive bacteria towards this lifestyle, and how. Here, we systematically show that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a crucial role in the evolution of dependencies in bacteria. Across 835 bacterial species, we map gene gain-loss dynamics on a deep evolutionary tree, and assess the impact of HGT and gene loss on bacterial metabolic networks. Our analyses suggest that genes acquired by HGT can affect which genes are later lost. Dependency evolution is contingent on earlier HGT because of two reasons. First, we find that HGT typically adds new catabolic routes to bacterial metabolic networks. This increases the chance of new metabolic interactions between bacteria, which is a prerequisite for dependency evolution. Second, we show that gaining new routes can promote the loss of specific ancestral routes (a mechanism we call \"coupled gains and losses\", CGLs). Phylogenetic patterns indicate that both types of dependencies -- those mediated by CGLs and those purely by gene loss -- are equally likely. Our results highlight HGT as an important driver of metabolic dependency evolution in bacteria.",

Specific localization of lipids and proteins in these domains is often essential for membrane function and integrity. Due to the nanoscale size and dynamic nature of membrane domains, identification of molecules residing in domains either is not possible with modern imaging techniques or requires advanced methods with high spatiotemporal resolution. Such methods need expensive equipment making these approaches inaccessible and thus difficult to implement at large scale. Here, we present a novel membrane fluidizer-induced clustering (MFIC) approach to identify the phase-preference of molecules in intact cell membranes. Experiments in phase-separated bilayers and live cells on molecules with known phase preference demonstrate that heptanol hyperfluidizes the membrane and stabilizes phase separation in cell membranes. The domain stabilization results in a transition of nano-to micron-sized clusters of associated molecules and allows identification of molecules localized in domains using routine microscopy techniques. This assay can be carried out on both genetically and extrinsically labelled molecules in live cell membranes, does not require any invasive sample preparation and can be carried out in 10-15 minutes. This inexpensive and easy to implement assay can be conducted at large-scale and will allow easy identification of molecules partitioning into domains.",

NHEJ requires no or minimal end processing for ligation, whereas HR requires 5 end resection followed by a search for homology. The main event that determines the mode of repair is the initiation of 5 resection because if resection starts, then NHEJ cannot occur. Nej1 is a canonical NHEJ factor that functions at the cross-roads of repair pathway choice and prior to its function in stimulating Dnl4 ligase. Nej1 competes with Dna2, inhibiting its recruitment to DSBs and thereby inhibiting resection. The highly conserved C-terminal region (CTR) of Nej1 (330-338) is important for two events that drive NHEJ, stimulating ligation and inhibiting resection, but it is dispensable for end-bridging. By combining nej1 point mutants with nuclease-dead dna2-1, we find that Nej1-F335 is essential for end-joining whereas V338 promotes NHEJ indirectly through inhibiting Dna2-mediated resection.\n\nHighlightsO_LINej1 C-terminus is critical for repair pathway choice.\nC_LIO_LIThe KKRK region of Nej1 is important for interactions with ssDNA and dsDNA.\nC_LIO_LINej1-F335 and V338 are key residues for end-joining and inhibition of resection at DSB.\nC_LIO_LINej1-mediated end-bridging is not sufficient for end-joining repair.\nC_LI",

In males, the most common mechanism of drive involves the disruption of sperm bearing alternative alleles. While at least two loci are important for male drive-- the driver and the target-- linked modifiers can enhance drive, creating selection pressure to suppress recombination. In this work, we investigate the evolution and genomic consequences of an autosomal multilocus, male meiotic drive system, Segregation Distorter (SD) in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In African populations, the predominant SD chromosome variant, SD-Mal, is characterized by two overlapping, paracentric inversion on chromosome arm 2R and nearly perfect (~100%) transmission. We study the SD-Mal system in detail, exploring its components, chromosomal structure, and evolutionary history. Our findings reveal a recent chromosome-scale selective sweep mediated by strong epistatic selection for haplotypes carrying Sd, the main driving allele, and one or more factors within the double inversion. While most SD-Mal chromosomes are homozygous lethal, SD-Mal haplotypes can recombine with other, complementing haplotypes via crossing over and with wildtype chromosomes only via gene conversion. SD-Mal chromosomes have nevertheless accumulated lethal mutations, excess non-synonymous mutations, and excess transposable element insertions. Therefore, SD-Mal haplotypes evolve as a small, semi-isolated subpopulation with a history of strong selection. These results may explain the evolutionary turnover of SD haplotypes in different populations around the world and have implications for supergene evolution broadly.",

Fibrillin microfibrils are macromolecular ECM complexes serving structural and regulatory roles. In mice, Fbn1 and Fbn2, encoding major microfibrillar components, are strongly expressed during embryogenesis, but fibrillin-1 is the major component observed in adult tissue microfibrils. Here, analysis of mouse Adamts6 and Adamts10 mutant embryos, lacking these homologous secreted metalloproteases individually and in combination, along with in vitro analysis of microfibrils, measurement of ADAMTS6-fibrillin affinities and N-terminomics identification of ADAMTS6-cleaved sites, demonstrates a transcriptionally adapted system for fibrillin-2 proteolysis that contributes to postnatal fibrillin-1 dominance. The lack of ADAMTS6, alone and in combination with ADAMTS10 led to excess fibrillin-2 in perichondrium, with impaired skeletal development resulting from a drastic reduction of aggrecan, cartilage link protein and impaired BMP, but not TGF{beta} signaling in cartilage. Although ADAMTS6 cleaves fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 as well as fibronectin, which provides the initial scaffold for microfibril assembly, primacy of the protease-substrate relationship between ADAMTS6 and fibrillin-2 was unequivocally established by reversal of these defects in Adamts6-/- embryos by genetic reduction of Fbn2, but not Fbn1.",

A mix of underlying factors has been speculated to give rise to this differential infection outcome, including changes in lung physiology, weakened immunity, and severe immune response. Our study focuses on the impact of biomechanical changes in lungs that occur as individuals age, i.e., the stiffening of the lung parenchyma and increased matrix fiber density. We used hydrogels with an elastic modulus of 0.2 and 50 kPa and conventional tissue culture surfaces to investigate how infection rate changes with parenchymal tissue stiffness in lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein pseudotyped lentiviruses. Further, we employed electrospun fiber matrices to isolate the effect of matrix density. Given the recent data highlighting the importance of alternative virulent strains, we included both the native strain identified in early 2020 and an early S protein variant (D614G) that was shown to increase the viral infectivity markedly. Our results show that cells on softer and sparser scaffolds, closer resembling younger lungs, exhibit higher infection rates by the WT and D614G variant. This suggests that natural changes in lung biomechanics do not increase the propensity for SARS-CoV-2 infection and that other factors, such as a weaker immune system, may contribute to increased disease burden in the elderly.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated involving adipogenesis, and played a crucial role in the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) effect.

NASAs planned expedition to Mars will expose astronauts to space radiation (SR) that has the potential to impair performance in mission critical tasks. Impairments in task accuracy and movement kinematics have been previously reported during string-pulling behavior ~7 months after SR exposure. If similar SR-induced sensorimotor deficits emerge at earlier times, then astronauts may have compromised in-flight performance disruptions while performing skilled tasks in critical situations, such as when manipulating controls or performing seat egress. Due to the possibility that such performance losses may compromise mission success, it is critical to determine if sensorimotor, motivation, or attentional deficits occur acutely after SR exposure at a time point that corresponds to in-flight performance. Male Wistar rats were thus exposed to either 10 cGy simplified galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim), 10 cGy 4Helium (4He), or no radiation at all (Sham), and string-pulling behavior was assessed approximately 72 hours later. Following exposure to SR, rats (4He) took more time to approach the string to initiate string-pulling behavior and to pull in the string to reach the Cheerio (4He and GCRsim) relative to Sham rats. 4He-exposed rats also exhibited a greater number of misses and less contacts relative to both Sham and GCRsim-exposed rats. Further, rats exposed to 4He demonstrated less concentrated reach endpoints with both the left and right hands compared to GCR-exposed rats. This work suggests that sensorimotor function and motivation and/or attentional processes were impaired 72 hours after 4He-radiation exposure.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The brains functional connectome is dynamic, constantly reconfiguring in an individual-specific manner. However, which characteristics of such reconfigurations are subject to genetic effects, and to what extent, is largely unknown. Here, we identified heritable dynamic features, quantified their heritability, and determined their association with cognitive phenotypes. In resting-state fMRI, we obtained multivariate features, each describing a temporal or spatial characteristic of connectome dynamics jointly over a set of connectome states. We found strong evidence for heritability of temporal features, particularly fractional occupancy (FO) and transition probability (TP), describing the trajectory of state transitions. Genetic effects explained a substantial proportion of phenotypic variance of these features (h2=.39, 95% CI= [.24.54] for FO; h2=.43, 95% CI=[.29.57] for TP). Moreover, these temporal phenotypes were associated with cognitive performance. Contrarily, we found no robust evidence for heritability of spatial features of the dynamic states (i.e., states Modularity and connectivity pattern). Genetic effects may therefore primarily contribute to how the connectome transitions across states, rather than the precise spatial instantiation of the states in individuals. In sum, genetic effects impact the duration spent in each connectivity configuration and the frequency of shifting between configurations, and such temporal features may act as endophenotypes for cognitive abilities.",

The molecular mechanism involved in these dietary effects of neurogenesis are unknown. This study investigated the effects of oleic and palmitic acids, which are abundant in a high-fat diet, on the hypothalamic neuronal transcriptome and how these changes impact neurogenesis events. The results show differential effects of low and high concentrations of oleic or palmitic acid treatment on differential gene transcription. Gene ontology analysis uncovered significant gene enrichment in several cellular pathways involved in gene regulation and protein production, particularly with proliferation, migration, and cell survival. The enriched signaling pathways include Wnt, integrin, PDGF, and apoptosis, in addition endocrine function signaling pathways CCKR and GnRH. Further examination of proliferation and migration show low concentrations of oleic acid to stimulate proliferation and high concentrations of both oleic and palmitic acid to stimulate apoptosis. Oleic acid also reduced hypothalamic neuronal migration, with little effects by palmitic acid. The results show direct impact of the two most abundant fatty acids in a high fat diet to directly impact hypothalamic neuronal proliferation and migration. The results also uncovered signaling pathways affected by oleic and palmitic acid and suggest a mechanism of prenatal high-fat diet induced neurogenesis events is through these two abundant fatty acids.",

Although variation in the amount of browsed twigs is sometimes used to assess abundance of large herbivores, the potential confounding effect of resource availability on this relationship has not yet been investigated. To fill the gap, we measured how browsing intensity of the woody plants varied in response to changes in both roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) abundance and vegetation availability from an intensive long-term monitoring. We estimated plant availability and consumption by roe deer from a modified Aldous method throughout a 14 yearlong period during which we experimentally manipulated population density. The functional response was strongly non-linear and density-dependent. When plant availability was low (< 12.5%), browsing intensity strongly increased with plant availability with an increasing rate with roe deer density, whereas beyond this threshold, browsing intensity slightly increased with both plant availability and population density in an additive way. Thus, forest susceptibility to browsing increases with increasing competition for food, especially when plant availability is low. Moreover, the interplay between browsing intensity and population density at low plant availability prevents the use of browsing intensity to monitor roe deer abundance when plant availability is low. Our findings provide clear evidence that relying on key ecological concepts such as functional responses improves the accuracy of management tools when monitoring changes of the herbivore-plant system over time.",

This implies the existence of fundamental organizational principles that enable such efficiency. To elaborate on this, we performed intracranial recordings in 82 individuals while they performed tasks of varying visual and cognitive complexity. We discovered that visual inputs induce highly organized posterior-to-anterior propagating patterns of phase modulation across the ventral occipitotemporal cortex. At individual electrodes there was a stereotyped temporal pattern of phase progression following both stimulus onset and offset, consistent across trials and tasks. The phase of low frequency activity in anterior regions was predicted by the prior phase in posterior cortical regions. This spatiotemporal propagation of phase likely serves as a feed-forward organizational influence enabling the integration of information across the ventral visual stream. This phase modulation manifests as the early components of the event related potential; one of the most commonly used measures in human electrophysiology. These findings illuminate fundamental organizational principles of the higher order visual system that enable the rapid recognition and characterization of a variety of inputs.",

Here, using quantitative proteomics across three independent cohorts we systematically characterized the co-regulation patterns of mitochondrial RC proteins in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Whereas the abundance of RC protein subunits that physically assemble into stable complexes were correlated, indicating their co-regulation, RC assembly factors exhibited modest co-regulation. Within complex I, nuclear DNA-encoded subunits exhibited >2.5-times higher co-regulation than mitochondrial (mt)DNA-encoded subunits. Moreover, mtDNA copy number was unrelated to mtDNA-encoded subunits abundance, suggesting that mtDNA content is not limiting. Alzheimers disease (AD) brains exhibited reduced abundance of complex I RC subunits, an effect largely driven by a 2-4% overall lower mitochondrial protein content. These findings provide foundational knowledge to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to age- and disease-related erosion of mitochondrial function in the human brain.",

Their pleiotropic associations can be mechanistically informative: if many variants have similar patterns of association, they may act via similar pleiotropic mechanisms, forming a shared component of heritability. We developed Pleiotropic Decomposition Regression (PDR) to identify shared components and their underlying genetic variants. We validated PDR on simulated data and identified limitations of existing methods in recovering the true components. We applied PDR to three clusters of 5-6 traits genetically correlated with coronary disease, asthma, and type II diabetes respectively, producing biologically interpretable components. For CAD, PDR identified components related to BMI, hypertension and cholesterol, and it clarified the relationship among these highly correlated risk factors. We assigned variants to components, calculated their posterior-mean effect sizes, and performed out-of-sample validation. Our posterior-mean effect sizes pool statistical power across traits and substantially boost the correlation (r2) between true and estimated effect sizes compared with the original summary statistics: by 94% and 70% for asthma and T2D out of sample, and by a predicted 300% for CAD.",

Recent single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have revealed the context-dependent diversity in microglial properties and gene expression, but the cues promoting this diversity are not well defined. Here, we ask how interactions with apoptotic neurons shape microglial state, including lysosomal and lipid metabolism gene expression and independence from Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) for survival. Using early postnatal mouse retina, a CNS region undergoing significant developmental remodeling, we performed scRNAseq on microglia from mice that are wild-type, lack neuronal apoptosis (Bax KO), or are treated with CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397). We find that interactions with apoptotic neurons drives multiple microglial remodeling states, subsets of which are resistant to CSF1R inhibition. We find that TAM receptor Mer and complement receptor 3 are required for clearance of apoptotic neurons, but that Mer does not drive expression of remodeling genes. We show TAM receptor Axl is negligible for phagocytosis or remodeling gene expression but is consequential for microglial survival in the absence of CSF1R signaling. Thus, interactions with apoptotic neurons shift microglia towards distinct remodeling states and through Axl, alters microglial dependence on survival pathway, CSF1R.",

Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is capable of identifying unique patterns from functional connectivity (FC) between brain networks. To identify the relevant neural patterns and build an interpretable model to predict dishonesty, we scanned 8-min rsfMRI before an information-passing task. In the task, we employed monetary rewards to induce dishonesty. We applied both connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis to examine the association between FC and dishonesty. CPM indicated that the stronger FC between fronto-parietal and default mode networks can predict a higher dishonesty rate. The ROIs were set in the regions involving four cognitive processes (self-reference, cognitive control, reward valuation, and moral regulation). The ROI analyses showed that a stronger FC between these regions and the prefrontal cortex can predict a higher dishonesty rate. Our study offers an integrated model to predict dishonesty with rsfMRI, and the results suggest that the frequent motivated dishonest behavior may require a higher engagement of social brain regions.",

For commercially available printing materials, this includes challenges in producing prints with the print resolution and mechanical stability required for a particular design, along with cytotoxic components within many SL resins and low optical compatibility for imaging experiments. Potential solutions to these problems are scattered throughout the literature and rarely available in head-to-head comparisons. Therefore, we present here a concise guide to the principles of resin 3D printing most relevant for fabrication of bioanalytical microfluidic devices.

We identified a previously uncharacterized gene in the BREX operon that is dispensable for methylation but involved in restriction. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses of this factor, which we term BrxR ( BREX Regulator), demonstrate that it forms a homodimer and specifically binds a DNA target site upstream of its transcription start site. Deletion of the BrxR gene causes cell toxicity, reduces restriction, and significantly increases the expression of BrxC. In contrast, the introduction of a premature stop codon into the BrxR gene, or a point mutation blocking its DNA binding ability, has little effect on restriction, implying that the BrxR coding sequence and BrxR protein play independent functional roles. We speculate that the BrxR coding sequence is involved in cis regulation of anti-phage activity, while the BrxR protein plays an additional regulatory role, perhaps during horizontal transfer.",

First, we used tracing methods to establish the tubular striatum (TuS, also known as the olfactory tubercle) as the primary olfactory region to receive direct mPFC input in rats. Next, we recorded local field potentials from the olfactory bulb (OB), mPFC, and TuS while rats completed an olfactory selective attention task. Gamma power and coupling of gamma oscillations with theta phase were consistently high as rats flexibly switched their attention to odors. Beta and theta synchrony between mPFC and olfactory regions were elevated as rats switched their attention to odors. Finally, we found that sniffing was consistent despite shifting attentional demands, suggesting that the mPFC-OB theta coherence is independent of changes in active sampling. Together, these findings begin to define an olfactory attention network wherein mPFC activity, as well as that within olfactory regions, are coordinated in manners based upon attentional states.",

Results uncovered statistically significant SNP-analyte associations for five genetic variants after correction for multiple testing (for SNPs in or near NYAP1, ABCA7, INPP5D, and APOE). These effects were detectable from early adulthood. Sex modified the effects of four genetic variants, with multiple interrelated immune-modulating effects associated with the PICALM variant. Sex-stratified GWAS results from an independent AD case-control meta-analysis supported sexspecific disease effects of the PICALM variant, highlighting the importance of sex as a biological variable. These analyses support evidence from previous functional genomics studies in the identification of a causal variant within the PILRA gene.

Therefore, choosing which 16S rRNA hypervariable region to sequence is critical in microbiota profiling studies. All nine 16S rRNA hypervariable regions are taxonomically informative, but due to variability in profiling performance for specific clades, choosing the ideal 16S rRNA hypervariable region will depend on the bacterial composition of the habitat under study. Recently, NGS allowed the identification of microbes in the urinary tract, and urinary microbiota has become an active research area. However, there is no current study evaluating the performance of different 16S rRNA hypervariable regions for urinary microbiota profiling. We collected urine samples from male volunteers and profiled their urinary microbiota by sequencing a panel of six amplicons encompassing all nine 16S rRNA hypervariable regions. After systematically comparing their performance, we show that V1V2 hypervariable regions better assess the taxa commonly present in urine samples and V1V2 amplicon sequencing is more suitable for urinary microbiota profiling. We believe our results will be helpful to guide this crucial methodological choice in future urinary microbiota studies.",

Sociological experiments studying animal charisma have relied on stated preferences to find correlations between hypothetical \"willingness to pay\" or \"empathy\" for a species conservation and species size, color, and aesthetic appeal (51; 13; 16). Recognizing the increasing availability of digital records of public engagement with animals that reveal preferences, an emerging field of \"culturomics\" uses Google search results, Wikipedia article activities, and other digital modes of engagement to identify charismatic species and traits (46; 31; 10; 41). In this study, we take advantage of community science efforts as another form of digital data that can reveal observer preferences. We apply a multi-stage analysis to ask whether opportunistic birders contributing to iNaturalist engage more with larger, more colorful, and rarer birds relative to a baseline, from eBird contributors, approximating unbiased detection. We find that body mass, color contrast, and range size all predict over-representation in the opportunistic dataset. We also find evidence that, across 473 modeled species, 52 species are significantly overreported and 158 are significantly underreported, indicating a wide variety of species-specific effects. Understanding which birds are charismatic can aid conservationists in creating impactful outreach materials and engaging new naturalists. The quantified differences between two prominent community science efforts may also be of use for researchers leveraging the data from one or both of them to answer scientific questions of interest.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Ever since the first characterization of peroxisomes, a central theme has been their involvement in cellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) metabolism. While the reputation of H2O2 drastically changed from an exclusively toxic molecule to a signaling messenger, the regulatory role of peroxisomes in these signaling events is still largely underappreciated. This is mainly because the number of known protein targets of peroxisome-derived H2O2 is rather limited and testing of specific targets is predominantly based on knowledge previously gathered in related fields of research. To gain a broader and more systematic insight into the role of peroxisomes in redox signaling, an unbiased approach is urgently needed. To accomplish this goal, we have combined a previously developed cell system in which peroxisomal H2O2 production can be modulated with a yeast AP-1-like-based sulfenome mining strategy to inventory protein thiol targets of peroxisome-derived H2O2 in different subcellular compartments. Using this unbiased approach, we were able to identify specific and common targets of peroxisome-derived and exogenous H2O2 in peroxisomes, the cytosol, and mitochondria. We also observed that the sulfenylation kinetics profiles of key targets belonging to different protein families can vary considerably. In addition, we obtained compelling but indirect evidence that peroxisome-derived H2O2 may oxidize at least some of its targets through a redox relay mechanism. In conclusion, given that sulfenic acids function as key intermediates in H2O2 signaling, the findings presented in this study provide initial but critical insight into how peroxisomes may be integrated in the cellular H2O2 signaling network.\n\nHighlightsO_LIYAP1C-trapping is a robust tool to assess the peroxisomal H2O2-dependent sulfenome\nC_LIO_LIExogenous and peroxisome-derived H2O2 have both common and distinct targets\nC_LIO_LIANXA2, PRDX1, and SKP1 are major targets of peroxisome-derived H2O2\nC_LIO_LIThe sulfenylation kinetics profiles of key redox-active proteins vary considerably\nC_LIO_LIProduction of H2O2 inside peroxisomes directly impacts the mitochondrial sulfenome\nC_LI",

The assembly of the endocytic coat is initiated by a dynamic network of weakly interacting proteins, but the exact mechanism of initiation is unknown. Ede1, the yeast homologue of mammalian Eps15, is one of the early-arriving endocytic proteins and a key initiation factor. In the absence of Ede1, most other early endocytic proteins lose their punctate localization and the frequency of endocytic initiation is decreased. We show here that in mutants with increased amounts of cytoplasmic Ede1, the excess protein forms large condensates which exhibit properties of phase separated liquid protein droplets. These Ede1 condensates recruit many other early-arriving endocytic proteins. Their formation depends on the core region of Ede1 that contains a coiled coil and a low-complexity domain. We demonstrate that Ede1 core region is essential for the endocytic function of Ede1. The core region can also promote clustering of a heterologous lipid-binding domain into discrete sites on the plasma membrane that initiate endocytic events. We propose that the clustering of the early endocytic proteins and cargo depend on phase separation mediated by Ede1.",

Interfaces, particularly those with large nanostructured surface areas, can affect the kinetics of peptide aggregation, ranging from a complete inhibition to strong acceleration. While a number of physiochemical parameters determine interface effects, we here focus on the role of nanoparticle curvature for the aggregation of the amyloidogenic peptides A{beta}40, NNFGAIL, GNNQQNY and VQIYVK. Nanoparticles (NPs) provided a surface for peptide monomers to adsorb, enabling the nucleation into oligomers and fibril formation. High surface curvature, however, destabilized prefibrillar structures, providing an explanation for inhibitory effects on fibril growth. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy experiments revealed NP size-dependent effects on amyloid fibril formation, with differences between the peptides. While 5 nm gold NPs (AuNP-5) retarded or inhibited the aggregation of most peptides, larger 20 nm gold NPs (AuNP-20) tended to accelerate peptide aggregation. Molecular dynamics (MD) studies demonstrated that NPs ability to catalyze or inhibit oligomer formation was influenced by the oligomer stability at curved interfaces which was lower at more highly curved surfaces. Differences in the NP effects for the peptides resulted from the peptide properties (size, aggregation propensity) and concomitant surface binding affinities. The results can be applied to the design of future nanostructured materials for defined applications.",

However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying MT dynamics remain unclear. We show that the MAP7 family protein Map7D2 stabilizes MTs to control cell motility and neurite outgrowth. Map7D2 directly bound to MTs through its N-terminal half and stabilized MTs in vitro. Map7D2 localized prominently to the centrosome and partially on MTs in mouse N1-E115 neuronal cells, which expresses two of the four MAP7 family members, Map7D2 and Map7D1. Map7D2 loss decreased the resistance to the MT-destabilizing agent, nocodazole without affecting acetylated/detyrosinated stable MTs, suggesting that Map7D2 stabilizes MTs via direct binding. In addition, Map7D2 loss increased the rate of random cell migration and neurite outgrowth, presumably by disturbing the balance between MT stabilization and destabilization. Map7D1 exhibited similar subcellular localization and gene knock-down phenotypes to Map7D2. However, in contrast to Map7D2, Map7D1 was required for the maintenance of acetylated stable MTs. Taken together, our data suggest that Map7D2 and Map7D1 facilitate MT stabilization through distinct mechanisms in cell motility and neurite outgrowth.",

The fluidic flux declines with increasing hydraulic pressure until a stall pressure, at which the fluidic flux vanishes--in a manner similar to mechanical fluidic pumps. The developed pressure gradient translates to a force of 50-100 nanoNewtons per cell. For normal human kidney cells, the fluidic flux is from apical to basal, and the pressure is higher on the basal side. For human polycystic kidney disease (PKD) cells, the fluidic flux is reversed from basal to apical with a significantly higher stall pressure. Molecular studies and proteomic analysis reveal that renal epithelial cells are highly sensitive to hydraulic pressure gradients, developing different expression profiles and spatial arrangements of ion exchangers and the cytoskeleton in different pressure conditions. These results, together with data from osmotic and pharmacological perturbations of fluidic pumping, implicate mechanical force and hydraulic pressure as important variables during morphological changes in epithelial tubules, and provide further insights into pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of high luminal pressure within renal cysts.",

They stabilize the hydrophobic core of globular proteins and are typically absent from intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). However, recent advances in protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) studies have shown that aromatic residues in IDRs often act as important \"stickers\", promoting multivalent interactions and the formation of higher-order oligomers. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we compared levels of sequence disorder in RNA binding proteins and the human proteome and found that aromatic residues appear more frequently than expected in the IDRs of RNA binding proteins, which are often found to undergo LLPS. Phylogenetic analysis shows that aromatic residues are highly conserved among chordates, highlighting their importance in LLPS-driven functional assembly. These results suggest therefore that aromatic residues have contributed twice to evolution: in stabilizing structured proteins and in the assembly of biomolecular condensates.",

Previous work has shown that ICL- inducing agents cause damage to Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and its pso2/snm1 mutants exhibit a petite phenotype followed by loss of mtDNA integrity and copy number. Complex as it is, the cause and underlying molecular mechanisms remains elusive. Here, by combining a wide range of approaches with in vitro and in vivo analyses, we assessed the subcellular localization and function of Pso2. We found evidence that the nuclear-encoded Pso2 contains one mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and two nuclear localization signals (NLS1 and NLS2), although NLS1 resides within the MTS. Further analysis revealed that Pso2 is a dual-localized ICL repair protein; it can be imported into both nucleus and mitochondria, and that genotoxic agents enhance its abundance in the latter. While MTS is essential for mitochondrial Pso2 import, either NLS1 or NLS2 is sufficient for its nuclear import; this implies that the two NLS motifs are functionally redundant. Ablation of MTS abrogated mitochondrial Pso2 import, and concomitantly, raised its levels in the nucleus. Strikingly, mutational disruption of both NLS motifs blocked the nuclear Pso2 import; at the same time, they enhanced its translocation into the mitochondria, consistent with the notion that the relationship between MTS and NLS motifs is competitive. However, the nuclease activity of import-deficient species of Pso2 was not impaired. The potential relevance of dual-targeting of Pso2 into two DNA-bearing organelles is discussed.",

However, the high degree of uncertainty often associated with ancient DNA poses several methodological challenges, and performance of imputation methods in this context has not been fully explored. To gain further insights, we performed a systematic evaluation of imputation of ancient data using Beagle 4.0 and reference data from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes project, investigating the effects of coverage, phased reference and study sample size. Making use of five ancient samples with high-coverage data available, we evaluated imputed data with respect to accuracy, reference bias and genetic affinities as captured by PCA. We obtained genotype concordance levels of over 99% for data with 1x coverage, and similar levels of accuracy and reference bias at levels as low as 0.75x. Our findings suggest that using imputed data can be a realistic option for various population genetic analyses even for data in coverage ranges below 1x. We also show that a large and varied phased reference set as well as the inclusion of low- to moderate-coverage ancient samples can increase imputation performance, particularly for rare alleles. In-depth analysis of imputed data with respect to genetic variants and allele frequencies gave further insight into the nature of errors arising during imputation, and can provide practical guidelines for post-processing and validation prior to downstream analysis.",

Here, we show that dynamic binding of TopoII speeds up the topological relaxation of knotted substrates by enhancing the search of the knotted arc. Intriguingly, this in turn implies that the timescale of topological relaxation is virtually independent of the substrate length. We then discover that considering binding biases due to facilitated diffusion on looped substrates steers the sampling of the topological space closer to the boundaries between different topoisomers yielding an optimally fast topological relaxation.

This might lead to coding gene repression in a process named Transcription Interference (TI). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), TI is mainly driven by antisense non-coding transcription and occurs through re-shaping of promoter Nucleosome-Depleted Regions (NDRs). In this study, we developed a genetic screen to identify new players involved in Antisense-Mediated Transcription Interference (AMTI). Among the candidates, we found the HIR histone chaperone complex known to be involved in de novo histone deposition. Using genome-wide approaches, we reveal that HIR-dependent histone deposition represses the promoters of SAGA-dependent genes via antisense non-coding transcription. However, while antisense transcription is enriched at promoters of SAGA-dependent genes, this feature is not sufficient to define the mode of gene regulation. We further show that the balance between HIR-dependent nucleosome incorporation and transcription factor binding at promoters directs transcription into a SAGA- or TFIID-dependent regulation. This study sheds light on a new connection between antisense non-coding transcription and the nature of coding transcription initiation.",

Similarly to coding genes, we propose that tumor suppressor miRNAs must show evidence of genetic or epigenetic inactivation in cancers, and exhibit an anti-tumorigenic (e.g., anti-proliferative) activity under endogenous expression levels. Here we observe that this definition excludes the most extensively studied tumor suppressor candidate miRNA, miR-34a. In analyzable cancer types, miR-34a does not appear to be down-regulated in primary tumors relatively to normal adjacent tissues. Deletion of miR-34a is occasionally found in human cancers, but it does not seem to be driven by an anti-tumorigenic activity of the miRNA, since it is not observed upon smaller, miR-34a-specific alterations. Its anti-proliferative action was observed upon large, supra-physiological transfection of synthetic miR-34a in cultured cells, and our data indicates that endogenous miR-34a levels do not have such an effect. Our results therefore argue against a general tumor suppressive function for miR-34a, providing an explanation to the lack of efficiency of synthetic miR-34a administration against solid tumors.",

However, kinship estimators are usually designed for diploid systems and cannot be used in populations with mixed haploid diploid genetic systems. The only estimators for different ploidies require datasets free of population structure, limiting their usage.\n\nResultsWe present KIMGENS, an estimator for kinship estimation among individuals of various ploidies, that is robust to population structure. This estimator is based on the popular KING-robust estimator but uses diploid relatives of the individuals of interest as references of heterozygosity and extends its use to haploid-diploid and haploid pairs of individuals. We demonstrate that KIMGENS estimates kinship more accurately than previously developed estimators in simulated panmictic, structured and admixed populations, but has lower accuracy when the individual of interest is inbred. KIMGENS also outperforms other estimators in a honeybee dataset. Therefore, KIMGENS is a valuable addition to a population geneticists toolbox.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationKIMGENS and its association simulation tool are implemented and available open-source at https://github.com/YenWenWang/HapDipKinship.\n\nContactYen-Wen Wang Email: ywang883@wisc.edu",

    "preprint_abstract": "Clustering analysis is widely utilized in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discover cell heterogeneity and cell states. While many clustering methods have been developed for scRNA-seq analysis, most of these methods require to provide the number of clusters. However, it is not easy to know the exact number of cell types in advance, and experienced determination is not always reliable. Here, we have developed ADClust, an automatic deep embedding clustering method for scRNA-seq data, which can accurately cluster cells without requiring a predefined number of clusters. Specifically, ADClust first obtains low-dimensional representation through pre-trained autoencoder, and uses the representations to cluster cells into initial micro-clusters. The clusters are then compared in between by a statistical test, and similar micro-clusters are merged into larger clusters. According to the clustering, cell representations are updated so that each cell will be pulled toward centres of its assigned cluster and similar clusters, while cells are separated to keep distances between clusters. This is accomplished through jointly optimizing the carefully designed clustering and autoencoder loss functions. This merging process continues until convergence. ADClust was tested on eleven real scRNA-seq datasets, and shown to outperform existing methods in terms of both clustering performance and the accuracy on the number of the determined clusters. More importantly, our model provides high speed and scalability for large datasets.",

The resulting diversity of mRNA molecules across different life-cycle stages impacts their functionality but has remained unresolved. Here we quantitatively map the 3' status of cellular RNAs in Escherichia coli during steady-state growth and report a large fraction of molecules (median>60%) that are fragments of canonical full-length mRNAs. The majority of RNA fragments are decay intermediates, whereas nascent RNAs contribute to a smaller fraction. Despite the prevalence of decay intermediates in total cellular RNA, these intermediates are underrepresented in the pool of ribosome-associated transcripts and can thus distort quantifications for the abundance of full-length, functional mRNAs. The large heterogeneity within mRNA molecules in vivo highlights the importance in discerning functional transcripts and provides a lens for studying the dynamic life cycle of mRNAs.",

Previous studies have shown that the U2AF2 RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) preferentially bind uridine-rich RNAs. Nonetheless, the specificity of the RRM1/RRM2 interface for the central Py tract nucleotide has yet to be investigated. We addressed this question by determining crystal structures of U2AF2 bound to a cytidine, guanosine, or adenosine at the central position of the Py tract, and compared U2AF2-bound uridine structures. Local movements of the RNA site accommodated the different nucleotides, whereas the polypeptide backbone remained similar among the structures. Accordingly, molecular dynamics simulations revealed flexible conformations of the central, U2AF2-bound nucleotide. The RNA binding affinities and splicing efficiencies of structure-guided mutants demonstrated that U2AF2 tolerates nucleotide substitutions at the central position of the Py tract. Moreover, enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of endogenous U2AF2 in human erythroleukemia cells showed uridine-sensitive binding sites with lower sequence conservation at the central nucleotide positions of otherwise uridine-rich, U2AF2-bound splice sites. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of RNA flexibility for protein recognition and take a step towards relating splice site motifs to pre-mRNA splicing efficiencies.",

In proliferating cells, it is regulated by 7SK snRNA in the 7SK snRNP complex. In resting cells, P-TEFb is absent, because CycT1 is dephosphorylated, released from CDK9 and rapidly degraded. In this study, we identified the mechanism of this degradation. We mapped the ubiquitination and degradation of free CycT1 to its N-terminal region from positions 1 to 280. This region is ubiquitinated at six lysines, where E3 ligases Siah1 and Siah2 bind and degrade these sequences. Importantly, the inhibition of Siah1/2 rescued the expression of free CycT1 in proliferating as well as resting primary cells. We conclude that Siah1/2 are the E3 ligases that bind and degrade the dissociated CycT1 in resting, terminally differentiated, anergic and/or exhausted cells.",

Different tissues, health and age conditions are characterised by a difference in mitochondrial structure and composition. The visual data mining platform mitoXplorer 1.0 was developed to explore the expression dynamics of genes associated with mitochondrial functions that could help explain these differences. It however lacked functions aimed at integrating mitochondria in the cellular context and thus, identifying regulators that help mitochondria adapt to cellular needs. To fill this gap, we upgraded the mitoXplorer platform to version 2.0 (mitoXplorer 2.0). In this upgrade we implemented two novel integrative functions, Network Analysis and the transcription factor- (TF-) Enrichment, to specifically help identify signalling or transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial processes. In addition, we implemented several other novel functions to allow the platform to go beyond simple data visualisation, such as an enrichment function for mitochondrial processes, a function to explore time-series data, the possibility to compare datasets across species as well as an IDconverter to help facilitate data upload. We demonstrate the usefulness of these functions in 3 specific use cases. mitoXplorer 2.0 is freely available without login at http://mitoxplorer2.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr.",

Decades of study have revealed two distinct mechanisms of cell movement during CE, one based on cell crawling and the other on junction contraction. How these two behaviors collaborate during CE is not understood. Here, using quantitative live cell imaging we show that these two modes act both independently and in concert during CE, but that cell movement is more effective when the two modes are integrated via mechano-reciprocity. Based on these findings, we developed a novel computational model that for the first time treats crawling and contraction independently. This model not only confirmed the biomechanical efficacy of integrating the two modes, but also revealed for the first time how the two modes -and their integration- are influenced by cell adhesion. Finally, we use these new insights to further understand the complex CE phenotype resulting from loss of the C-cadherin interacting catenin Arvcf. These data are significant for providing new biomechanical and cell biological insights into a fundamental morphogenetic process that is implicated in human neural tube defects and skeletal dysplasias.",

Paleobiologists often attempt to understand these indicators by assuming that the behaviors of modern microbes and enzymes are consistent (uniform) with those of their predecessors. A uniformitarian assumption (i.e., the idea that fundamental geobiological processes have occurred in much the same manner over Earth history) seems at odds with our understanding of the inherent variability of living systems. Here, we examine whether a uniformitarian assumption for an enzyme thought to generate carbon isotope indicators of biological activity, RuBisCO, can be corroborated by independently studying the history of changes recorded within RuBisCOs genetic sequences. Specifically, we resurrected a Precambrian-age, ancient RuBisCO by engineering its ancient DNA inside a modern cyanobacterium genome and measured the engineered organisms fitness and carbon-isotope-discrimination profile. The envelope of ancestral RuBisCO isotopic fractionation observed here indicates that uniformitarian assumptions may be warranted, but with important caveats. Our results suggest that further inquiries that link molecule-level evolutionary changes with planet-level geochemical conditions are needed to discern whether enzyme-affected isotope fractionation trends extend deeper into the early Precambrian. Experimental studies illuminating lifes early molecular innovations are crucial to explore the foundations of Precambrian uniformitarian assumptions.",

We found that ALT2 was overexpressed in liver of diet-induced obese and db/db mice and that the expression of the gene encoding ALT2 (GPT2) was downregulated following bariatric surgery in people with obesity. The increased hepatic expression of Gpt2 in db/db liver was mediated by activating transcription factor 4; an endoplasmic reticulum stress-activated transcription factor. Hepatocyte-specific knockout of Gpt2 attenuated incorporation of 13C-alanine into newly synthesized glucose by hepatocytes. In vivo Gpt2 knockdown or knockout in liver had no effect on glucose concentrations in lean mice, but Gpt2 suppression alleviated hyperglycemia in db/db mice.

Here, we conducted an extensive analysis on four ART-treated individuals who underwent an analytical treatment interruption (ATI). We performed subgenomic (V1-V3 env), near full-length proviral and integration site sequencing, and used multiple displacement amplification to sequence both the integration site and provirus from single HIV-infected cells. We found eight proviruses that could phylogenetically be linked to plasma virus obtained before or during the ATI.

We found that the 3 non-seed sequence functionally distinguishes let-7a from its family paralogs.

Nucleotides at g17-g22 are less critical but may compensate for mismatches in the g11-g16 region.

One possibility is that spontaneous activity provides contextual information in cortical computations, replaying previously learned patterns of activity5-8 that conditions the cortex to respond more efficiently, based on past experience. To test this, we measured the response of neuronal populations in mouse primary visual cortex with chronic two-photon calcium imaging during a visual habituation to a specific oriented stimulus. We unexpectedly found that, during habituation, spontaneous activity increased in neurons across the full range of orientation selectivity, eventually matching that of evoked levels. The increase in spontaneous activity strongly correlated with the degree of habituation. In fact, boosting spontaneous activity with two-photon optogenetic stimulation to the levels of stimulus-evoked activity induced habituation in naive animals. Our study shows that cortical spontaneous activity is causally linked to habituation, which unfolds by minimizing the difference between spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity levels, rendering the cortex less responsive. We also show how manipulating spontaneous activity can accelerate this type of learning. We hypothesize that spontaneous activity in visual cortex gates incoming sensory information.",

It has also been shown that predictive mechanisms in the auditory system demonstrate similar tonotopic organization of neural activity as that elicited by the perceived stimuli. However, it remains unclear if the mnemonic and predictive information can be decoded from cortical activity simultaneously and from overlapping neural populations. Here, we recorded neural activity using electrocorticography (ECoG) in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while exposed to repeated stimulus sequences, where events within the sequence were occasionally replaced with a broadband noise burst or omitted entirely. We show that both stimulus history and predicted stimuli can be decoded from neural responses to broadband impulse at overlapping latencies but linked to largely independent neural populations. We also demonstrate that predictive representations are learned over the course of stimulation at two distinct time scales, reflected in two dissociable time windows of neural activity. These results establish a valuable tool for investigating the neural mechanisms of passive sequence learning, memory encoding, and prediction mechanisms within a single paradigm, and provide novel evidence for learning predictive representations even under anaesthesia.",

While most attention has focused on the role of innate immune anti-bacterial responses, less is known about how changes in host metabolism contribute to host defence. Using Drosophila as a model system, we identify induction of intestinal target-of-rapamycin (TOR) kinase signalling as a key adaptive metabolic response to enteric infection. We find TOR is induced independently of the IMD innate immune pathway, and functions together with IMD signalling to promote infection survival. These protective effects of TOR signalling are associated with re-modelling of host lipid metabolism. Thus, we see that TOR switches intestinal metabolism to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, TOR is required to limit excessive infection mediated wasting of adipose lipid stores by promoting an increase in the levels of fat body-expressed de novo lipid synthesis genes. Our data support a model in which induction of TOR represents a host tolerance response to counteract infection-mediated lipid wasting in order to promote survival.",

Mbnl3 belongs to an RNA binding protein family whose members regulate alternative splicing and other aspects of RNA metabolism in association with cellular differentiation. We find that, in eutherians, Mbnl3 has become specifically expressed in placenta and has undergone accelerated sequence evolution leading to changes in its RNA binding specificities. Although its molecular roles are partly redundant with those of Mbnl2, Mbnl3 has also acquired novel biological functions. In particular, whereas Mbnl2;Mbnl3 double knockout mice display severe placental maturation defects leading to strong histological and functional abnormalities, Mbnl3 knockout alone results in increased placental growth and favors placental and fetal resource allocation during limiting conditions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Two-photon microscopy has been widely used to record the activity of populations of individual neurons at high spatial resolution in behaving animals. The ability to perform imaging for an extended period of time allows the investigation of activity changes associated with behavioral states and learning. However, imaging often accompanies shifts of the imaging field, including rapid ([~]100ms) translation and slow, spatially non-uniform distortion. To combat this issue and obtain a stable time series of the target structures, motion correction algorithms are commonly applied. However, typical motion correction algorithms are limited to full field translation of images and are unable to correct non-uniform distortions. Here, we developed a novel algorithm, PatchWarp, to robustly correct slow image distortion for calcium imaging data. PatchWarp is a two-step algorithm with rigid and non-rigid image registrations. To correct non-uniform image distortions, it splits the imaging field and estimates the best affine transformation matrix for each of the subfields. The distortion-corrected subfields are stitched together like a patchwork to reconstruct the distortion-corrected imaging field. We show that PatchWarp robustly corrects image distortions of calcium imaging data collected from various cortical areas through glass window or GRIN lens with a higher accuracy than existing non-rigid algorithms. Furthermore, it provides a fully automated method of registering images from different imaging sessions for longitudinal neural activity analyses. PatchWarp improves the quality of neural activity analyses and would be useful as a general approach to correct image distortions in a wide range of disciplines.",

Although assembled from simple metabolites and synthesized by a relatively short core biosynthetic pathway, tremendous within- and across-species acylsugar structural variation is documented across the family. To advance our understanding of the diversity and the synthesis of acylsugars within the Nicotiana genus, trichome extracts were profiled across the genus coupled with transcriptomics-guided enzyme discovery and in vivo and in vitro analysis. Differences in the types of sugar cores, numbers of acylations, and acyl chain structures contributed to over 300 unique annotated acylsugars throughout Nicotiana. Placement of acyl chain length into a phylogenetic context revealed that an unsaturated acyl chain type was detected in a few closely-related species. A comparative transcriptomics approach identified trichome-enriched Nicotiana acuminata acylsugar biosynthetic candidate enzymes. > 25 acylsugar variants could be produced in a single enzyme assay with four acylsugar acyltransferases (NacASAT1-4) together with structurally diverse acyl-CoAs and sucrose. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry screening of in vitro products revealed the ability of these enzymes to make acylsugars not present in Nicotiana plant extracts. In vitro acylsugar production also provided insights into acyltransferase acyl donor promiscuity and acyl acceptor specificity as well as regiospecificity of some ASATs. This study suggests that promiscuous Nicotiana acyltransferases can be used as synthetic biology tools to produce novel and potentially useful metabolites.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYAnalysis of Nicotiana glandular trichome metabolites and BAHD acyltransferases revealed diverse sucrose and glucose based acylesters.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of aging and life expectancy have been studied in model organisms with short lifespans. However, long-lived species may provide insights into successful strategies of healthy aging, potentially opening the door for novel therapeutic interventions in age-related diseases. Notably, naked mole-rats, the longest-lived rodent, present attenuated aging phenotypes in comparison to mice. Their resistance toward oxidative stress has been proposed as one hallmark of their healthy aging, suggesting their ability to maintain cell homeostasis, and specifically their protein homeostasis. To identify the general principles behind their protein homeostasis robustness, we compared the aggregation propensity and mutation tolerance of naked mole-rat and mouse orthologous proteins. Our analysis showed no proteome-wide differential effects in aggregation propensity and mutation tolerance between these species, but several subsets of proteins with a significant difference in aggregation propensity. We found an enrichment of proteins with higher aggregation propensity in naked mole-rat involved the inflammasome complex, and in nucleic acid binding. On the other hand, proteins with lower aggregation propensity in naked mole-rat have a significantly higher mutation tolerance compared to the rest of the proteins. Among them, we identified proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative and age-related diseases. These findings highlight the intriguing hypothesis about the capacity of the naked mole-rat proteome to delay aging through its proteomic intrinsic architecture.\n\nSignificance statementThe molecular mechanisms behind naked mole-rat longevity are still poorly understood. Here, we address how the proteome architecture can help delay the onset of aging in naked mole-rat by studying properties that modulate protein aggregation. We identify [~]1,000 proteins with significant differences in aggregation propensity and mutation tolerance involved in processes known to be dysfunctional during aging. These findings highlight how evolutionary adaptations in protein aggregation in distinct biological processes could explain naked mole-rat longevity.",

Using cell-free assays and quantitative mass spectrometry, we determined the interactome of capsid- host protein complexes of herpes simplex virus and identified the large dynamin-like GTPase myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB) as an interferon-inducible protein interacting with capsids. Electron microscopy analyses showed that cytosols containing MxB had the remarkable capability to disassemble the icosahedral capsids of herpes simplex viruses and varicella zoster virus into flat sheets of connected triangular faces. In contrast, capsids remained intact in cytosols with MxB mutants unable to hydrolyse GTP or to dimerize. Our data suggest that MxB senses herpesviral capsids, mediates their disassembly, and thereby restricts the efficiency of nuclear targeting of incoming capsids and/or the assembly of progeny capsids. The resulting premature release of viral genomes from capsids may enhance the activation of DNA sensors, and thereby amplify the innate immune responses.",

However, spatial transcriptomics technologies are limited in their ability to separate transcriptionally similar cell types and can suffer further difficulties identifying cell types in slide regions where transcript capture is low. Here, we describe a conceptually novel methodology that can computationally integrate spatial transcriptomics data with cell-type-informative paired tissue images, obtained from, for example, the reverse side of the same tissue section, to improve inferences of tissue cell type composition in spatial transcriptomics data. The underlying statistical approach is generalizable to any spatial transcriptomics protocol where informative paired tissue images can be obtained. We demonstrate a use case leveraging cell-type-specific immunofluorescence markers obtained on mouse brain tissue sections and a use case for leveraging the output of AI annotated H&E tissue images, which we used to markedly improve the identification of clinically relevant immune cell infiltration in breast cancer tissue. Thus, combining spatial transcriptomics data with paired tissue images has the potential to improve the identification of cell types and hence to improve the applications of spatial transcriptomics that rely on accurate cell type identification.",

Many anti-phage systems function by abortive infection to kill a phage-infected cell, raising the question of how they are regulated to avoid cell killing outside the context of infection. Here, we identify a transcription factor associated with the widespread CBASS bacterial immune system, that we term CapW. CapW forms a homodimer and binds a palindromic DNA sequence in the CBASS promoter region. Two crystal structures of CapW suggest that the protein switches from an unliganded, DNA binding-competent state to a ligand-bound state unable to bind DNA. We show that CapW strongly represses CBASS gene expression in uninfected cells, and that phage infection causes increased CBASS expression in a CapW-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, this CapW-dependent increase in CBASS expression is not required for robust anti-phage activity, suggesting that CapW may mediate CBASS activation and cell death in response to a signal other than phage infection. Our results parallel concurrent reports on the structure and activity of BrxR, a transcription factor associated with the BREX anti-phage system, suggesting that CapW and BrxR are members of a family of universal defense signaling proteins.",

We developed a method that leverages CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutations to identify key functional regions within protein sequences required for cellular outgrowth. Our analysis of 48 human mitotic genes revealed hundreds of regions required for cell proliferation, including known domains and uncharacterized ones. We validated the essential nature for 15 of these regions, including amino acids 387-402 of Mad1, which identified an unknown domain that contributes to Mad1 kinetochore localization and chromosome segregation fidelity.

However, the diverse impacts of antimicrobials on bacterial physiology and host immunity remain unclear. A comprehensive antibiotic screen revealed that disruption of thymidine synthesis in Firmicutes with anti-folate antibiotics promoted elevated levels of the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-AMP, and consequently induced host STING activation during infection. Extensive exposure to antibiotics targeting folate synthesis drives the emergence of thymidine-dependent Staphylococcus aureus SCVs (TD-SCVs). Respiratory infections with TD-SCVs are common among children with cystic fibrosis and are associated with worse clinical outcomes, although the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be defined. Our study reveals that TD-SCV isolates exhibited excessive c-di-AMP production and STING activation in a thymidine-dependent manner. Murine lung infection with TD-SCVs revealed STING-dependent elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to higher airway neutrophil infiltration and activation comparing to normal colony S. aureus and hemin-dependent SCV. Our results suggest the elevated inflammatory capacity of TD-SCVs contribute to their pathogenesis and revealed a new aspect of STING signaling in the airway by characterizing its role in neutrophil recruitment.",

Poor awareness and access to effective diagnosis have led to this enormous disease burden, calling for point-of-care, minimally invasive diagnosis methods. Here, an end-to-end quantitative approach for a new kind of diagnosis has been developed, comprising identification of optimal biomarkers, design of the sensor, and simulation of the diagnostic circuit. Using miRNA expression data in the public domain, we identified circulating miRNA biomarkers specific to cervical cancer using multi-tier screening. Synthetic riboregulators called toehold switches specific for the biomarker panel were then designed. To predict the dynamic range of toehold switches for use in genetic circuits as biosensors, we developed a generic grammar of these switches, and built a multivariate linear regression model using thermodynamic features derived from RNA secondary structure and interaction. The model yielded predictions of toehold efficacy with an adjusted R2 = 0.59. Reaction kinetics modelling was performed to predict the sensitivity of the second-generation toehold switches to the miRNA biomarkers. Simulations showed a linear response between 10nM and 100nM before saturation. Our study demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for the efficient design of genetic circuits geared towards the effective detection of unique genomic signatures that would be increasingly important in todays world. The approach has the potential to direct experimental efforts and minimise costs.

However, the role of the AG in semantic processing is controversial. Key controversies concern response polarity (activation vs. deactivation) and its relation to task difficulty, lateralization (left vs. right AG), and functional-anatomical subdivision (PGa vs. PGp subregions). Here, we combined the fMRI data of five studies on semantic processing (n = 172) and analyzed the response profiles from the same anatomical regions-of-interest for left and right PGa and PGp. We found that the AG was consistently deactivated during non-semantic conditions, whereas response polarity during semantic conditions was inconsistent. However, the AG consistently showed relative response differences between semantic and non-semantic conditions, and between different semantic conditions. A combined analysis across all studies revealed that AG responses could be best explained by separable effects of task difficulty and semantic processing demand. Task difficulty effects were stronger in PGa than PGp, regardless of hemisphere. Semantic effects were stronger in left than right AG, regardless of subregion. These results suggest that the AG is engaged in both domain-general task-difficulty-related processes and domain-specific semantic processes. In semantic processing, we propose that left AG acts as a \"multimodal convergence zone\" that binds different semantic features associated with the same concept, enabling efficient access to task-relevant features.",

The great efficiency of algal photosynthesis relies on a mechanism concentrating CO2 (CCM) at the catalytic site of the carboxylating enzyme RuBisCO, thus enhancing CO2 fixation2. While many cellular components involved in the transport and sequestration of inorganic carbon (Ci) have been uncovered3,4, the way microalgae supply energy to concentrate CO2 against a thermodynamic gradient remains elusive4-6. Here, by monitoring dissolved CO2 consumption, unidirectional O2 exchange and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter NPQ in the green alga Chlamydomonas, we show that the complementary effects of cyclic electron flow and O2 photoreduction, respectively mediated by PGRL1 and flavodiiron proteins, generate the proton motive force (pmf) required by Ci transport across thylakoid membranes. We demonstrate that the trans-thylakoid pmf is used by bestrophin-like Ci transporters and further establish that a chloroplast-to-mitochondria electron flow contributes to energize non-thylakoid Ci transporters, most likely by supplying ATP. We propose an integrated view of the CCM energy supply network, describing how algal cells distribute photosynthesis energy to power different Ci transporters, thus paving the way to the transfer of a functional algal CCM in plants towards improving crop productivity.\n\nOne sentence summaryPhotosynthetic alternative electron flows and mitochondrial respiration drive the algal CO2 concentrating mechanism",

Starting with FASTQ files, 20 challenge participants applied their variant calling pipelines and submitted 64 variant callsets for one or more sequencing technologies (~35X Illumina, ~35X PacBio HiFi, and ~50X Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Submissions were evaluated following best practices for benchmarking small variants with the new GIAB benchmark sets and genome stratifications. Challenge submissions included a number of innovative methods for all three technologies, with graph-based and machine-learning methods scoring best for short-read and long-read datasets, respectively. New methods out-performed the 2016 Truth Challenge winners, and new machine-learning approaches combining multiple sequencing technologies performed particularly well. Recent developments in sequencing and variant calling have enabled benchmarking variants in challenging genomic regions, paving the way for the identification of previously unknown clinically relevant variants.",

We developed vRhyme, a fast and precise software for construction of viral metagenome-assembled genomes (vMAGs). vRhyme utilizes single- or multi-sample coverage effect size comparisons between scaffolds and employs supervised machine learning to identity nucleotide feature similarities, which are compiled into iterations of weighted networks and refined bins. Using simulated viromes, we displayed superior performance of vRhyme compared to available binning tools in constructing more complete and uncontaminated vMAGs. When applied to 10,601 viral scaffolds from human skin, vRhyme advanced our understanding of resident viruses, highlighted by identification of a Herelleviridae vMAG comprised of 22 scaffolds, and another vMAG encoding a nitrate reductase metabolic gene, representing near-complete genomes post-binning. vRhyme will enable a convention of binning uncultivated viral genomes and has the potential to transform metagenome-based viral ecology.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Promoters and enhancers are sites of transcription initiation (TSSs) and carry active histone modifications, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. Yet, the principles governing the boundaries of such regulatory elements are still poorly characterized. Alu elements are good candidates for a boundary function, being highly abundant in gene-rich regions, while essentially excluded from regulatory elements. Here, we show that the interval from the TSS to the first upstream Alu accommodates all H3K4me3 and most H3K27ac marks, while excluding DNA methylation. Remarkably, the average length of this intervals greatly varies in-between tissues, being longer in stem-and shorter in immune-cells. The very shortest TSS-to-Alu intervals were observed at promoters active in T cells, particularly at immune genes, correlating with RNA polymerase II transcription through the first Alu and accumulation of H3K4me1 signal on this first Alu. Finally, DNA methylation at first-Alus was found to evolved with age, regressing from young to middle-aged, then recovering later in life. Thus, the first Alus upstream of TSSs appear as dynamic boundaries marking the transition from DNA methylation to active histone modifications at regulatory elements, while also participating in the recording of immune gene transcriptional events by positioning H3K4me1-modified nucleosomes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundLiver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk factors include chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse, whereby tumorigenesis is induced through inflammation and subsequent fibrotic response. However, a subset of HCC arises in non-cirrhotic livers. We characterized the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of non-cirrhotic HCC to identify features underlying the diseases development and progression.\n\nMethodsWhole genome and transcriptome sequencing was performed on 30 surgically resectable tumors comprised of primarily of non-cirrhotic HCC and adjacent normal tissue. Using somatic variants, capture reagents were created and employed on an additional 87 cases of mixed cirrhotic/non-cirrhotic HCC. Cases were analyzed to identify viral integrations, single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (INDELS), copy number variants, loss of heterozygosity, gene fusions, structural variants, and differential gene expression.\n\nResultsWe detected 3,750 SNVs/INDELS and extensive CNVs and expression changes. Recurrent TERT promoter mutations occurred in >52% of non-cirrhotic discovery samples. Frequently mutated genes included TP53, CTNNB1, and APOB. Cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism was significantly downregulated. Structural variants were observed at MACROD2, WDPCP and NCKAP5 in >20% of samples. Furthermore, NR1H4 fusions involving gene partners EWSR1, GNPTAB, and FNIP1 were detected and validated in 2 non-cirrhotic samples.\n\nConclusionGenomic analysis can elucidate mechanisms that may contribute to non-cirrhotic HCC tumorigenesis. The comparable mutational landscape between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCC supports previous work suggesting a convergence at the genomic level during disease progression. It is therefore possible genomic-based treatments can be applied to both HCC subtypes with progressed disease.\n\nHighlightsO_LINon-cirrhotic HCC genomically resembles cirrhotic HCC\nC_LIO_LIComprehensive genome- and transcriptome-wide profiling allows detection of novel structural variants, fusions, and undiagnosed viral infections\nC_LIO_LINR1H4 fusions may represent a novel mechanism for tumorigenesis in HCC\nC_LIO_LINon-cirrhotic HCC is characterized by genotoxic mutational signatures and dysregulated liver metabolism\nC_LIO_LIClinical history and comprehensive omic profiling incompletely explain underlying etiologies for non-cirrhotic HCC highlighting the need for further research\nC_LI\n\nShort DescriptionThis study characterizes the genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in non-cirrhotic livers. Using 117 HCCs tumor/normal pairs, we identified 3,750 SNVs/INDELS with high variant frequency in TERT, TP53, CTNNB1, and APOB.

The accumulation of single-cell data provides growing resources for constructing atlases for all cells of a human organ or the whole body. The true assembly of a cell atlas should be cell-centric rather than file-centric. We proposed a unified information framework enabling seamless cell-centric data assembly and developed a human Ensemble Cell Atlas (hECA) as an instance. hECA version 1.0 assembled scRNA-seq data across multiple studies into one orchestrated data repository. It contains 1,093,299 labeled cells and metadata from 116 published human single-cell studies, covering 38 human organs and 11 systems. We invented three methods of applications based on the cell-centric assembly: \"In data\" cell sorting enables targeted data retrieval in the full atlas with customizable logic expressions; The \"quantitative portraiture\" system provides a multi-view presentation of biological entities (organs, cell types, and genes) of multiple granularities; The customizable reference creation allows users to use the cell-centric assembly to generate references for their own cell type annotations. Case studies on agile construction of user-defined sub-atlases and \"in data\" investigation of CAR-T off-targets in multiple organs showed the great potential of cell-centric atlas assembly.",

Quantitative PCR is the gold standard tool for qNAATs; however, there is a need to develop point-of-care (POC) qNAATs to manage infectious diseases in outpatient clinics, low- and middle-income countries, and the home. Isothermal amplification methods are an emerging tool for POC NAATs as an alternative to traditional PCR-based workflows. Previous works have focused on relating isothermal amplification bulk fluorescence signals to input copies of target nucleic acids for sample quantification with limited success. In this work, we show that recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) reactions on paper membranes exhibit discrete fluorescent amplification nucleation sites. We demonstrate that the number of nucleation sites can be used to quantify HIV-1 DNA and RNA in less than 20 minutes. An image-analysis algorithm quantifies nucleation sites and determines the input nucleic acid copies in the range of 67-3,000 copies per reaction. We demonstrate a mobile phone-based system for image capture and onboard processing, illustrating that this method may be used at the point-of-care for qNAATs with minimal instrumentation.",

A striking feature of trypanosomatids is the polycistronic transcription associated with post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate the levels of translatable mRNA. In this context, epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been revealed of great importance, since they are the only ones that would control the access of RNA polymerases to chromatin. Bromodomains are epigenetic protein readers that recognize and specifically bind to acetylated lysine residues, mostly at histone proteins. There are seven coding sequences for BD-containing proteins in trypanosomatids, named TcBDF1 to TcBDF7, and a putative new protein-containing a bromodomain that was recently described. Using the Tet regulated overexpression plasmid pTcINDEX-GW and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing we were able to demonstrate the essentiality of TcBDF2 in T cruzi. This bromodomain is located in the nucleus, through a bipartite nuclear localization signal. TcBDF2 was shown to be important for host cell invasion, amastigote replication, and differentiation from amastigotes to trypomastigotes. Overexpression of TcBDF2 diminished epimastigote replication. Also, some processes involved in pathogenesis were altered in these parasites, such as infection of mammalian cells, replication of amastigotes, and the number of trypomastigotes released from host cells. In in vitro studies, TcBDF2 was also able to bind inhibitors showing a specificity profile different from that of the previously characterized TcBDF3. These results, point to TcBDF2 as a druggable target against T. cruzi.",

    "preprint_abstract": "While multiple monoamines modulate cerebellar output, the mechanistic details of dopaminergic signaling in the cerebellum remain poorly understood. Here we show that Drd1 dopamine receptors are expressed in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) of the cerebellar vermis. Drd1 activation increases UBC firing rate and postsynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated currents. Using anatomical tracing and in situ hybridization, we tested three hypotheses about the source of cerebellar dopamine. We exclude midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive Purkinje cells as potential sources, supporting the possibility of dopaminergic co-release from locus coeruleus (LC) axons. Using an optical dopamine sensor GRABDA, electrical stimulation, and optogenetic activation of LC fibers in the acute slice, we find evidence for monoamine release onto Drd1-expressing UBCs. Altogether, we propose that the LC regulates cerebellar cortex activity by co-releasing dopamine onto UBCs to modulate their response to cerebellar inputs. Purkinje neurons directly inhibit these Drd1-positive UBCs, forming a dopamine-sensitive recurrent vestibulo-cerebellar circuit.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Collective, coordinated cellular motions underpin key processes in all multicellular organisms, yet it has been difficult to express the  rules behind these motions in clear, interpretable forms. Here we apply deep attention networks to analyze several canonical living tissues systems and present the underlying collective migration rules for each tissue type using only cell migration trajectory data. We use these networks to learn the behaviors of key tissue types with distinct collective behaviors--epithelial, endothelial, and metastatic breast cancer cells--and show how the results complement traditional biophysical approaches. In particular, we present attention maps indicating the relative influence of neighboring cells to the learned turning decisions of a focal cell. These attention networks reveal distinct patterns of influence and attention unique to each model tissue. Endothelial cells exhibit tightly focused attention on their immediate forward-most neighbors, while cells in more expansile epithelial tissues are more broadly influenced by neighbors in a relatively large forward sector. Attention maps of ensembles of more mesenchymal, metastatic cells reveal completely symmetric attention patterns, indicating the lack of any particular coordination or direction of interest. Moreover, we show how attention networks are capable of detecting and learning how these rules changes based on biophysical context, such as location within the tissue and cellular crowding. That these results require only cellular trajectories and no modeling assumptions highlights the potential of attention networks for providing further biological insights into complex cellular systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryCollective behaviors are crucial to the function of multicellular life, with large-scale, coordinated cell migration enabling processes spanning organ formation to coordinated skin healing. However, we lack effective tools to discover and cleanly express collective rules at the level of an individual cell. Here, we employ a carefully structured neural network to extract collective information directly from cell trajectory data. The network is trained on data from various systems, including well-studied cell types (HUVEC and MDCK cells) which display visually distinct forms of collective motion, and metastatic cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) which are highly uncoordinated. Using these trained networks, we can produce attention maps for each system, which indicate how a cell within a tissue takes in information from its surrounding neighbors, as a function of weights assigned to those neighbors. Thus for a cell type in which cells tend to follow the path of the cell in front, the attention maps will display high weights for cells spatially forward of the focal cell. We present results in terms of additional metrics, such as accuracy plots and number of interacting cells, and encourage future development of improved metrics.",

These massive datasets are usually collected from many samples using different scRNA-seq technology platforms, including the popular SMART-Seq2 (SS2) and 10X platforms. Inherent heterogeneities between platforms, tissues, and other batch effects makes scRNA-seq data difficult to compare and integrate, especially in large-scale cell atlas efforts; yet, accurate integration is essential for gaining deeper insights into cell biology. Through comprehensive data exploration, we found that accurate integration is often hampered by differences in cell-type compositions. Herein we describe FIRM, an algorithm that addresses this problem and achieves efficient and accurate integration of heterogeneous scRNA-seq datasets across multiple tissue types, platforms, and experimental batches. We applied FIRM to numerous large-scale scRNA-seq datasets from mouse, mouse lemur, and human, comparing its performance in dataset integration with other state-of-the-art methods. FIRM-integrated datasets show accurate mixing of shared cell type identities and superior preservation of original structure without overcorrection, generating robust integrated datasets for downstream exploration and analysis. It is also a facile way to transfer cell type labels and annotations from one dataset to another, making it a reliable and versatile tool for scRNA-seq analysis, especially for cell atlas data integration.",

The present study explores the effect of propionate on neurological deficits, cerebral blood flow, and oxidative stress in diabetic mice. Propionate can markedly improve neurological function, which is correlated with its capabilities of stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production, increasing cerebral microcirculation, suppressing oxidative stress and reducing neuron loss in the hippocampus. In addition, the results of Western Blotting indicated that the brain-protective function of propionate in streptozocin (STZ)-induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) mice is related to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine protein kinase (Akt)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase(eNOS) signaling pathway. In a diabetic mouse model, propionate reduces cerebral microcirculation, hippocampus apoptosis, and neurological impairment. Thus, propionate, now employed as a food preservative, may also help slow diabetes-induced cognitive loss.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/464493v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81fa09org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1469451org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b37fa1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8037e7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIPropionate ameliorates diabetic-induced depression-like behavior, spatial learning and memory deficits.\nC_LIO_LIPropionate increases cerebral microcirculation by enhancing NO production in diabetic mice.\nC_LIO_LIPropionate suppresses oxidative stress and reduces neuron loss in the hippocampus.\nC_LIO_LIThe brain-protective function of propionate is related to PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "While essential to our understanding of solid tumor progression, the study of cell and tissue mechanics has yet to find traction in the clinic. Determining tissue stiffness, a mechanical property known to promote a malignant phenotype in vitro and in vivo, is not part of the standard algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Instead, clinicians routinely use mammograms to identify malignant lesions and radiographically dense breast tissue is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Whether breast density is related to tumor tissue stiffness, and what cellular and non-cellular components of the tumor contribute the most to its stiffness are not well understood. Through training of a deep learning network and mechanical measurements of fresh patient tissue, we create a bridge in understanding between clinical and mechanical markers. The automatic identification of cellular and extracellular features from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides reveals that global and local breast tissue stiffness best correlate with the percentage of straight collagen. Global breast tissue mechanics correlate weakly with the percentage of blood vessels and fibrotic tissue, and non-significantly with the percentage of fat, ducts, tumor cells, and wavy collagen in tissue. Importantly, the percentage of dense breast tissue does not directly correlate with tissue stiffness or straight collagen content.",

The altered gene expression of virus-infected host cells provides an opportunity to specifically inhibit viral propagation via targeting the synthetic lethal (SL) partners of such altered host genes. Pursuing this antiviral strategy, here we comprehensively analyzed multiple in vitro and in vivo bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict clinically relevant candidate antiviral targets that are SL with altered host genes. The predicted SL-based targets are highly enriched for infected cell inhibiting genes reported in four SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide genetic screens. Integrating our predictions with the results of these screens, we further selected a focused subset of 26 genes that we experimentally tested in a targeted siRNA screen using human Caco-2 cells. Notably, as predicted, knocking down these targets reduced viral replication and cell viability only under the infected condition without harming non-infected cells.

PTHrP is also produced by breast cancers and GWAS studies suggest that it influences breast cancer risk. However, the exact functions of PTHrP in breast cancer biology remain unsettled.\n\nMethodsWe developed a tetracyline-regulated, MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus)-driven model of PTHrP overexpression in mammary epithelial cells (Tet-PTHrP mice) and bred these mice with the MMTV-PyMT (polyoma middle tumor-antigen) breast cancer model to analyze the impact of PTHrP overexpression on normal mammary gland biology and in breast cancer progression.\n\nResultsOverexpression of PTHrP in luminal epithelial cells caused alveolar hyperplasia and secretory differentiation of the mammary epithelium with milk production. This was accompanied by activation of Stat5 and increased expression of E74-like factor-5 (Elf5). In MMTV-PyMT mice, overexpression of PTHrP (Tet-PTHrP;PyMT mice) shortened tumor latency and accelerated tumor growth, ultimately reducing overall survival. Tumors overproducing PTHrP also displayed increased expression of nuclear pSTAT5 and Elf5, increased expression of markers of secretory differentiation and milk constituents, and histologically resembled secretory carcinomas of the breast. Overexpression of PTHrP within cells isolated from tumors, but not PTHrP exogenously added to cell culture media, led to activation of STAT5 and milk protein gene expression. In addition, neither ablating the Type 1 PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) in epithelial cells or treating Tet-PTHrP;PyMT mice with an anti-PTH1R antibody prevented secretory differentiation or altered tumor latency. These data suggest that PTHrP acts in a cell-autonomous, intracrine manner. Finally, expression of PTHrP in human breast cancers is associated with expression of genes involved in milk production and STAT5 signaling.\n\nConclusionsOur study suggests that PTHrP promotes pathways leading to secretory differentiation and proliferation in both normal mammary epithelial cells and in breast tumor cells.",

We devised a single-interval task where observers discriminated the slant of a densely textured planar test surface relative to a textured planar surround reference surface. Although surfaces were rendered with correct perspective, the stimuli were designed so that the binocular cues dominated performance. Slant discrimination performance was measured as a function of the reference slant and the level of uncorrelated white noise added to the test-plane images in the left and right eye. We compared human performance with an approximate ideal observer (planar cross correlation, PCC) and two sub-ideal observers. The PCC observer uses the image in one eye and back projection to predict the test image in the other eye for all possible slants, tilts, and distances. The estimated slant, tilt, and distance are determined by the prediction that most closely matches the measured image in the other eye. The first sub-ideal observer (local PCC, LPCC) applies planar cross correlation over local neighborhoods and then pools estimates across the test plane. The second sub-optimal observer (standard cross correlation, SCC), uses only positional disparity information. We find that the ideal observer (PCC) and the first sub-ideal observer (LPCC) outperform the second sub-ideal observer (SCC), demonstrating the benefits of structural disparities. We also find that all three model observers can account for human performance, if two free parameters are included: a fixed small level of internal estimation noise, and a fixed overall efficiency scalar on slant discriminability.\n\nPrecisWe measured human stereo slant discrimination thresholds for accurately-rendered textured surfaces designed so that performance is dominated by binocular-disparity cues.

Our inferences of the phylogenies and population structure revealed clearly high genetic and DNA methylomic divergence across the three lineages. By multi-levelled genome-wide scanning, we identified candidate genes exhibiting lineage-specific genetic or epigenetic variation patterns that are signatures of inter-specific divergence. We demonstrated that these species diversification-associated genetic variations and epigenetic variabilities were partially independent but were both functionally related to various biological processes vital to adaptation, including stress tolerance, cell reproduction and DNA repair.

    "preprint_abstract": "Fast-moving animals need fast-acting sensory systems. Flying insects have thus evolved exceptionally quick visual (1) and olfactory processing ability (2). For example, flighted insects can track the temporal structure of turbulent odor plumes at rates above 100 Hz (3). The evolutionary lability of such sensory systems, however, remains unknown. We test for rapid evolutionary shifts in olfactory processing speed associated with flight loss, through neurobiological comparisons of sympatric flighted versus flightless lineages within a wing-polymorphic stonefly species. Our analyses of sensory responses reveal that recently-evolved flightless lineages have substantially degraded olfactory acuity. By comparing flighted versus flightless ecotypes with similar genetic backgrounds (4), we eliminate other confounding factors that might have affected the evolution of their olfactory reception mechanisms. Our detection of different patterns of degraded olfactory sensitivity and speed in independently wing-reduced lineages highlights parallel evolution of sensory degeneration. These reductions in sensory ability also echo the rapid vestigialization of wings themselves (4, 5), and represent a neurobiological parallel to the convergent phenotypic shifts seen under sharp selective gradients in other systems (e.g. parallel loss of vision in diverse cave fauna (6)). Our study provides the first direct evidence for the hypothesis that flight poses a selective pressure on the speed of olfactory receptor neurons. Our findings also emphasize the energetic costs of rapid olfaction, and the key role of natural selection in shaping dramatic neurobiological shifts.\n\nSignificance StatementFlying insects move fast and have therefore evolved exceptionally quick-acting sensory systems. The speed with which such neurobiological shifts can evolve, however, remains unclear. Under the  use it or lose it hypothesis, loss of flight should lead to degradation of this fast sensory processing ability. We test for evolutionary reductions in olfactory acuity linked to flight loss, through neurobiological comparisons of flightless versus flighted lineages within a wing-polymorphic insect. Our analyses reveal that newly wing-reduced populations have substantially degraded olfactory acuity, with parallel reductions in this sensory ability detected in independently flightless lineages. These findings reveal that flight poses strong selective pressure for rapid olfaction, and highlight the potential of natural selection in rapidly shaping adaptive shifts in animal sensory systems.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Environmental stress can result in epigenetic modifications that are passed down several generations. Such epigenetic inheritance can have significant impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics, but the phenomenon remains controversial in ecological model systems. Here, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on individual water fleas (Daphnia magna) to assess whether environmentally-induced DNA methylation can persist for up to four generations. Genetically identical females were exposed to a control treatment, one of three natural stressors (high temperature, zinc, microcystin), or the methylation-inhibitor 5-azacytidine. After exposure, lines were propagated clonally for four generations under control conditions. We identified between 70 and 225 differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) between controls and F1 individuals whose mothers (and therefore they themselves as germ cells) were exposed to one of the three natural stressors. Between 46% and 58% of these environmentally-induced DMPs persisted until generation F4 without attenuation in their magnitude of differential methylation. DMPs were enriched in exons and largely stressor-specific, suggesting a possible role in environment-dependent gene regulation. In contrast, treatment with the compound 5-azacytidine demonstrated that pervasive hypo-methylation upon exposure is reset almost completely after a single generation. These results suggest that environmentally-induced DNA methylation is non-random and stably inherited across generations in Daphnia, making epigenetic inheritance a putative factor in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of fresh-water communities.\n\nAuthor summaryWater fleas are important keystone species mediating eco-evolutionary dynamics in lakes and ponds. It is currently an open question in how far epigenetic inheritance contributes to the ability of Daphnia populations to adapt to environmental stress. Using a range of naturally occurring stressors and a multi-generational design, we show that environmentally-induced DNA methylation variants are stably inherited for at least four generations in Daphnia magna. The induced variation in DNA methylation are stressor-specific and almost exclusively found in exons, bearing the signatures of functional adaptations. Our findings imply that ecological adaptations of Daphnia to seasonal fluctuations can be underpinned by epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation without changes in gene frequencies.",

Immune checkpoint blockade agents target inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, on exhausted CD8+ T cells to restore their anti-cancer function. Many patients, however, either do not respond or progress after an initial response to immune checkpoint blockade, and distant intracranial failure is common despite excellent options for local treatment of brain metastasis. To develop more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain metastases, an understanding of the phenotype of brain metastasis-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is essential. Here we performed a detailed characterization of the CD8+ T cells contained in brain metastases. Brain metastases were densely infiltrated by CD8+ T cells; blood contamination of tumor samples was rare. Compared to patient-matched circulating cells, brain metastasis-infiltrating CD8+ T cells had a distinct phenotype characterized by more frequent expression of PD-1, with subpopulations defined by expression of additional co-inhibitory molecules and the residence marker CD69. Single cell RNA-sequencing identified four phenotypic subpopulations within brain metastasis-infiltrating PD-1+ CD8+ T cells. Two of these populations -- a terminally-differentiated and a dividing population -- were characterized by high expression of co-inhibitory molecules and lacked expression of progenitor markers such as TCF-1. There was significant T cell receptor (TCR) overlap between the terminally-differentiated and dividing populations, suggesting that the dividing cells give rise to the terminally-differentiated cells. There was minimal TCR overlap between these two populations and other brain metastasis-infiltrating PD-1+ CD8+ T cells. T cell clones from brain metastasis-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were rare in circulation, particularly clones from the terminally-differentiated and dividing populations. We systematically identified bystander CD8+ T cells specific for microbial antigens; these cells infiltrated brain metastases and expressed genes shared with exhausted progenitor CD8+ T cells, such as TCF7 and IL7R. We performed spatial transcriptomics on brain metastases and used a novel method to obtain TCR sequences from spatial transcriptomics data. These data revealed distinct niches within the TME defined by their gene expression patterns and cytokine profiles. Terminally-differentiated CD8+ T cells preferentially occupied niches within the tumor parenchyma. Together, our results show that antigen-specificity restricts the spatial localization, phenotypic states, and differentiation pathways available to CD8+ T cells within the brain metastasis TME.",

In its canonical form, stress-sensing kinases phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2-P), which ultimately leads to reduced levels of ternary complex required for initiation of mRNA translation. Translational control is primarily exerted through a conformational switch in eIF2s nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, which shifts from its active A-State conformation to its inhibited I-State conformation upon eIF2-P binding, resulting in reduced nucleotide exchange on eIF2. Here, we show functionally and structurally how a single histidine to aspartate point mutation in eIF2Bs {beta} subunit (H160D) mimics the effects of eIF2-P binding by promoting an I-State like conformation, resulting in eIF2-P independent activation of the ISR.

    "preprint_abstract": "Although SARS-CoV-2 severe infection is associated with a hyperinflammatory state, lymphopenia is an immunological hallmark, and correlates with poor prognosis in COVID-19. However, it remains unknown if circulating human lymphocytes and monocytes are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. We found that in vitro infection of whole PBMCs from healthy donors was productive of virus progeny. Results revealed that monocytes, as well as B and T lymphocytes, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 active infection and viral replication was indicated by detection of double-stranded RNA. Moreover, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was frequently detected in monocytes and B lymphocytes from COVID-19 patients, and less frequently in CD4+T lymphocytes. The rates of SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients increased over time from symptom onset. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-positive monocytes and B and CD4+T lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry in post mortem lung tissue. SARS-CoV-2 infection of blood circulating leukocytes in COVID-19 patients may have important implications for disease pathogenesis, immune dysfunction, and virus spread within the host.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In colonies of the filamentous multicellular bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor, a sub-population of cells arise that hyper-produce metabolically costly antibiotics, resulting in division of labor that maximizes colony fitness. Because these cells contain large genomic deletions that cause massive reductions to individual fitness, their behavior is altruistic, much like worker castes in social insects or somatic cells in multicellular organisms. To understand the reproductive and genomic fate of these mutant cells after their emergence, we use experimental evolution by serially transferring populations via spore-to-spore transfer for 25 cycles, reflective of the natural mode of bottlenecked transmission for these spore-forming bacteria. We show that, in contrast to wild-type cells, altruistic mutant cells continue to significantly decline in fitness during transfer while they delete larger and larger fragments from their chromosome ends. In addition, altruistic mutants acquire a roughly 10-fold increase in their base-substitution rates possibly due to mutations in genes for DNA replication and repair. Ecological damage, caused by reduced sporulation, coupled with irreversible DNA damage due to point mutations and deletions, leads to an inevitable and irreversible type of mutational meltdown in these cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the altruistic cells arising in this division of labor are analogous to reproductively sterile castes of social insects.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Improving our understanding of host-microbe relationships in the gut requires the ability to both visualize and quantify the spatial organization of microbial communities in their native orientation with the host tissue. We developed a systematic procedure to quantify the 3D spatial structure of the native mucosal microbiota in any part of the intestines with taxonomic and high spatial resolution. We performed a 3D biogeographical analysis of the microbiota of mouse cecal crypts at different stages of antibiotic exposure. By tracking eubacteria and four dominant bacterial taxa, we found that the colonization of crypts by native bacteria is a dynamic and spatially organized process. Ciprofloxacin treatment drastically reduced bacterial loads and eliminated Muribaculaceae (or all Bacteroidetes entirely) even 10 days after recovery when overall bacterial loads returned to pre-antibiotic levels. Our 3D quantitative imaging approach revealed that the bacterial colonization of crypts is organized in a spatial pattern that consists of clusters of adjacent colonized crypts that are surrounded by unoccupied crypts, and that this spatial pattern was resistant to the elimination of Muribaculaceae or of all Bacteroidetes by ciprofloxacin. Our approach also revealed that the composition of cecal crypt communities is diverse and that bacterial taxa are distributed differently within crypts, with Lactobacilli laying closer to the lumen than Bacteroidetes, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. Finally, we found that crypts communities with similar taxonomic composition were physically closer to each other than communities that were taxonomically different.\n\nSignificance StatementMany human diseases are causally linked to the gut microbiota, yet the field still lacks mechanistic understanding of the underlying complex interactions because existing tools cannot simultaneously quantify microbial communities and their intact native context. In this work, we provide a new approach to tissue clearing and preservation that enables visualization, in 3D and at scales ranging from centimeters to micrometers, of the complete biogeography of the host-microbiota interface. We combine this new tool with sequencing and multiplexed labelling of the microbiota to provide the field with a platform on which to discover patterns in the spatial distribution of microbes. We validated this platform by quantifying the distribution of bacteria in the cecal mucosa at different stages of antibiotic exposure. This approach will enable researchers to formulate and test new hypotheses about host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions.",

Aneuploidy patterns are heterogeneous, posing a challenge to identify drivers in this high-noise genetic environment.

    "preprint_abstract": "Fluid lipid bilayers are the building blocks of biological membranes. Although there is a large amount of experimental data using inconsistent quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) techniques to study membranes, very little theoretical works have been developed to study the local dynamics of membranes. The main objective of this work is to build a theoretical framework to study and describe the local dynamics of lipids and derive analytical expressions of inconsistent diffusion functions (ISF) for QENS. As results, we developed the dynamical Matryoshka model which describes the local dynamics of lipid molecules in membrane layers as a nested hierarchical convolution of three motional processes: (i) individual motions described by the vibrational motions of H-atoms; (ii) internal motions including movements of the lipid backbone, head groups and tails, and (iii) molecule movements of the lipid molecule as a whole. The analytical expressions of the ISF associated with these movements are all derived. For use in analyzing the QENS experimental data, we also derived an analytical expression for the aggregate ISF of the Matryoshka model which involves an elastic term plus three inelastic terms of well-separated time scales and whose amplitudes and rates are functions of the lipid motions. And as an illustrative application, we used the aggregated ISF to analyze the experimental QENS data on a lipid sample of multilamellar bilayers of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). It is clear from this analysis that the dynamical Matryoshka model describes very well the experimental data and allow extracting the dynamical parameters of the studied system.",

Most SARS-CoV-2 protective antibodies target the receptor- binding domain or a single dominant epitope ( supersite) on the N terminal domain (NTD). Here, using the single B cell technology LIBRA-seq, we isolated a large panel of NTD-reactive and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from an individual who had recovered from COVID-19. We found that neutralizing antibodies to the NTD supersite commonly are encoded by the IGHV1-24 gene, forming a genetic cluster that represents a public B cell clonotype. However, we also discovered a rare human antibody, COV2-3434, that recognizes a site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the trimer interface and possesses a distinct class of functional activity. COV2-3434 disrupted the integrity of S protein trimers, inhibited cell-to-cell spread of virus in culture, and conferred protection in human ACE2 transgenic mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. This study provides insight about antibody targeting of the S protein trimer interface region, suggesting this region may be a site of virus vulnerability.",

Mutations that accumulate in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in somatic cells have been implicated in cancer, degenerative diseases, and the aging process. However, the mechanisms used by somatic cells to maintain proper functions despite their mtDNA mutation load are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed somatic mtDNA mutations in more than 30,000 human single peripheral and bone marrow mononuclear cells and observed a significant overrepresentation of homoplastic mtDNA mutations in B, T and NK lymphocytes despite their lower mutational burden than other hematopoietic cells. The characteristic mutational landscape of mtDNA in lymphocytes were validated with data from multiple platforms and individuals. Single-cell RNA-seq and computational modeling demonstrated a stringent mitochondrial bottleneck during lymphocyte development likely caused by lagging mtDNA replication relative to cell proliferation. These results illuminate a potential mechanism used by highly metabolically active immune cells for quality control of their mitochondrial genomes.",

In some crops, awns appear to have been eliminated during domestication. Although numerous genes involved in awn development have been identified, several dominant genes that eliminate awns are also known to exist. For example, in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), the dominant awn inhibiting gene has been known since 1921; however, its molecular features remain uncharacterized. In this study, we conducted quantitative trait locus analysis and a genome-wide association study of awn-related traits in sorghum and identified DOMINANT AWN INHIBITOR (DAI), which encodes the ALOG family protein on chromosome 3. DAI appeared to be present in most awnless sorghum cultivars, likely because of its effectiveness. Detailed analysis of the ALOG protein family in cereals revealed that DAI originated from duplication of its twin paralog (DAIori) on chromosome 10. Observations of immature awns in near-isogenic lines revealed that DAI inhibits awn elongation by suppressing both cell proliferation and elongation. We also found that only DAI gained a novel function to inhibit awn elongation through an awn-specific expression pattern distinct from that of DAIori. Interestingly, heterologous expression of DAI with its own promoter in rice inhibited awn elongation in the awned cultivar Kasalath. We found that DAI originated from gene duplication, providing an interesting example of gain-of-function that occurs only in sorghum but shares its functionality with rice and sorghum.",

We used marmoset monkey vocal production to explore this putative influence of arousal on the nonlinear changes in their developing vocal output patterns. Based on a detailed analysis of vocal and arousal dynamics in marmosets, we put forth a general model incorporating arousal and auditory-feedback loops for spontaneous vocal production. Using this model, we show that a stable oscillation can emerge as the baseline arousal increases, predicting the transition from stochastic to periodic oscillations observed during marmoset vocal development. We further provide a solution for how this model can explain vocal development as the joint consequence of energetic growth and social feedback.

    "preprint_abstract": "Fluid shear stress is an important mediator of vascular permeability, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of the blood-brain barrier to shear have yet to be studied in cerebral vasculature despite its importance for brain homeostasis. The goal of this study is to probe components of shear mechanotransduction within the blood-brain barrier to gain a better understanding of pathologies associated with changes in cerebral blood flow including ischemic stroke. Interrogating the effects of shear stress in vivo is complicated by the complexity of factors in the brain parenchyma and the difficulty associated with modulating blood flow regimes. Recent advances in the ability to mimic the in vivo microenvironment using three-dimensional in vitro models provide a controlled setting to study the response of the blood-brain barrier to shear stress. The in vitro model used in this study is compatible with real-time measurement of barrier function using transendothelial electrical resistance as well as immunocytochemistry and dextran permeability assays. These experiments reveal that there is a threshold level of shear stress required for barrier formation and that the composition of the extracellular matrix, specifically the presence of hyaluronan, dictates the flow response. Gene editing to modulate the expression of CD44, a receptor for hyaluronan that previous studies have identified to be mechanosensitive, demonstrates that the receptor is required for the endothelial response to shear stress. Manipulation of small GTPase activity reveals CD44 activates Rac1 while inhibiting RhoA activation. Additionally, adducin-{gamma} localizes to tight junctions in response to shear stress and RhoA inhibition and is required to maintain the barrier. This study identifies specific components of the mechanosensing complex associated with the blood-brain barrier response to fluid shear stress, and therefore illuminates potential targets for barrier manipulation in vivo.",

Brain stimulation has been shown to alter large-scale network-wide functional connectivity, but the mapping from stimulation to the modification is unclear. Here, we leverage advances in neural interfaces, interpretable machine learning, and graph theory to arrive at a model which accurately predicts stimulation-induced network-wide functional reorganization. The model jointly considers the stimulation protocol and the cortical network structure, departing from the standard approach which only considers the stimulation protocol. We validate our approach in the primary sensorimotor cortex of non-human primates using paired optogenetic stimulation through a large-scale optogenetic interface. We observe that the stimulation protocol only predicts a small portion of the induced functional connectivity changes while the network structure predicts much more, indicating that the underlying network is the primary mediator of the response to stimulation. We extract the relationships linking the stimulation and network characteristics to the functional connectivity changes and observe that the mappings diverge over frequency bands and successive stimulations. Finally, we uncover shared processes governing real-time and longer-term effects of stimulation. Our framework represents a paradigm shift for targeted neural stimulation and can be used to interrogate, improve, and develop stimulation-based interventions for neural disorders.\n\nTeaserBrain stimulation rewires the brain, but the pre-existing network structure of the brain controls the rewiring.",

This mismatch between geographical and bioclimatic limits is mediated by the shape of the bioclimatic limit and may be significant for low growth sensitivity and fast dispersal life strategy. These findings challenge one of the core assumptions of the bioclimatic models.

We have fully decoded the immune synapses for multiple TCRs from acute patients, including cognate peptides and the presenting HLA alleles. Furthermore, using a newly developed mammalian epitope display platform (MEDi), we determined that several mutations present in multiple viral isolates currently expanding across the globe, resulted in reduced presentation by multiple HLA class II alleles, while some increased presentation, suggesting immune evasion based on shifting MHC-II peptide presentation landscapes. In support, we found that one of the mutations present in B1.1.7 viral strain could cause escape from CD4 T cell recognition in this way. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms more broadly, we used MEDi to generate a comprehensive analysis of the presentability of all SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the context of multiple common HLA class II molecules. Unlike other strategies, our approach is sensitive and scalable, providing an unbiased and affordable high-resolution map of peptide presentation capacity for any MHC-II allele. Such information is essential to provide insight into T cell immunity across distinct HLA haplotypes across geographic and ethnic populations. This knowledge is critical for the development of effective T cell therapeutics not just against COVID-19, but any disease.",

Among the components of these contacts, the VAP family comprises endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored proteins, such as MOSPD2, functioning as major ER-organelle tethers. MOSPD2 distinguishes itself from the other members of the VAP family by the presence of a CRAL-TRIO domain. In this study, we show that MOSPD2 forms ER-LD contacts thanks to its CRAL-TRIO domain. MOSPD2 ensures the attachment of the ER to LDs through a direct protein-membrane interaction involving an amphipathic helix that has an affinity for lipid packing defects present at the surface of LDs. Remarkably, the absence of MOSPD2 markedly disturbs the assembly of lipid droplets. These data show that MOSPD2, in addition to being a general ER receptor for inter-organelle contacts, possesses an additional tethering activity and is specifically implicated in the biology of LDs via its CRAL-TRIO domain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "A critical manipulation used to study the neural basis of working memory (WM) is to vary the information load at encoding followed by measurements of activity and connectivity during maintenance in the subsequent delay period. The hallmark finding is that delay period activity and connectivity increases between frontal and parietal brain regions as load is increased. Most WM studies, however, employ simple stimuli (e.g., simple shapes or letters) during encoding and utilize unfilled intervals (e.g., a blank screen or fixation cross) during the delays. In the present study, we asked how delay period activity and connectivity change during low and high load maintenance of complex stimuli. Twenty-two participants completed a modified Sternberg WM task with two or five naturalistic scenes as stimuli while scalp EEG was recorded. In each trial, the delay interval was filled with phase scrambled scenes to provide a visual perceptual control with color and spatial frequency similar to the non-scrambled scenes presented during encoding. The results showed that theta and alpha delay activity amplitude was reduced during high compared to low WM load across frontal, central, and parietal sources. Functional connectivity during the delay was assessed by phase-locking value (PLV) and revealed a network with higher connectivity during low WM load consisting of increased PLV between 1) left frontal and right posterior temporal sources in the theta and alpha bands, 2) right anterior temporal and left central sources in the alpha and lower beta bands, and 3) left anterior temporal and posterior temporal sources in the theta, alpha, and lower beta bands. These findings demonstrate a role for interhemispheric connectivity during WM maintenance of complex stimuli. We discuss significance with respect to allocation of limited attentional resources and the filtering of interference.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe coronavirus nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is a cysteine protease required for processing the viral polyprotein and is therefore crucial for viral replication. Nsp5 from several coronaviruses have also been found to cleave host proteins, disrupting molecular pathways involved in innate immunity. Nsp5 from the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with and can cleave human proteins, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Based on the continuing global pandemic, and emerging understanding of coronavirus Nsp5-human protein interactions, we set out to predict what human proteins are cleaved by the coronavirus Nsp5 protease using a bioinformatics approach.\n\nResultsUsing a previously developed neural network trained on coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage sites (NetCorona), we made predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in all human proteins. Structures of human proteins in the Protein Data Bank containing a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site were then examined, generating a list of 92 human proteins with a highly predicted and accessible cleavage site. Of those, 48 are expected to be found in the same cellular compartment as Nsp5. Analysis of this targeted list of proteins revealed molecular pathways susceptible to Nsp5 cleavage and therefore relevant to coronavirus infection, including pathways involved in mRNA processing, cytokine response, cytoskeleton organization, and apoptosis.\n\nConclusionsThis study combines predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in human proteins with protein structure information and protein network analysis. We predicted cleavage sites in proteins recently shown to be cleaved in vitro by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5, and we discuss how other potentially cleaved proteins may be relevant to coronavirus mediated immune dysregulation. The data presented here will assist in the design of more targeted experiments, to determine the role of coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage of host proteins, which is relevant to understanding the molecular pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In some animal groups, such as spiders, it is difficult or impossible to identify the sex of juveniles based on external morphology. This information would be useful for field surveys, behavioral experiments, and ecological studies on e.g. sex ratios and dispersal. In species with sex chromosomes, sex can be determined based on the specific sex chromosome complement. Additionally, information on the sequence of sex chromosomes provides the basis for studying sex chromosome evolution. We combined cytogenetic and genomic data to identify the sex chromosomes in the sexually dimorphic spider Argiope bruennichi, and designed RT-qPCR sex markers. We found that genome size and GC content of this spider falls into the range reported for the majority of araneids. The male karyotype is formed by 24 acrocentric chromosomes with an X1X20 sex chromosome system, with little similarity between X chromosomes, suggesting origin of these chromosomes by X chromosome fission or early duplication of an X chromosome and subsequent independent differentiation of the copies. Our data suggest similarly sized X chromosomes in A. bruennichi. They are smaller chromosomes of the complement.

    "preprint_abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely used in a broad range of gene-editing applications. While this gene-editing technique is quite accurate in the target region, there may be many unplanned off-target edited sites. Consequently, a plethora of computational methods have been developed to predict off-target cleavage sites given a guide RNA and a reference genome. However, these methods are based on small-scale datasets (only tens to hundreds of off-target sites) produced by experimental techniques to detect off-target sites with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Recently, CHANGE-seq, a new in vitro experimental technique to detect off-target sites, was used to produce a dataset of unprecedented scale and quality (more than 200,000 off-target sites over 110 guide RNAs). In addition, the same study included GUIDE-seq experiments for 58 of the guide RNAs to produce in vivo measurements of off-target sites. Here, we fill the gap in previous computational methods by utilizing these data to perform a systematic evaluation of data processing and formulation of the CRISPR off-target site prediction problem. Our evaluations show that data transformation as a pre-processing phase is critical prior to model training. Moreover, we demonstrate the improvement gained by adding potential inactive off-target sites to the training datasets. Furthermore, our results point to the importance of adding the number of mismatches between the guide RNA and the off-target site as a feature. Finally, we present predictive off-target in vivo models based on transfer learning from in vitro. Our conclusions will be instrumental to any future development of an off-target predictor based on high-throughput datasets.",

It has been proposed that extensive LCD-LCD interactions culminating in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TFs is the dominant mechanism underlying transactivation. Here, we investigated how tuning the amount and localization of LCD-LCD interactions in vivo affects transcription of endogenous human genes. Quantitative single-cell and single-molecule imaging reveals that the oncogenic TF EWS/FLI1 requires a finely tuned range of LCD-LCD interactions to efficiently activate target genes. Modest or more dramatic increases in LCD-LCD interactions toward putative LLPS repress EWS/FLI1-driven transcription in patient cells. Likewise, ectopically creating LCD-LCD interactions to sequester EWS/FLI1 into a bona fide LLPS compartment, the nucleolus, inhibits EWS/FLI1-driven transcription and oncogenic transformation. Our findings reveal fundamental principles underlying LCD-mediated transcription and suggest mislocalizing specific LCD-LCD interactions as a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting disease-causing TFs.",

We show that CAR T cell-mediated trogocytosis can be dramatically reduced across a wide range of B cell malignancies by replacing FMC63 with a low affinity CD19 antibody. This reduction in trogocytosis does not alter the direct anti-tumor activity of CD19 CAR T cells but prevents the emergence of antigen-negative tumor cells and significantly increases CAR T cell viability by reducing fratricide of CD19 CAR T cells following trogocytosis.\n\nTEASERA reduction in CAR affinity does not affect tumor killing but prolongs T cell persistence and prevents antigen-negative tumor escape.",

FD results from a mutation in the gene ELP1, whose encoded protein is a scaffolding subunit of the six subunit Elongator complex. In mice, we and others have shown that Elp1 is essential for the normal development of neural crest derived-dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Whether Elp1 is also required for development of ectodermal placode-derived visceral sensory receptors which are required for normal baroreception and chemosensory responses, has not been investigated. Using mouse models for FD, our data indicate that in fact the entire circuitry underlying baroreception and chemoreception is impaired due to a requirement for Elp1 not only in the visceral sensory neuron ganglia, but also for normal peripheral target innervation, and in their CNS synaptic partners in the medulla. Thus Elp1 is required in both placode- and neural crest-derived sensory neurons and its reduction aborts the normal development of neuronal circuitry essential for autonomic homeostasis and interoception.\n\nSummary statementDue to faulty afferent sensory signaling, patients with Familial dysautonomia (FD) have a diminished sensory arm of the baroreflex which would normally modulate blood pressure, and they have a blunted response to hypoxia and hypercapnia (Norcliffe-Kaufmann et al. 2010). Using mouse models for FD, we reveal here the underlying pathology which may underlie these severely impaired homeostatic reflex pathways in FD.",

Intriguingly, many microbes in the digestive tract do not maintain a constant level of their relative abundance but show daily oscillations under normal conditions. Recent evidence indicates that chronic jetlag, constant darkness, or deletion of the circadian core gene can alter the composition of gut microbiota and dampen the daily oscillation of gut microbes. These studies suggest that the interaction between the host circadian clock and the light-dark cycle plays an important role in gut homeostasis and microbiota. However, how or whether environmental factors such as the light-dark cycle could modulate gut microbiota is still poorly understood. Using genetic mouse models and 16s rRNA metagenomic analysis, we found that light-dark cycle information transmitted by the ipRGC-sympathetic circuit was essential for daily oscillations of gut microbes under temporal restricted high fat diet condition. Furthermore, aberrant light exposure such as dim light at night (dLAN), acting through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), could alter the composition, relative abundance, and daily oscillations of gut microbiota. Together, our results indicate that external stimulation, such as light-dark cycle information, through the sensory system can modulate gut microbiota in the direction from the brain to the gut.",

Blocking either viral replication with Remdesivir21-23 or the downstream IFN stimulated cascade with anti-IFNAR2 in vivo in the chronic stages of disease attenuated the overactive immune-inflammatory response, especially inflammatory macrophages. Here, we show SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in lung-resident human macrophages is a critical driver of disease. In response to infection mediated by CD16 and ACE2 receptors, human macrophages activate inflammasomes, release IL-1 and IL-18 and undergo pyroptosis thereby contributing to the hyperinflammatory state of the lungs. Inflammasome activation and its accompanying inflammatory response is necessary for lung inflammation, as inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway reverses chronic lung pathology. Remarkably, this same blockade of inflammasome activation leads to the release of infectious virus by the infected macrophages. Thus, inflammasomes oppose host infection by SARS-CoV-2 by production of inflammatory cytokines and suicide by pyroptosis to prevent a productive viral cycle.",

Typically, the generated ribonucleoprotein complexes rely on the binary interaction of defined RNA-sequences or precisely folded RNA-motifs with dedicated RNA-binding domains on the protein side. Here we describe a new molecular recognition principle of RNA-molecules by a high molecular mass protein complex. By chemically probing the solvent accessibility of mitochondrial pre-mRNAs when bound to the Trypanosoma brucei editosome we identified multiple similar but nonidentical RNA-motifs as editosome contact sites. However, by treating the different motifs as mathematical graph objects we demonstrate that they fit a consensus 2D-graph consisting of 4 vertices (V) and 3 edges (E) with a Laplacian eigenvalue of 0.523 ({lambda}2). We establish that a synthetic 4V(3E)-RNA is sufficient to compete for the editosomal pre-mRNA binding site and that it is able to inhibit RNA-editing in vitro. Our analysis corroborates that the editosome has adapted to the structural multiplicity of the mitochondrial mRNA-folding space by recognizing a fuzzy continuum of RNA-folds that fit a consensus graph-descriptor. This provides a mechanism on how the protein complex is able to bind the structurally pleomorphic pool of pre- and partially edited mRNAs.

The PANINI-MIBI approach was used to measure over 30 parameters simultaneously across large sections of archival lymphoid tissues from non-human primates that were healthy or infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a model that accurately recapitulates human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). This enabled multiplexed dissection of cellular phenotypes, functional markers, viral DNA integration events, and viral RNA transcripts as resulting from viral infection. The results demonstrated immune coordination from an unexpected upregulation of IL10 in B cells in response to SIV infection that correlated with macrophage M2 polarization, thus conditioning a potential immunosuppressive environment that allows for viral production. This multiplexed imaging strategy also allowed characterization of the coordinated microenvironment around latently or actively infected cells to provide mechanistic insights into the process of viral latency. The spatial multi-modal framework presented here is applicable to deciphering tissue responses in other infectious diseases and tumor biology.",

Here we describe novel monosynaptic long-range GABAergic projections from PFC to hippocampus. These preferentially inhibit vasoactive intestinal polypeptide expressing interneurons, which are known to disinhibit hippocampal microcircuits. Indeed, stimulating prefrontal-hippocampal GABAergic projections increases hippocampal feedforward inhibition and reduces hippocampal activity in vivo. The net effect of these actions is to specifically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for hippocampal representations of objects. Correspondingly, stimulation of PFC-to-hippocampus GABAergic projections promotes object exploration. Together, these results elucidate a novel top-down pathway in which long-range GABAergic projections target disinhibitory microcircuits, thereby enhancing signals and network dynamics underlying exploratory behavior.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric cancer with features of skeletal muscle; patients with unresectable or metastatic RMS fare poorly due to high rates of disease recurrence. Here, we use single cell and single nucleus RNA-sequencing to show that RMS tumors recapitulate the spectrum of embryonal myogenesis. Using matched patient samples from a clinical trial and orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (O-PDXs), we show chemotherapy eliminates the most proliferative component with features of myoblasts; after treatment, the quiescent immature population with features of paraxial mesoderm expands to reconstitute the developmental hierarchy of the original tumor. We discovered that this paraxial mesoderm population is dependent on EGFR signaling and is sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. Taken together, this data serves as a proof-of-concept that targeting each developmental state in RMS is an effective strategy for improving outcomes by preventing disease recurrence.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Withdrawal symptoms are observed upon cessation of cannabis use in humans. Although animal studies have examined withdrawal symptoms following exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), difficulties in obtaining objective measures of spontaneous withdrawal using paradigms that mimic cessation of use in humans have slowed research. The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) is known to be affected by chronic THC treatment and plays a role in many behaviors related to human THC withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include sleep disturbances that often drive relapse, and emotional behaviors, e.g., irritability and anhedonia. We examined THC withdrawal-induced changes in striatal DA release and the extent to which sleep disruption and behavioral maladaptation manifest during withdrawal in a mouse chronic cannabis exposure model. Using a THC treatment regimen known to produce tolerance we measured electrically elicited DA release in acute brain slices from different striatal subregions during early and late THC abstinence. Long-term polysomnographic recordings from mice were used to assess vigilance state and sleep architecture before, during, and after THC treatment. We additionally assessed how behaviors that model human withdrawal symptoms are altered by chronic THC treatment in early and late abstinence. We detected altered striatal DA release, sleep disturbances that mimic clinical observations, and behavioral maladaptation in mice following tolerance inducing THC treatment. Sex differences were observed in nearly all metrics. Altered striatal DA release, sleep and affect-related behaviors associated with spontaneous THC abstinence were more consistently observed in male mice. To our knowledge these findings provide the first model of directly translatable non-precipitated cannabis withdrawal symptoms, in particular, sleep disruption.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In most organisms, the maturation of nascent RNAs is coupled to transcription, undergoing many processing steps co-transcriptionally. Unlike in animals, the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes microRNAs (miRNAs) as long and structurally variable pri-miRNAs in plants. Current evidence suggests that the miRNA biogenesis complex assembly initiates early during the transcription of pri-miRNAs in plants. However, it is unknown whether miRNA processing occurs co-transcriptionally. Here, we show that plant miRNA biogenesis is coupled to transcription in a process that relies on the formation of DNA:RNA hybrids (R-loops) between the nascent transcript and the encoding loci. We used native elongating transcript sequencing data and imaging techniques to demonstrate that plant miRNA biogenesis occurs co-transcriptionally. We found that the entire biogenesis occurs coupled to transcription for pri-miRNAs processed from the loop but requires a second nucleoplasmic step for those processed from the base of the hairpin. Furthermore, we found that co- and post-transcriptional miRNA processing mechanisms co-exist for most miRNAs in a dynamic balance. Notably, we discovered that R-loops between the 5-end single-stranded arm of the pri-miRNAs and the encoding loci anchor the transcript, promoting co-transcriptional processing. Our data demonstrate the coupling of transcription and miRNA processing in plants and discovered an unexpected function for R-loops promoting RNA processing. Furthermore, our results suggest the neo-functionalization of co-transcriptionally processed miRNAs, boosting countless regulatory scenarios.",
