        "abstract": "BackgroundPolygenic risk scores (PRS) are linear combinations of genetic markers weighted by effect size that are commonly used to predict disease risk. For complex heritable diseases such as late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), PRS models fail to capture much of the heritability. Additionally, PRS models are highly dependent on the population structure of data on which effect sizes are assessed, and have poor generalizability to new data.\n\nObjectiveThe goal of this study is to construct a paragenic risk score that, in addition to single genetic marker data used in PRS, incorporates epistatic interaction features and machine learning methods to predict lifetime risk for LOAD.\n\nMethodsWe construct a new state-of-the-art genetic model for lifetime risk of Alzheimers disease. Our approach innovates over PRS models in two ways: First, by directly incorporating epistatic interactions between SNP loci using an evolutionary algorithm guided by shared pathway information; and second, by estimating risk via an ensemble of machine learning models (gradient boosting machines and deep learning) instead of simple logistic regression. We compare the paragenic model to a PRS model from the literature trained on the same dataset.\n\nResultsThe paragenic model is significantly more accurate than the PRS model under 10-fold cross-validation, obtaining an AUC of 83% and near-clinically significant matched sensitivity/specificity of 75%, and remains significantly more accurate when evaluated on an independent holdout dataset. Additionally, the paragenic model maintains accuracy within APOE genotypes.\n\nConclusionParagenic models show potential for improving lifetime disease risk prediction for complex heritable diseases such as LOAD over PRS models.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder and Alzheimers disease are two prevalent and devastating disorders that still lack effective treatment. Despite distinct disease phenotypes, these two disorders are characterized by similar neuroinflammatory processes. However, it is not clear to what extent these processes are shared. To compare pathways and their regulators affected in Alzheimers disease and depression, we adopted a systems biology approach. Consensus gene regulatory networks were built from RNA-seq data with GENIE3, CLR and Lemon-Tree. The two consensus networks were functionally characterized and compared to one another. Further, single-cell gene regulatory networks were constructed with SCENIC, to further characterize the regulatory programs active in specific cell types. In both disorders, aberrations in immune mechanisms and microglial activation were found, controlled by the same transcription factors (IKZF1, IRF8, NFATC2, RUNX1, SPI1, and TAL1). These transcription factors have been implicated in Alzheimers disease before, while only one has been associated with depression hitherto. Moreover, in Alzheimer, dysfunctions in mitochondria, the proteasome and myelination were discovered. In depression, astrocyte function, GABA receptor signaling, and transport across the blood-brain barrier were aberrated. These disrupted pathways and transcription factors should be further investigated and might be used to develop novel therapies for neuroinflammatory disorders.",

        "abstract": "ImportanceUndetected biological heterogeneity adversely impacts trials in Alzheimers disease because rate of cognitive decline -- and perhaps response to treatment -- differs in subgroups. Recent results show that data-driven approaches can unravel the heterogeneity of Alzheimers disease progression. The resulting stratification is yet to be leveraged in clinical trials.\n\nObjectiveInvestigate whether image-based data-driven disease progression modelling could identify baseline biological heterogeneity in a clinical trial, and whether these subgroups have prognostic or predictive value.\n\nDesignScreening data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer Disease (A4) Study collected between April 2014 and December 2017, and longitudinal data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) observational study downloaded in February 2022 were used.\n\nSettingThe A4 Study is an interventional trial involving 67 sites in the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan. ADNI is a multi-center observational study in North America.\n\nParticipantsCognitively unimpaired amyloid-positive participants with a 3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI scan. Amyloid positivity was determined using florbetapir PET imaging (in A4) and CSF A{beta}(1-42) (in ADNI).\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresRegional volumes estimated from MRI scans were used as input to the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm. Outcomes included cognitive test scores and SUVr values from florbetapir and flortaucipir PET.\n\nResultsWe included 1,240 A{beta}+ participants (and 407 A{beta}- controls) from the A4 Study, and 731 A4-eligible ADNI participants. SuStaIn identified three neurodegeneration subtypes -- Typical, Cortical, Subcortical -- comprising 523 (42%) individuals. The remainder are designated subtype zero (insufficient atrophy). Baseline PACC scores (A4 primary outcome) were significantly worse in the Cortical subtype (median = -1.27, IQR=[-3.34,0.83]) relative to both subtype zero (median=-0.013, IQR=[-1.85,1.67], P<.0001) and the Subcortical subtype (median=0.03, IQR=[-1.78,1.61], P=.0006). In ADNI, over a four-year period (comparable to A4), greater cognitive decline in the mPACC was observed in both the Typical (-0.23/yr; 95% CI, [-0.41,-0.05]; P=.01) and Cortical (-0.24/yr; [-0.42,-0.06]; P=.009) subtypes, as well as the CDR-SB (Typical: +0.09/yr, [0.06,0.12], P<.0001; and Cortical: +0.07/yr, [0.04,0.10], P<.0001).\n\nConclusions and RelevanceIn a large secondary prevention trial, our image-based model detected neurodegenerative heterogeneity predictive of cognitive heterogeneity. We argue that such a model is a valuable tool to be considered in future trial design to control for previously undetected variance.\n\nKey PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan MRI-based computational subtypes of preclinical neurodegeneration predict cognitive outcomes?\n\nFindingsIn this cross-sectional analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data at screening (pre-randomization) in the preclinical Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer disease (A4) Study, we detected considerable neurodegenerative heterogeneity using data-driven disease progression modelling. The MRI-based computational subtypes identified by Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) differed in baseline cognitive test scores (A4) and in longitudinal cognitive decline (ADNI), with sufficient heterogeneity to potentially obscure treatment effect in A4 trial outcomes.\n\nMeaningData-driven disease progression modelling of screening MRI scans can predict heterogeneity in cognitive performance/decline and potentially reduce heterogeneity in future clinical trials.",

Previous studies were restricted to specific cell types and pathways, precluding a comprehensive understanding of cellular crosstalk in AD. Here, we systematically characterized crosstalk interactions using single-nucleus transcriptional profiles from 67 clinically and neuropathologically well-characterized controls and AD brain donors. Crosstalk between microglia and neurons involved known AD risk genes as ligands or receptors. Reconstruction of the gene networks mediating this crosstalk revealed additional known AD risk genes perturbed in microglia. We identified a novel interaction between neuronal SEMA6D and a microglial regulatory sub-network involving TREM2 that is disrupted in AD and activated in the vicinity of A{beta} plaques and SEMA6D-expressing cells. Using CRISPR-modified human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, we demonstrated that SEMA6D activates microglia in a TREM2-dependent manner. Together, we show that characterizing cellular crosstalk networks yields new insights into AD biology.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Increasing evidence suggests that reactive astrocytes are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its underlying pathogenesis remains unknown. Given the role of astrocytes in energy metabolism, reactive astrocytes may contribute to altered energy metabolism. It is hypothesized that lactate, a glucose metabolite, is produced in astrocytes and subsequently shuttled to neurons as an energy substrate. This study aimed to examine alterations in brain lactate levels and their association with astrocytic activities in AD. Methods: 30 AD and 30 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects were enrolled. For AD subjects, amyloid and tau depositions were confirmed by positron emission tomography using [11C]PiB and [18F]florzolotau, respectively. Lactate and myo-inositol, an astroglial marker, in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were quantified by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). These MRS metabolites were compared with plasma biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as another astrocytic marker. Results: Lactate and myo-inositol levels were higher in AD than in CU (p < 0.05). Lactate levels correlated with myo-inositol levels (r = 0.272, p = 0.047). Lactate and myo-inositol levels were positively associated with the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes scores (p < 0.05). Significant correlations were noted between myo-inositol levels and plasma GFAP and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 levels (p < 0.05). Interpretation: We found high lactate levels accompanied by an increased astrocytic marker in the PCC in AD. Thus, impaired lactate shuttle of reactive astrocytes may disrupt energy regulation, resulting in surplus lactate levels. Myo-inositol and plasma GFAP may reflect similar astrocytic changes.",

Recent studies have revealed diverse AD-associated cell states, yet when and how they impact the causal chain leading to AD remains unknown. To reconstruct the dynamics of the brain's cellular environment along the disease cascade and to distinguish between AD and aging effects, we built a comprehensive cell atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex from 1.64 million single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles. We associated glial, vascular and neuronal subpopulations with AD-related traits for 424 aging individuals, and aligned them along the disease cascade using causal modeling. We identified two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations, one contributed to amyloid-{beta} proteinopathy while the other mediated the effect of amyloid-beta in accelerating tau proteinopathy, as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediated the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the coordinated dynamics of the entire cellular environment we devised the BEYOND methodology which uncovered two distinct trajectories of brain aging that are defined by distinct sequences of changes in cellular communities. Older individuals are engaged in one of two possible trajectories, each associated with progressive changes in specific cellular communities that end with: (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain aging. Thus, we provide a cellular foundation for a new perspective of AD pathophysiology that could inform the development of new therapeutic interventions targeting cellular communities, while designing a different clinical management for those individuals on the path to AD or to alternative brain aging.",

Amyloid precursor protein (App) knock-in mice recapitulate the human abeta pathology, allowing the elucidation of the downstream effects of abeta and their temporal appearance upon disease progression. Here we have investigated the sequential onset of AD-like pathologies in the AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse models by time-course transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus, a region severely affected in AD. Energy metabolism emerged as one of the most significantly altered pathways at an early stage of the development of the pathologies. Functional experiments in mitochondria isolated from AppNL-G-F brain subsequently identified upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation driven by the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and V, combined with higher susceptibility to Ca2+-overload. This was followed by a strong neuroinflammatory response and impaired autophagy. Accumulation of autophagosomes and reduced number of mitochondria content in presynaptic terminals could account for the altered synapse morphology including increased number of synaptic vesicles and lowered thickness of post synaptic density in AppNL-G-F mice. This shows that abeta-induced pathways in the App knock-in mice recapitulate some key pathologies observed in AD brain, and our data herein contributes to the understanding of their timewise appearance and potential role in new therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundAntipsychotic drugs have been associated with increased mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction in people with dementia. Concerns have been raised that antipsychotic prescribing may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the virus. We used multisource, routinely-collected healthcare data from Wales, UK, to investigate prescribing and mortality trends in people with dementia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethodsWe used individual-level, anonymised, population-scale linked health data to identify adults aged [&ge;]60 years with a diagnosis of dementia in Wales, UK. We explored antipsychotic prescribing trends over 67 months between 1st January 2016 and 1st August 2021, overall and stratified by age and dementia subtype. We used time series analyses to examine all-cause, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke mortality over the study period and identified the leading causes of death in people with dementia.\n\nFindingsOf 57,396 people with dementia, 11,929 (21%) were prescribed an antipsychotic at any point during follow-up. Accounting for seasonality, antipsychotic prescribing increased during the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. However, the absolute difference in prescribing rates was small, ranging from 1253 to 1305 per 10,000 person-months. Prescribing in the 60-64 age group and those with Alzheimers disease increased throughout the 5-year period. All-cause and stroke mortality increased in the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020 but MI mortality declined. From January 2020, COVID-19 was the second commonest underlying cause of death in people with dementia.\n\nInterpretationDuring the COVID-19 pandemic there was a small increase in antipsychotic prescribing in people with dementia. The long-term increase in antipsychotic prescribing in younger people and in those with Alzheimers disease warrants further investigation.\n\nFundingBritish Heart Foundation (BHF) (SP/19/3/34678) via the BHF Data Science Centre led by HDR UK, and the Scottish Neurological Research Fund.\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Ovid MEDLINE for studies describing antipsychotic prescribing trends in people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic, published between 1st January 2020 and 22nd March 2022. The following search terms were used: (exp Antipsychotic Agents/ OR antipsychotic.mp OR neuroleptic.mp OR risperidone.mp OR exp Risperidone/ OR quetiapine.mp OR exp Quetiapine Fumarate/ OR olanzapine.mp OR exp Olanzapine/ OR exp Psychotropic Drugs/ or psychotropic.mp) AND (exp Dementia/ OR exp Alzheimer Disease/ or alzheimer.mp) AND (prescri*.mp OR exp Prescriptions/ OR exp Electronic Prescribing/ OR trend*.mp OR time series.mp). The search identified 128 published studies, of which three were eligible for inclusion. Two studies, based on data from England and the USA, compared antipsychotic prescribing in people with dementia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both reported an increase in the proportion of patients prescribed an antipsychotic after the onset of the pandemic. A third study, based in the Netherlands, reported antipsychotic prescription trends in nursing home residents with dementia during the first four months of the pandemic, comparing prescribing rates to the timings of lifting of social restrictions, showing that antipsychotic prescribing rates remained constant throughout this period.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe conducted age-standardised time series analyses using comprehensive, linked, anonymised, individual-level routinely-collected, population-scale health data for the population of Wales, UK. By accounting for seasonal variations in prescribing and mortality, we demonstrated that the absolute increase in antipsychotic prescribing in people with dementia of any cause during the COVID-19 pandemic was small. In contrast, antipsychotic prescribing in the youngest age group (60-64 years) and in people with a subtype diagnosis of Alzheimers disease increased throughout the five-year study period. Accounting for seasonal variation, all-cause mortality rates in people with dementia began to increase in late 2019 and increased sharply during the first few months of the pandemic. COVID-19 became the leading non-dementia cause of death in people with dementia from 2020 to 2021. Stroke mortality increased during the pandemic, following a similar pattern to that of all-cause mortality, whereas myocardial infarction rates decreased.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceDuring COVID-19 we observed a large increase in all-cause and stroke mortality in people with dementia. When seasonal variations are accounted for, antipsychotic prescribing rates in all-cause dementia increased by a small amount before and during the pandemic in the UK. The increased prescribing rates in younger age groups and in people with Alzheimers disease warrants further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) characterizes time-varying fluctuations of functional brain network activity. While many studies have investigated static functional connectivity, it has been unclear whether features of dynamic functional connectivity are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Popular sliding-window and clustering methods for extracting dynamic RSFC have various limitations that prevent extracting reliable features to address this question. Here, we use a novel and robust time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) approach to extract the dynamic RSFC features from high resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of participants with Alzheimers disease (AD) and matched controls. The TVDN algorithm automatically and adaptively learns the low-dimensional spatiotemporal manifold of dynamic RSFC and detects dynamic state transitions in data. We show that amongst all the functional features we investigated, the dynamic manifold features are the most predictive of AD. These include: the temporal complexity of the brain network, given by the number of state transitions and their dwell times, and the spatial complexity of the brain network, given by the number of eigenmodes. These dynamic features have high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing AD from healthy subjects. Intriguingly, we found that AD patients generally have higher spatial complexity but lower temporal complexity compared with healthy controls. We also show that graph theoretic metrics of dynamic component of TVDN are significantly different in AD versus controls, while static graph metrics are not statistically different. These results indicate that dynamic RSFC features are impacted in neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimers disease, and may be crucial to understanding the pathophysiological trajectory of these diseases.",

We studied this variability by partitioning patients within the Alzheimers continuum into data-driven groups based on their regional T-N dissociation, which reflects the residuals after the effect of tau pathology is \"removed\". We found six groups displaying distinct spatial T-N mismatch and thickness patterns despite similar tau burden. Their T-N patterns resembled the neurodegeneration patterns of non-AD groups partitioned on the basis of z-scores of cortical thickness alone and were similarly associated with surrogates of non-AD factors. In an additional sample of individuals with antemortem imaging and autopsy, T-N mismatch was associated with TDP-43 co-pathology. Finally, T-N mismatch training was then applied to a separate cohort to determine the ability to classify individual patients within these groups. These findings suggest that T-N mismatch may provide a personalized approach for determining non-AD factors associated with resilience/vulnerability to Alzheimers disease.",

To address this, we performed single nucleus RNAseq on tissue from 32 AD and non-AD donors each with five cortical regions: entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, visual association cortex and primary visual cortex. Analysis of 51,586 endothelial cells revealed unique gene expression patterns across the five regions in non-AD donors. Alzheimers brain endothelial cells were characterized by upregulated protein folding genes and distinct transcriptomic differences in response to amyloid beta plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). This dataset demonstrates previously unrecognized regional heterogeneity in the endothelial cell transcriptome in both aged non-AD and AD brain.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this work, we show that vascular endothelial cells collected from five different brain regions display surprising variability in gene expression. In the presence of Alzheimers disease pathology, endothelial cell gene expression is dramatically altered with clear differences in regional and temporal changes. These findings help explain why certain brain regions appear to differ in susceptibility to disease-related vascular remodeling events that may impact blood flow.",

Individual SW events were sorted into high and low transition frequencies (TF) subtypes. We utilized time-frequency spectrogram locations within sleep EEG to \"map\" the precision of SW-TB and SW-SP neural circuit coupling in relation to amyloid positivity (by CSF A{beta}42/A{beta}40 threshold), cognitive impairment (by CDR), and CSF levels of AD-associated biomarkers.\n\nResultsCognitive impairment was associated with lower TB spectral power in both high and low TF SW-TB coupling (p<0.001, p=0.001). Cognitively unimpaired, amyloid positive aging adults demonstrated lower precision of the neural circuits propagating high TF SW-TB (p<0.05) and low TF SW-SP (p<0.005) event coupling, compared to cognitively unimpaired amyloid negative individuals.

However, the co-occurrence of amyloids of these proteins has also been reported in patients diagnosed with either disease. Here, we provide new evidence about the protein composition of aggregates formed when these two proteins are co-present. We show that soluble species of amyloid-{beta} can induce the aggregation of -synuclein. The amyloid fibrils formed under these conditions are solely composed of -synuclein to which amyloid-{beta} can be found associated, but not as part of the core of the fibrils.

We investigated the association between cancer history and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers for ADRD risk, using linear mixed-effects models to assess differences at the mean values of MRI markers and quantile regression to examine whether the association varies across the distribution of MRI markers of brain aging.\n\nMethodsAmong UK Biobank participants with [&ge;]1 brain MRI, we considered total gray matter volume, total brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, and mean cortical thickness in the Alzheimers disease (AD) signature region. Cancer history was ascertained from national registry and self-report. We first specified linear mixed models with random intercepts to assess mean differences in MRI markers according to cancer history. Next, to examine whether effects of cancer history on these markers varies across the ADRD risk distribution, we specified quantile regression models to assess differences in quantile cut-points of the distribution of MRI markers according to cancer history. Models adjusted for demographics, APOE-{varepsilon}4 status, and health behaviors.\n\nResultsThe sample included 42,242 MRIs on 37,588 participants with no cancer history (mean age 64.1 years), and 6,073 MRIs on 5,514 participants with a cancer diagnosis prior to MRI (mean age 66.7 years). Cancer history was associated with smaller mean hippocampal volume (b=-19 mm3, 95% confidence interval [CI]=-36, -1) and lower mean cortical thickness in the AD signature region (b=-0.004 mm, 95% CI=-0.007, -0.000).

Tau hyperphosphorylation affects its binding on the tubulin surface and has been shown to be involved in several pathologies such as Alzheimer disease. As the tau binding site on the microtubule lays close to the disordered and highly flexible tubulin C-terminal tails (CTTs), these are likely to impact the tau-tubulin interaction. Since the disordered tubulin CTTs are missing from the available experimental structures, we used homology modeling to build two complete models of tubulin heterotrimers with different isotypes for the {beta}-tubulin subunit ({beta}I/I/{beta}I and {beta}III/I/{beta}III). We then performed long timescale classical Molecular Dynamics simulations for the tauR2-tubulin assembly (in systems with and without CTTs) and analyzed the resulting trajectories to obtain a detailed view of the protein interface in the complex and the impact of the CTTs on the stability of this assembly. Additional analyses of the CTTs mobility in the presence, or in the absence, of tau also highlight how tau might modulate the CTTs activity as hooks that are involved in the recruitment of several MAPs.",

For the systematic review, we searched PubMed and Embase from their inception to August 23 2022, including cohort studies published in English that reported standard estimates of association and variance.\n\nData extraction and synthesisStudies were screened and results extracted independently by two authors. Study-specific estimates were aggregated using random-effect meta-analysis.

Incorporating the new results from the Finnish cohort study with those from the systematic review revealed that former boxers had higher rates of dementia (2 studies: summary risk ratio 3.14 [95% CI 1.72, 5.74], I2=34%) and Alzheimers disease (2 studies: 3.07 [1.01, 9.38], I2=55%), as did retired soccer players (3 studies of dementia: 2.78 [1.69, 4.59], I2=86%; 2 studies of Alzheimers disease: 3.22 [1.34, 7.75], I2=81%). While the pooled estimate for dementia in retired American football players was less convincing (4 studies: 1.63 [0.76, 3.49], I2 =75%), disease occurrence in onetime professionals was markedly higher (2.96 [1.66, 5.30]) than amateurs in whom there was no association (0.90 [0.52, 1.56]).

        "abstract": "Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are transient abnormal electrophysiological events commonly observed in epilepsy patients but are also present in other neurological disease, such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). Understanding the role IEDs have on the hippocampal circuit is important for our understanding of the cognitive deficits seen in epilepsy and AD. We characterize and compare the IEDs of human epilepsy patients from microwire hippocampal recording with those of AD transgenic mice with implanted multi-layer hippocampal silicon probes. Both the local field potential features and firing patterns of pyramidal cells and interneurons were similar in mouse and human. We found that as IEDs emerged from the CA3-1 circuits, they recruited pyramidal cells and silenced interneurons, followed by post-IED suppression. IEDs suppressed the incidence and altered the properties of physiological sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs), altered their physiological properties, and interfered with the replay of place field sequences in a maze. In addition, IEDs in AD mice inversely correlated with daily memory performance. Together, our work implicates that IEDs may present a common and epilepsy-independent phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases that perturbs hippocampal-cortical communication and interferes with memory.\n\nSignificant StatementPrevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and the number of people with dementia is increasing steadily. Therefore, novel treatment strategies for learning and memory disorders are urgently necessary. IEDs, apart from being a surrogate for epileptic brain regions, have also been linked to cognitive decline. Here we report that IEDs in human epilepsy patients and AD mouse models have similar local field potential characteristics and associated firing patterns of pyramidal cells and interneurons. Mice with more IEDs displayed fewer hippocampal SPW-Rs, poorer replay of spatial trajectories, and decreased memory performance. IED suppression is an unexplored target to treat cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "Multi-omic data spanning from genotype, gene expression to protein expression have been increasingly explored to interpret findings from genome wide association studies of Alzheimers disease (AD) and to gain more insight of the disease mechanism. However, each -omics data type is usually examined individually and the functional interactions between genetic variations, genes and proteins are only used after discovery to interpret the findings, but not beforehand. In this case, multi-omic findings are likely not functionally related and therefore give rise to challenges in interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a new interpretable deep neural network model MoFNet to jointly model the prior knowledge of functional interactions and multi-omic data set. It aims to identify a subnetwork of functional interactions predictive of AD evidenced by multi-omic measures. Particularly, prior functional interaction network was embedded into the architecture of MoFNet in a way that it resembles the information flow from DNA to gene and protein. The proposed model MoFNet significantly outperformed all other state-of-art classifiers when evaluated using multi-omic data from the ROS/MAP cohort. Instead of individual markers, MoFNet yielded multi-omic sub-networks related to innate immune system, clearance of misfolded proteins, and neurotransmitter release respectively. Around 50% of these findings were replicated in another independent cohort. Our identified gene/proteins are highly related to synaptic vesicle function. Altered regulation or expression of these genes/proteins could cause disruption in neuron-neuron or neuron-glia cross talk and further lead to neuronal and synapse loss in AD. Further investigation of these identified genes/proteins could possibly help decipher the mechanisms underlying synaptic dysfunction in AD, and ultimately inform therapeutic strategies to modify AD progression in the early stage.",

Real World Data (RWD) from electronic health records (EHRs) offer opportunities to accelerate precision drug development and scale epidemiological research on AD. A precise characterization of AD cohorts is needed to address the noise abundant in RWD.\n\nMETHODSWe conducted a retrospective cohort study to develop and test computational models for AD cohort identification using clinical data from 8 Massachusetts healthcare systems. We mined temporal representations from EHR data using a novel transitive sequential pattern mining algorithm (tSPM) to train and validate our models. We then tested our models against a held-out test set from a review of medical records to adjudicate the presence of AD. We trained two classes of models using Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to compare the utility of AD diagnosis records versus the tSPM temporal representations (comprising sequences of diagnosis and medication observations) from electronic medical records for characterizing AD cohorts.\n\nRESULTSIn a group of 4,985 patients, we identified 219 sequences of medication-diagnosis records for constructing the best classification models. The models with the sequential features improved AD classification by a magnitude of up to 16 percent (over the use of AD diagnosis codes). Six groups of sequences, which we refer to as temporal digital markers, were identified for characterizing the AD cohorts, including sequences that involved (1) a symptom or (2) a risk factor in the past, followed by an AD diagnosis, (3) AD medications, (4) indirect risk factors, symptom management, and potential side effects, (5) comorbidities with possible shared roots or side effects, and (6) plural encounters with of AD diagnosis codes. Discussions of how the identified sequential patterns can be interpreted are provided.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe present sequential patterns of diagnosis and medication codes from electronic medical records, as digital markers of Alzheimers Disease. Classification algorithms developed on the sequential patterns can replace standard features from EHRs to enrich phenotype modeling.",

Two thirds of Alzheimers disease patients are females and they have a higher disease risk. Moreover, women with Alzheimers disease have more extensive brain histological changes than men along with more severe cognitive symptoms and neurodegeneration. To identify how sex difference induces structural brain changes, we performed unbiased massively parallel single nucleus RNA sequencing on Alzheimers disease and control brains focusing on the middle temporal gyrus, a brain region strongly affected by the disease but not previously studied with these methods. We identified a subpopulation of selectively vulnerable layer 2/3 excitatory neurons that that were RORB-negative and CDH9-expressing. This vulnerability differs from that reported for other brain regions, but there was no detectable difference between male and female patterns in middle temporal gyrus samples. Disease-associated, but sex-independent, reactive astrocyte signatures were also present. In clear contrast, the microglia signatures of diseased brains differed between males and females. Combining single cell transcriptomic data with results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified MERTK genetic variation as a risk factor for Alzheimers disease selectively in females. Taken together, our single cell dataset revealed a unique cellular-level view of sex-specific transcriptional changes in Alzheimers disease, illuminating GWAS identification of sex-specific Alzheimers risk genes. These data serve as a rich resource for interrogation of the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimers disease.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, but the specific events that cause cell death remain poorly understood. Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE) is a recently discovered powerful cell death mechanism mediated by short (s) RNAs including micro (mi) RNAs acting through the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). G-rich 6mer seed sequences in the sRNAs (position 2-7) target hundreds of C-rich seed matches in genes essential for cell survival resulting in the simultaneous activation of multiple cell death pathways. Using Argonaute precipitation and RNAseq (Ago-RP-Seq) we analyzed RISC bound sRNAs (R-sRNAs) in in vitro models and in the brains of multiple in vivo AD mouse models, aged mice, and AD patients. In in vitro cell line studies we find evidence for a contribution of RNAi to the toxicity by toxic A{beta}42 oligomers. In addition, in AD mouse models with neurodegeneration, and in the aging brain R-sRNAs RISC bound sRNAs show a shift to more toxic seeds. In contrast, in cells that survived in post-mortem brains of AD patients and the brains of \"SuperAgers\", individuals over age 80 who have superior memory performance, R-sRNAs shift to more nontoxic seeds, supporting a protective function of miRNAs. Our data provide first evidence of a contribution of DISE to the neurotoxicity seen in AD suggesting that increasing the levels of protective miRNAs in the brain or blocking the activity of toxic R-sRNAs could lead to a novel way of treating the disease.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work explores a contribution of Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE), a powerful cell death mechanism based on RNA interference (RNAi) to the neurotoxicity seen in Alzheimers disease (AD) which has solely been attributed to toxic proteins (e.g., the amyloid precursor protein or phosphorylated Tau). We show a significant association between the occurrence of toxic short (s)RNAs bound to the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC, which mediates RNAi) and the neurotoxicity seen in various AD models and patients. In addition, toxic oligomeric fragments of APP induce toxicity in part by increasing RISC bound toxic sRNAs and require the RISC component Ago2. Our work offers an alternative view on the cause of the neurotoxicity seen in neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "Spontaneous activity during the resting state, tracked by BOLD fMRI imaging, or shortly rsfMRI, gives rise to brain-wide dynamic patterns of inter-regional correlations, whose structured flexibility relates to cognitive performance. Here we analyze resting state dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) in a cohort of older adults, including amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI, N = 34) and Alzheimers Disease (AD, N = 13) patients, as well as normal control (NC, N = 16) and cognitively \"super-normal\" (SN, N = 10) subjects. Using complementary state-based and state-free approaches, we find that resting state fluctuations of different functional links are not independent but are constrained by high-order correlations between triplets or quadruplets of functionally connected regions. When contrasting patients with healthy subjects, we find that dFC between cingulate and other limbic regions is increasingly bursty and intermittent when ranking the four groups from SNC to NC, aMCI and AD. Furthermore, regions affected at early stages of AD pathology are less involved in higher-order interactions in patient than in control groups, while pairwise interactions are not significantly reduced. Our analyses thus suggest that the spatiotemporal complexity of dFC organization is precociously degraded in AD and provides a richer window into the underlying neurobiology than time-averaged FC connections.\n\nAuthor SummaryBrain functions emerge from the coordinated dynamics of many brain regions. Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) analyses are a key tool to describe such dynamic complexity, and have been shown to be good predictors of cognitive performance. This is particularly true in the case of Alzheimers Disease (AD) in which an impoverished dFC could indicate compromised functional reserve due to the detrimental effects of neurodegeneration. Here we observe that in healthy ageing dFC is indeed spatiotemporally organized, as reflected by high-order correlations between multiple regions. However, in people with aMCI or AD, dFC becomes less \"entangled\", more random-like, and intermittently bursty. We speculate that this degraded spatiotemporal coordination may reflect dysfunctional information processing, thus ultimately leading to worsening of cognitive deficits.",

Increased WMH burden results in increased cognitive decline and progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, research has been inconsistent when examining whether sex differences influence the relationship between vascular risk factors, WMH accumulation, and cognition.\n\nMethodsA total of 2119 participants (987 females) with 9847 follow-ups from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative met inclusion criteria for this study. Linear regressions were used to examine the association between vascular risk factors (individually and as a composite score) and WMH burden in males and females. When controlling for vascular risk factors, linear mixed models were also used to investigate whether the relationship between WMHs and longitudinal cognitive scores differed between males and females.\n\nResultsMales had overall increased occipital (p<.001), but lower frontal (p<.001), total (p=.01), and deep (p<.001) WMH burden compared to females. For males, history of hypertension was the strongest contributor to WMH burden. On the other hand, the vascular composite score was the strongest factor for WMH in females. Greater increase in WMH accumulation was observed in males with a history of hypertension in the frontal region (p=.014) and males with high systolic blood pressure in the occipital region (p=.029) compared to females. With respect to cognition, WMH burden was more strongly associated with longitudinal decreases in global cognition, executive functioning, and functional activities of daily living in females compared to males.\n\nDiscussionThese findings show that controlling hypertension is important to reduce WMH burden in males. Conversely, minimizing WMH burden through vascular risk factors requires controlling many factors for females (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol abuse, etc.). The results have implications for therapies and interventions designed to target cerebrovascular pathology and the subsequent cognitive decline.",

There is significant variation in age at onset and severity of symptoms highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyzed cell and pathology composition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains using the semi-automated workflow (QUINT); which we expanded to allow for nonlinear refinement of brain atlas-registration, and quality control assessment of atlas-registration and brain section integrity. Near global age-related increases in microglia, astrocyte, and amyloid-beta accumulation were measured, while regional variation in neuron load existed among strains. Furthermore, hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses were combined with bulk RNA- sequencing results to demonstrate the relationship between cell composition and gene expression. Overall, the additional functionality of the QUINT workflow delivers a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models.",

New candidate genes were identified and numerous genes already implicated in AD pathogenesis were confirmed. We show that multi-omics of leukocytes can define AD candidate genes and we strengthen the role of LOY in disease development. The LOY-associated differences in DNA methylation levels were predominantly observed in regulatory regions, and supported by expression analysis showing down-regulation of immune genes. The single-cell transcriptomics highlighted that the AD patient-specific immune activation dominates over LOY-specific activation.

The exosomes in olfactory fluid are useful neurodegenerative biomarkers for the rich contents of neural biomarkers. They are also readily accessible to collect in ample amount noninvasively suggesting as a primary biomarker candidate as long as the validity of precise pathophysiological information is assured. In this study, we collected nasal lavage fluid (NLF) from 5XFAD mice from where intact exosomes are separated via microfluidic system in a high efficacy. To investigate the functional effect of the collected exosomes, they were applied to the primary cortical neurons and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC). The neuronal activities were recorded with a high density microelectrode array system allowing observation of overall neuronal spikes and local field potential (LFP) properties. Interestingly, 5XFAD NLF exosomes increased the firing rate of neuronal spikes with augmentation of neuronal connectivity similar to the effect of pathological amyloid beta oligomer treatment. Additionally, LFP recordings in OHSC incubated with the exosomes revealed elevated local activity that was confirmed with current source density analysis. The results demonstrate that exosomes in 5XFAD NLF can effectively modify neuronal networks, which suggests it may serve as a functional biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.",

Since epileptogenesis is associated with changes in excitatory: inhibitory (E:I) balance, we examined postmortem AD brain tissue from patients with and without seizure history and five times familial AD (5XFAD) mice for changes in several markers of E:I balance, including the inhibitory GABAA receptor, the chloride cotransporters, sodium potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), and the excitatory NMDA and AMPA type glutamate receptors. We hypothesized that seizure history in AD patients would be associated with greater E:I imbalances, and that such changes would also be observed in the 5XFAD mice following pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. We found that seizures in AD patients were associated with alterations in NKCC1 and KCC2 expression, indicative of depolarizing GABA, and exacerbated cognitive deficits. Seizures also significantly contributed to E:I imbalance in the 5XFAD mouse model, as similar changes in NKCC1 and KCC2 expression were found in PTZ treated 5XFAD mice, along with altered AMPA receptor protein expression indicative of calcium permeable-AMPA receptors. In addition, we found that chronic treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin at doses we have previously shown to attenuate seizure-induced {beta}-amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits in 5XFAD mice, can mitigate the dysregulation of markers of E:I balance in this model. These data suggest that mTOR activation plays a role in modifying the E:I imbalance and network hyperexcitability in AD and that the FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin may have potential for therapy in AD patients with a seizure history.",

To interrogate the role(s) of SORL1 in human brain cells, SORL1 null iPSCs were generated, followed by differentiation to neuron, astrocyte, microglia, and endothelial cell fates. Loss of SORL1 led to alterations in both overlapping and distinct pathways across cell types, with the greatest effects in neurons and astrocytes. Intriguingly, SORL1 loss led to a dramatic neuron-specific reduction in APOE levels. Further, analyses of iPSCs derived from a human aging cohort revealed a neuron-specific linear correlation between SORL1 and APOE RNA and protein levels, a finding validated in human post-mortem brain. Pathway analysis implicated intracellular transport pathways and TGF- {beta}/SMAD signaling in the function of SORL1 in neurons. In accord, enhancement of retromer-mediated trafficking and autophagy rescued elevated phospho-tau observed in SORL1 null neurons but did not rescue APOE levels, suggesting that these phenotypes are separable. Stimulation and inhibition of SMAD signaling modulated APOE RNA levels in a SORL1-dependent manner.

In certain overexpression models of Alzheimers Disease (AD), pharmacology and genetics demonstrate its essential role for synaptic plasticity impairment, memory deficits and synapse loss. However, PrPCs role in AD-related phenotypes with endogenous expression levels, its role in tau accumulation and its effect on imaging biomarkers are unknown. The necessity of PrPC for transcriptomic alterations driven by A{beta} across cell types is unexplored.\n\nMethodsThe role of PrPC was examined as a function of age in homozygous AppNL-G-F/hMapt double knock-in mice (DKI). Phenotypes of AppNL-G-F/hMapt mice with a deletion of Prnp expression (DKI; Prnp-/-) were compared with DKI mice with intact Prnp, mice with a targeted deletion of Prnp (Prnp-/-), and mice with intact Prnp (WT). Phenotypes examined included behavioral deficits, synapse loss by PET imaging, synapse loss by immunohistology, tau pathology, gliosis, inflammatory markers, and snRNA-seq transcriptomic profiling.\n\nResultsBy 9 months age, DKI mice showed learning and memory impairment, but DKI; Prnp-/- and Prnp-/- groups were indistinguishable from WT. Synapse loss in DKI brain, measured by [18F]SynVesT-1 SV2A PET or anti-SV2A immunohistology, was prevented by Prnp deletion. Accumulation of Tau phosphorylated at aa 217 and 202/205, C1q tagging of synapses, and dystrophic neurites were all increased in DKI mice but each decreased to WT levels with Prnp deletion. In contrast, astrogliosis, microgliosis and A{beta} levels were unchanged between DKI and DKI; Prnp-/- groups. Single-nuclei transcriptomics revealed differential expression in neurons and glia of DKI mice relative to WT. For DKI; Prnp-/- mice, the majority of neuronal genes differentially expressed in DKI mice were no longer significantly altered relative to WT, but most glial DKI-dependent gene expression changes persisted. The DKI-dependent neuronal genes corrected by Prnp deletion associated bioinformatically with synaptic function. Additional genes were uniquely altered only in the Prnp-/-or the DKI; Prnp-/- groups.\n\nConclusionsA functional Prnp gene is required in AppNL-G-F/hMapt double knock-in mice for synapse loss, phospho-tau accumulation and neuronal gene expression. These data support the efficacy of targeting the A{beta}o-PrPC interaction to prevent A{beta}o-neurotoxicity and pathologic tau accumulation in AD.",

Rare variants in SORL1 have been associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) and rare pathogenic variants are estimated to occur in up to 2.75% of early onset AD patients and in 1.5% of unrelated late onset AD patients. While truncation mutations are observed almost exclusively in AD patients, it is currently unknown which among the hundreds of rare missense variants identified in SORL1, are pathogenic. Here we address this question by relying on SORLAs distinct molecular architecture. First, we completed a structure-guided sequence alignment for all the protein domains. Next, we identified proteins that contain domains homologous to those of SORLA, which include pathogenic variants for monogenic diseases. We identified the analogous domain positions of these variants in the SORLA protein sequence and showed that variants in these positions similarly impair SORL1, and lead to AD. Together, our findings represent a comprehensive compendium on SORLA protein variation and functional effects, which allowed us to prioritize SORL1 genetic variants into high or moderate priority mutations. We envision that this compendium will be used by clinical geneticists for assessing variants they identify in patients, allowing further development of diagnostic procedures and patient counseling strategies. Utimately, this compendium will inform investigations into the molecular mechanisms of endosomal recycling which will support the development of therapeutic treatment strategies for SORL1 variant-carrying patients.",

The proposed model offers several improvements over the existing joint independent component analysis (jICA) model. We assume a shared mixing matrix for both the sMRI and fMRI modalities, while allowing for different mixing matrices linking the sMRI data to the different ICNs. We introduce the model and then apply this approach to study the differences in resting fMRI and sMRI data from patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) versus controls. The results yield significant differences with large effect sizes that include regions in overlapping portions of default mode network, and also hippocampus and thalamus. Importantly, we identify two joint components with partially overlapping regions which show opposite effects for Alzheimers disease versus controls, but were able to be separated due to being linked to distinct functional and structural patterns. This highlights the unique strength of our approach and multimodal fusion approaches generally in revealing potentially biomarkers of brain disorders that would likely be missed by a unimodal approach. These results represent the first work linking multiple fMRI ICNs to gray matter components within a multimodal data fusion model and challenges the typical view that brain structure is more sensitive to AD than fMRI.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundCausal feature selection is essential for estimating effects from observational data. Identifying confounders is a crucial step in this process. Traditionally, researchers employ content-matter expertise and literature review to identify confounders. Uncontrolled confounding from unidentified confounders threatens validity, conditioning on intermediate variables (mediators) weakens estimates, and conditioning on common effects (colliders) induces bias. Additionally, without special treatment, erroneous conditioning on variables combining roles introduces bias. However, the vast literature is growing exponentially, making it infeasible to assimilate this knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel knowledge graph (KG) application enabling causal feature selection by combining computable literature-derived knowledge with biomedical ontologies. We present a use case of our approach specifying a causal model for estimating the total causal effect of depression on the risk of developing Alzheimers disease (AD) from observational data.\n\nMethodsWe extracted computable knowledge from a literature corpus using three machine reading systems and inferred missing knowledge using logical closure operations. Using a KG framework, we mapped the output to target terminologies and combined it with ontology-grounded resources. We translated epidemiological definitions of confounder, collider, and mediator into queries for searching the KG and summarized the roles played by the identified variables. We compared the results with output from a complementary method and published observational studies and examined a selection of confounding and combined role variables in-depth.\n\nResultsOur search identified 128 confounders, including 58 phenotypes, 47 drugs, 35 genes, 23 collider, and 16 mediator phenotypes. However, only 31 of the 58 confounder phenotypes were found to behave exclusively as confounders, while the remaining 27 phenotypes played other roles. Obstructive sleep apnea emerged as a potential novel confounder for depression and AD.

        "abstract": "White matter (WM) alterations are commonly found across different stages of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the association between these changes with underlying AD pathology such as amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau deposition is still poorly understood. Hitherto, most studies have assessed WM alterations in AD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nonetheless, DTI has methodological shortcomings that limit an accurate biological interpretation. To address this limitation, here we applied fixel-based analysis (FBA) to disentangle microscopic differences in fiber density (FD) from macroscopic morphological changes in fiber cross-section (FC) in early stages of AD. We further investigated the associations of FBA metrics with AD pathology and cognitive performance. Additionally, we compared FBA results with other commonly used WM metrics derived from DTI, free-water corrected (FW)-DTI and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). To achieve these goals, we included 224 A{beta}-negative and 91 A{beta}-positive cognitively unimpaired individuals as well as 78 A{beta}-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), A{beta}-PET and tau-PET scans from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. We found that tau-PET uptake in medial temporal regions was associated with macrostructural alterations reflected by reduced FC mainly in the parahippocampal part of the cingulum bundle in A{beta}-positive individuals. This tau-related WM alteration was also associated with impaired memory. Interestingly, only FBA metrics were able to capture the association between tau-PET uptake and white matter degeneration. No association was found between global amyloid load and any dMRI metrics. Compared to both cognitively unimpaired groups, MCI patients showed a decrease in all FBA metrics in the entire cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiations. Metrics derived from DKI, and FW-DTI revealed a similar pattern of alterations whereas the spatial extent of WM abnormalities detected by DTI was more widespread. Altogether, our results indicate that early WM alterations in AD are mainly due to macrostructural changes identified by FBA metrics, being more closely associated with tau than A{beta} pathology. These findings suggest that future studies assessing the effects of AD pathology in white matter tracts should consider using FBA metrics.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of {beta}-amyloid peptide (A{beta}). There is increasing evidence that depression may precede AD and may be an early manifestation of dementia, suggesting common mechanisms underlying both diseases. Ligands targeting the mitochondrial translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), promote neurosteroidogenesis and may be neuroprotective. Moreover, TSPO is upregulated in AD. To study whether the TSPO ligand XBD173 may exert early neuroprotective effects in AD pathology we investigated the impact of XBD173 on amyloid toxicity and neuroplasticity in mouse models. We show that XBD173 (emapunil), via neurosteroid-mediated signaling via delta subunit-containing GABAA receptors, prevents the neurotoxic effect of A{beta} on long-term potentiation (CA1-LTP) in the hippocampus and prevents the loss of spines. Chronic but not acute administration of XBD173 ameliorates spatial learning deficits in transgenic AD mice with arctic mutation (ArcA{beta}) mice. The heterozygous TSPO-knockout crossed with the transgenic arctic mutation model of AD mice (het TSPOKO X ArcA{beta}) treated with XBD173 does not show this improvement in spatial learning suggesting TSPO is needed for procognitive effects of XBD173. The neuroprotective profile of XBD173 in AD pathology is further supported by a reduction in plaques and soluble A{beta} levels in the cortex, increased synthesis of neurosteroids, rescued spine density, reduction of complement protein C1q deposits, and reduced astrocytic phagocytosis of functional synapses both in the hippocampus and cortex. Our findings suggest that XBD173 may exert therapeutic effects via TSPO in a mouse model of AD.",

Notably, proteomic analysis of the graft enabled the identification of proteomic alterations in AD patient brain cells, associated with increased levels of {beta}-sheet structures and A{beta}42 peptides.

Generativity is associated with purpose in life, with both being shown to independently improve cognition in older adults. Our aims were to identify the neural substrates supporting generativity and determine the mechanism underlying the relationship between generativity and purpose in life in older adults.\n\nMethodForty-three older adults (Mage = 70.33, 79.1% female) at risk for Alzheimers disease underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and completed questionnaires assessing generativity, social support, and purpose in life. Seed-to-voxel analyses examined if resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum, key nodes at the intersection of subjective valuation and self-transcendence, were associated with generativity. Moderated mediation models examined if social support or rsFC mediated or moderated the association between generativity and purpose in life, respectively.\n\nResultsGenerative desire was associated with enhanced rsFC between the vmPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC). Affectionate social support fully mediated the relationship between generative desire and purpose in life, and rsFC between the vmPFC and rdlPFC significantly moderated this association.\n\nDiscussionThis study is the first to examine the rsFC underlying generativity and provides mechanistic insight into how purpose in life is enhanced through generative desire. Generative desire is supported by rsFC implicated in value-based social decision making and is associated with purpose in life through enhanced love and affection from others.

We recently showed that the innate immune response in the form of monocyte activation is detectable at the pre-clinical stage.\n\nObjectivesOur goal here is to characterize changes of gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes from patients at different stages of AD progression and validate potential biomarkers for a better prognosis and diagnosis of AD clinical spectrum.\n\nResultsWe performed a whole transcriptome analysis on monocytes purified from healthy subjects, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD patients, and established the list of genes differentially expressed in monocytes during the disease evolution. We observed that, in the top 500 genes differentially expressed, a majority of these genes were upregulated (65%) during AD progression. These genes are mainly involved in chemokine/cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. We further confirmed several biomarkers by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting and showed that they are often deregulated at pre-clinical stages of the disease (MCI stage), supporting the hyperactivation of monocytes in MCI patients.\n\nPerspectivesOur findings provide evidence that the pre-clinical stage of AD can be detected in monocytes using a specific set of biomarkers, highlighting the importance to study the early innate immune response in AD.

        "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic and experimental evidence strongly implicates myeloid cells in the etiology of AD and suggests that AD-associated alleles and genes may modulate disease risk by altering the transcriptional and cellular responses of macrophages (like microglia) to damage of lipid-rich tissues (like the brain). Specifically, recent single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/nRNA-seq) studies identified a transcriptionally distinct state of subsets of macrophages in aging or degenerating brains (usually referred to as disease- associated microglia or DAM) and in other diseased lipid-rich tissues (e.g., obese adipose tissue, fatty liver, and atherosclerotic plaques). We collectively refer to these subpopulations as lipid-associated macrophages or LAMs. Importantly, this particular activation state is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in the phagocytic clearance of lipid-rich cellular debris (efferocytosis), including several AD risk genes.\n\nMethodsWe used sc/nRNA-seq data from human and mouse microglia from healthy and diseased brains and macrophages from other lipid-rich tissues to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and identify transcriptional regulators whose regulons are enriched for LAM response genes (LAM TFs) across species. We then used gene knock- down/knock-out strategies to validate some of these LAM TFs in human THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia in vitro, as well as mouse microglia in vivo.\n\nResultsWe nominate 11 strong candidate LAM TFs shared across human and mouse networks (BHLHE41, HIF1A, ID2, JUNB, MAF, MAFB, MEF2A, MEF2C, NACA, POU2F2 and SPI1). We also demonstrate a strong enrichment of AD risk alleles in the cistrome of BHLHE41 (and its close homolog BHLHE40), thus implicating its regulon in the modulation of disease susceptibility. Loss or reduction of BHLHE40/41 expression in human THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia, as well as loss of Bhlhe40/41 in mouse microglia led to increased expression of LAM response genes, specifically those involved in cholesterol clearance and lysosomal processing, with a concomitant increase in cholesterol efflux and storage, as well as lysosomal mass and degradative capacity.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, this study nominates transcriptional regulators of the LAM response, experimentally validates BHLHE40/41 in human and mouse macrophages/microglia, and provides novel targets for therapeutic modulation of macrophage/microglia function in AD and other disorders of lipid-rich tissues.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/528372v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f356forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17d259forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1312809org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3b6a8f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Hence, this study was to explore the effects of cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) on the expression of IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, pAkt (Ser473), and GLUT3 in the sporadic AD rat model. The rats were induced to develop sporadic AD by intraperitoneal administration of Scopolamine. The downregulation expression of IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, pAkt (Ser473) and GLUT3 may lead to impaired insulin signaling which is associated with the development of AD. All these data were compared to Saline-treated control rats. However, cholecalciferol treatment in AD rats may improve memory performance by increasing the expression of insulin signaling proteins and hence ameliorates impaired insulin signaling.

        "abstract": "1.0.Electrical stimulation has had a profound impact on our current understanding of nervous system physiology and provided viable clinical options for addressing neurological dysfunction within the brain. Unfortunately, the brains immune suppression of indwelling microelectrodes currently presents a major roadblock in the long-term application of neural recording and stimulating devices. In some ways, brain trauma induced by penetrating microelectrodes produces similar neuropathology as debilitating brain diseases, such as Alzheimers disease (AD), while also suffering from end-stage neuron loss and tissue degeneration. To understand whether there may be any parallel mechanisms at play between brain injury from chronic microelectrode implantation and those of neurodegenerative disorder, we used two-photon microscopy to visualize the accumulation, if any, of age- and disease-associated factors around chronically implanted electrodes in both young and aged mouse models of AD. With this approach, we determined that electrode injury leads to aberrant accumulation of lipofuscin, an age-related pigment, in wild-type and AD mice alike. Furthermore, we reveal that chronic microelectrode implantation reduces the growth of pre-existing amyloid plaques while simultaneously elevating amyloid burden at the electrode-tissue interface. Lastly, we uncover novel spatial and temporal patterns of glial reactivity, axonal and myelin pathology, and neurodegeneration related to neurodegenerative disease around chronically implanted microelectrodes. This study offers multiple novel perspectives on the possible neurodegenerative mechanisms afflicting chronic brain implants, spurring new potential avenues of neuroscience investigation and design of more targeted therapies for improving neural device biocompatibility and treatment of degenerative brain disease.",

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of cortical tau quantified by positron emission tomography (PET) was performed.\n\nMethodParticipants included 3,136 non-Hispanic White older adults from 12 independent studies (n=1,449 discovery sample; n=1,687 replication sample) spanning preclinical and clinical stages of AD. Genetic variants associated with cortical tau measured using [18F]flortaucipir or [18F]MK-6240 PET were assessed including relevant covariates. Voxel-wise analysis was used to map the topographic distribution of identified associations. Supporting evidence for the identified SNP from gene expression, methylation quantitative trait loci (QTL), and AD mouse data were evaluated.\n\nFindingsTwo novel SNPs at the CYP1B1-RMDN2 (Cytochrome P450 Family 1 Subfamily B Member 1 and Regulator of Microtubule Dynamics 2) locus were associated with tau deposition. The most significant signal was at rs2113389 (p-value=1.37x10-8), which explained 4.3% of the variation in cortical tau, while APOE4 rs429358 accounted for 3.6%. The minor allele of rs2113389 (T; MAF=0.146) was associated with higher tau and faster cognitive decline. Additive effects, but no interactions, were observed between rs2113389 and diagnosis, APOE4, and A{beta} positivity. Voxel-wise analysis revealed higher tau in AD-related regions in rs2113389 T-allele carriers. CYP1B1 was upregulated in the temporal cortex in AD. The rs2113389 T-allele was associated with higher temporal cortex CYP1B1 expression and methylation levels. Mouse model studies provided additional functional evidence for a relationship between CYP1B1 and tau deposition but not A{beta}.\n\nInterpretationThe minor allele of rs2113389 may be a risk variant for tau and faster cognitive decline in AD. Further investigation of CYP1B1 and RMDN2 is warranted and may provide insight into the genetic basis of cerebral tau and novel pathways for therapeutic development in AD.

        "abstract": "High levels of plasma cholesterol, especially high levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), have been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimers disease. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in plasma distributes cholesteryl esters between lipoproteins and increases LDL-C in plasma. Epidemiologically, decreased CETP activity has been associated with sustained cognitive performance during aging, longevity, and a lower risk of Alzheimers disease. Thus, pharmacological CETP inhibitors could potentially be repurposed for the treatment of Alzheimers disease as they are safe and effective at lowering CETP activity and LDL-C. While CETP is mostly expressed by the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, CETP is also expressed by astrocytes in the brain. It is therefore important to determine if CETP inhibitors can enter the brain. Here, we describe pharmacokinetic parameters of the CETP inhibitor evacetrapib in plasma, liver, and brain tissues in CETP transgenic mice. We show that evacetrapib crosses the blood-brain barrier and is detectable in brain tissue 0.5 h after a 40 mg/kg i.v. injection in a nonlinear function. We conclude that evacetrapib may prove to be a good candidate to treat CETP-mediated cholesterol dysregulation in Alzheimers disease.",

It is not well understood how MCIA facilitates the assembly of CI. Here we report the structural basis of the complex formation between the MCIA subunits ECSIT and ACAD9. ECSIT binding induces a major conformational change in the FAD-binding loop of ACAD9, resulting in efflux of the FAD cofactor and redeployment of ACAD9 from fatty acid {beta}-oxidation (FAO) to CI assembly. We identify an adjacent -helix as a key structural element that specifically enables the CI assembly functionality of ACAD9, distinguishing it from its closely related VLCAD counterpart. Furthermore, we show that ECSIT is phosphorylated in vitro and ex cellulo and provide evidence that phosphorylation downregulates its association with ACAD9. Interestingly, ECSIT has previously been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease and here we show that ECSIT phosphorylation in neuronal cells is reduced upon exposure to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) oligomers.\n\nThese findings shed light on the assembly of the MCIA complex and implicate ECSIT as a potential reprogrammer of bioenergetic metabolic pathways that can be altered when mitochondria are affected by A{beta} toxicity, a hallmark of Alzheimers disease.",

Here, we investigate how well A{beta}+ can be predicted from T1 weighted brain MRI and gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid segmentations from T1-weighted brain MRI (T1w), a less invasive alternative. We used 3D convolutional neural networks to predict A{beta}+ based on 3D brain MRI data, from 762 elderly subjects (mean age: 75.1 yrs. {+/-}7.6SD; 394F/368M; 459 healthy controls, 67 with MCI and 236 with dementia) scanned as part of the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We also tested whether the accuracy increases when using transfer learning from the larger UK Biobank dataset. Overall, the 3D CNN predicted A{beta}+ with 76% balanced accuracy from T1w scans. The closest performance to this was using white matter maps alone when the model was pre-trained on an age prediction in the UK Biobank. The performance of individual tissue maps was less than the T1w, but transfer learning helped increase the accuracy. Although tests on more diverse data are warranted, deep learned models from standard MRI show initial promise for A{beta}+ estimation, before considering more invasive procedures.\n\nClinical RelevanceEarly detection of A{beta} positivity from less invasive MRI images, could offer a screening test prior to more invasive testing procedures.",

        "abstract": "Brain signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) often show oscillations at various frequencies, which are represented as distinct \"bumps\" in the power spectral density (PSD) of these signals. In addition, the PSD also shows a distinct reduction in power with increasing frequency, which pertains to aperiodic activity and is often termed as the \"1/f\" component. While a change in periodic activity in brain signals with healthy aging and mental disorders has been reported, recent studies have shown a reduction in the slope of the aperiodic activity with these factors as well. However, these studies only analysed PSD slopes over a limited frequency range (<100 Hz). To test whether the PSD slope is affected over a wider frequency range with aging and mental disorder, we collected EEG data with high sampling rate (2500 Hz) from a large population of elderly subjects (>49 years) who were healthy (N=217) or had mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N=11) or Alzheimers Disease (AD; N=5), and analysed the PSD slope till 800 Hz. Consistent with previous studies, the 1/f slope up to ~150 Hz reduced with healthy aging. Surprisingly, we found the opposite at higher frequencies (>200 Hz): the slope increased with age. This result was observed in all electrodes, for both eyes open and eyes closed conditions, and for different reference schemes. Slopes were not significantly different in MCI/AD subjects compared to age and gender matched healthy controls. Overall, our results constrain the biophysical mechanisms that are reflected in the PSD slopes in healthy and pathological aging.\n\nSignificance StatementAperiodic activity in the brain is characterized by measuring the slope of the power spectrum of brain signals. This slope has been shown to flatten with healthy aging, suggesting an increase in some sort of \"neural noise\". However, this flattening has been observed only over a limited frequency range (<150 Hz). We found that at higher frequencies (>200 Hz), the opposite happens: the slope steepens with age. This occurs at all electrodes, irrespective of state and referencing techniques. However, the slope is unchanged in subjects with early Alzheimers Disease (AD) and their controls. Our results shed new light on the properties of neural noise and the neurophysiological processes affecting AD and the aperiodic activity.",

        "abstract": "Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are hetero-bifunctional molecules. They induce the degradation of a target protein by recruiting an E3 ligase to the target. The PROTAC can inactivate disease-related genes that are considered as understudied, thus has a great potential to be a new type of therapy for the treatment of incurable diseases. However, only hundreds of proteins have been experimentally tested if they are amenable to the PROTACs. It remains elusive what other proteins can be targeted by the PROTAC in the entire human genome. For the first time, we have developed an interpretable machine learning model PrePROTAC, which is based on a transformer-based protein sequence descriptor and random forest classification to predict genome-wide PROTAC-induced targets degradable by CRBN, one of the E3 ligases. In the benchmark studies, PrePROTAC achieved ROC-AUC of 0.81, PR-AUC of 0.84, and over 40% sensitivity at a false positive rate of 0.05, respectively. Furthermore, we developed an embedding SHapley Additive exPlanations (eSHAP) method to identify positions in the protein structure, which play key roles in the PROTAC activity. The key residues identified were consistent with our existing knowledge. We applied PrePROTAC to identify more than 600 novel understudied proteins that are potentially degradable by CRBN, and proposed PROTAC compounds for three novel drug targets associated with Alzheimers disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryMany human diseases remain incurable because disease-causing genes cannot by selectively and effectively targeted by small molecules. Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), an organic compound that binds to both a target and a degradation-mediating E3 ligase, has emerged as a promising approach to selectively target disease-driving genes that are not druggable by small molecules. Nevertheless, not all of proteins can be accommodated by E3 ligases, and be effectively degraded. Knowledge on the degradability of a protein will be crucial for the design of PROTACs. However, only hundreds of proteins have been experimentally tested if they are amenable to the PROTACs. It remains elusive what other proteins can be targeted by the PROTAC in the entire human genome. In this paper, we propose an intepretable machine learning model PrePROTAC that takes advantage of powerful protein language modeling. PrePROTAC achieves high accuracy when evaluated by an external dataset which comes from different gene families from the proteins in the training data, suggesting the generalizability of PrePROTAC. We apply PrePROTAC to the human genome, and identify more than 600 understudied proteins that are potentially responsive to the PROTAC. Furthermore, we design three PROTAC compounds for novel drug targets associated with Alzheimers disease.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundHuman apolipoprotein (APO)-E4 has been related to neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimers disease and cognitive decline. Reelin and Clusterin share the VLDLR and ApoER2 receptors with APOE4. Here we checked the role of these components in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-induced cognitive decline.\n\nMethodsThis is a cross-sectional study with AUD-diagnosed patients (DSM-5) (n=24) recruited from an outpatient  Alcohol Programme and matched controls (n=34). Participants were assessed by the validated  Test of Detection of Cognitive Impairment in Alcoholism (TEDCA). APOE4 presence in plasma (distinguishing APOE4 carriers and no carriers subjects) and its levels were performed by  e4Quant technique. The rest of biological markers were tested by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay kits.\n\nResultsPlasma APOE4 isoform was present in 37.5% and 58.8% of patients and controls, respectively. Quantification analyses revealed that APOE4 reached similar plasma levels in carriers independently if they were AUD subjects or controls. Circulant plasma APOE4 had a negative effect on AUDs cognition, specifically affecting Memory/Learning (p<0.01, {eta}2=0.15). Plasma Clusterin and Reelin increased in patients but, interestingly, Reelin plasma levels peaked in patients expressing APOE4 (p<0.05, {eta}2=0.09), who showed reduced VLDL and ApoER2 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Reelin was a good predictor of cognitive loss in patients, accounting for the 42.3% and 54.0% of general intelligence and executive function impairments, respectively.\n\nConclusionsReelin plasma levels are increased in AUD patients who express the APOE4 isoform, predicting cognitive deterioration to a great extent. Remarkably, plasma Reelin helps to differentiate between AUD patients with and without cognitive decline.\n\nSignificance StatementFinding biological markers that predict a worse evolution in neuropsychiatric disorders may help to assist vulnerable patients appropriately. In this sense, in this study we found a biological marker, Reelin, which is elevated in patients with diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD) that underwent an outpatient treatment. Interestingly, Reelin plasma levels were elevated in patients that also express APOE4, an aberrant protein present only in a small percentage of the population which is related to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment (i.e. it is involved in Alzheimers disease). We observed that Reelin plasma levels negatively correlate with cognitive scores, being Reelin a good predictor of cognitive impairment in patients. These results may have implications for the follow-up of AUD patients in outpatient treatment.",

In order to support global, diverse, direct-to-participant clinical research studies, we developed a novel method of sampling the subgingival microbiome by rotationally swabbing the supragingival area, which we named subgingival-P (for proxy) samples. To validate this method, we sampled and metatranscriptomically analyzed subgingival and subgingival-P samples of three different teeth in 20 individuals. The subgingival-P samples were comparable to the subgingival samples in the relative abundances of microorganisms and microbial gene expression levels. Our data demonstrate that the novel method of collecting and analyzing the subgingival-P samples can act as a proxy for the subgingiva, paving the way for large and diverse studies investigating the role of the subgingival microbiome in health and disease.",

We show that astrocytes, through production of glypican 5 (GPC5), are required for maturation and refinement of synapses in the developing mouse cortex. In the absence of astrocyte GPC5 thalamocortical synapses in the visual cortex show structural immaturity during the critical period, including smaller presynaptic terminals, decreased postsynaptic density area, and presence of more postsynaptic partners at multisynaptic connections. This structural immaturity is accompanied by a delay in developmental incorporation of GLUA2-containing calcium impermeable AMPARs at intracortical synapses. The functional impact of this is that mice lacking astrocyte GPC5 exhibit increased levels of ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood. This shows astrocyte GPC5 is necessary for maturation and stabilization of synaptic connections in typical development, with implications for understanding disorders with altered synaptic function, including Alzheimers disease, where GPC5 levels are altered.",

Tau35 mice develop progressive abnormalities including increased phosphorylated tau, enhanced HCN channel expression and decreased dendritic branching, as well as reduced synapse density that is accompanied by vesicle clustering defects. Notably, altered spine density and increased HCN channel expression in Tau35 neurons correlates with functional abnormalities in network properties, including enhanced hyperpolarization-induced membrane voltage  sag and changes in the frequency and kinetics of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our findings are consistent with pathological changes in tauopathies impacting on HCN channels to drive network-wide structural and functional synaptic deficits, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

High pathologic tau stage (Braak stage) or a high burden of hippocampal tau pathology have been associated with cognitive impairment in PART. However, the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PART are not well understood. Cognitive impairment in many neurodegenerative diseases correlates with synaptic loss, raising the question of whether synaptic loss occurs in PART. To address this, we investigated synaptic changes associated with tau Braak stage and a high tau pathology burden in PART using synaptophysin and phospho-tau immunofluorescence. We compared twelve cases of definite PART with six young controls and six Alzheimers disease cases. In this study, we identified loss of synaptophysin puncta and intensity in the CA2 region of the hippocampus in cases of PART with either a high stage (Braak IV) or a high burden of neuritic tau pathology. There was also loss of synaptophysin intensity in CA3 associated with a high stage or high burden of tau pathology. Loss of synaptophysin signal was present in AD, but the pattern was distinct from that seen in PART. These novel findings suggest the presence of synaptic loss in PART associated with either a high hippocampal tau burden or a Braak stage IV. These synaptic changes raise the possibility that synaptic loss in PART could contribute to cognitive impairment, though future studies including cognitive assessments are needed to address this question.",

Immunostaining and single nucleus RNA sequencing confirmed that INPP5D expression in the adult human brain is largely restricted to microglia. Examination of prefrontal cortex across a large cohort revealed reduced full length INPP5D protein levels in AD patient brains compared to cognitively normal controls. The functional consequences of reduced INPP5D activity were evaluated in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglia (iMGLs), using both pharmacological inhibition of the phosphatase activity of INPP5D and genetic reduction in copy number. Unbiased transcriptional and proteomic profiling of iMGLs suggested an upregulation of innate immune signaling pathways, lower levels of scavenger receptors, and altered inflammasome signaling with INPP5D reduction. INPP5D inhibition induced the secretion of IL-1{beta} and IL-18, further implicating inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation was confirmed through visualization of inflammasome formation through ASC immunostaining in INPP5D-inhibited iMGLs, increased cleaved caspase-1 and through rescue of elevated IL-1{beta} and IL-18 with caspase-1 and NLRP3 inhibitors. This work implicates INPP5D as a regulator of inflammasome signaling in human microglia.",

In this study we have leveraged genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to cluster patients based on their genetic status across identified risk variants for five NDDs (Alzheimers disease [AD], Parkinsons disease [PD], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Lewy body dementia [LBD], and frontotemporal dementia [FTD]). The multi-disease and disease-specific clustering results presented here provide evidence that NDDs have more overlapping genetic etiology than previously expected and how neurodegeneration should be viewed as a spectrum of symptomology. These clustering analyses also show potential subsets of patients with these diseases that are significantly depleted for any known common genetic risk factors suggesting environmental or other factors at work. Establishing that NDDs with overlapping pathologies share genetic risk loci, future research into how these variants might have different effects on downstream protein expression, pathology and NDD manifestation in general is important for refining and treating NDDs.",

Short-term treatment with the clinically advanced GSK3 inhibitor, tideglusib, reduced skeletal and cardiac muscle necrosis, improving force production and diastolic function. Similar benefits were found when GSK3 inhibition via lithium supplementation was combined with voluntary wheel running. In the brain, GSK3 was found to be overactive in the hippocampus from mdx mice; and inhibiting GSK3 improved cognitive function. Further, this result was associated with reduced beta-secretase activity and increased clearance of {beta}-amyloid.

It plays a primary role in regulating stress, the sleep-wake cycle, and attention, and its degradation is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive deficits (e.g., Parkinsons, Alzheimers). Yet precisely how norepinephrine drives brain networks to support healthy cognitive function remains poorly understood - partly because LCs small size makes it difficult to study noninvasively in humans. Here, we characterized LCs influence on brain dynamics using a hidden Markov model fitted to functional neuroimaging data from healthy young adults across four attention-related brain networks and LC. We modulated LC activity using a behavioral paradigm and measured individual differences in LC neuromelanin. The model revealed five hidden states, including a stable state dominated by salience-network activity that occurred when subjects actively engaged with the task. LC neuromelanin correlated with this states stability across experimental manipulations and with subjects propensity to enter into and remain in this state. These results provide new insight into LCs role in driving spatiotemporal neural patterns associated with attention, and demonstrate that neuromelanin variation can explain individual differences in these patterns even in healthy young adults.",

        "abstract": "Pathological tau aggregates propagate across functionally connected neuronal networks in human neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimers disease. However, the mechanism underlying this process is poorly understood. Several studies have showed that tau release is dependent on neuronal activity and that pathological tau is found in the extracellular space in free form, as well as in the lumen of extracellular vesicles. We recently showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor activity and the SNAP25 integrity modulate the release of pathological tau from human and mouse synaptosomes. Here, we have leveraged botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), which impair neurotransmitter release by cleaving specific synaptic SNARE proteins, to dissect molecular mechanisms related to tau release at synapses. In particular, we have tested the effect of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) on the synaptic release of tau in primary mouse neurons. Hippocampal neurons were grown in microfluidic chambers and transduced with lentiviruses expressing human tau (hTau). We found that neuronal stimulation significantly increases the release of mutant hTau, whereas wild-type hTau is unaffected. Importantly, BoNT/A blocks mutant hTau release, indicating that this process is modulated by SNAP25 in intact neurons. These results suggest that BoNTs are potent tools to study the spreading of pathological proteins in neurodegenerative diseases and will play a central role in identifying novel molecular targets for the development of therapeutic interventions to treat tauopathies.",

By identifying patterns within patent data resources, researchers can gain insight into the market trends and priorities of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as providing additional perspectives on more fundamental aspects such as the emergence of potential new drug targets. In this paper, we used the patent enrichment tool, PEMT, to extract, integrate, and analyse patent literature for rare diseases (RD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). This is followed by a systematic review of the underlying patent landscape to decipher trends and applications in patent for these diseases. To do so, we discuss prominent organisations involved in drug discovery research in AD and RD. This allows us to gain an understanding of the importance of AD and RD from specific organisational (pharmaceutical or university) perspectives. Next, we analyse the historical focus of patents in relation to individual therapeutic targets and correlate them with market scenarios allowing the identification of prominent targets for a disease. Lastly, we identified drug repurposing activities within the two diseases with the help of patents. This resulted in identifying existing repurposed drugs and novel potential therapeutic approaches applicable to the indication areas. The study demonstrates the expanded applicability of patent documents from legal to drug discovery, design, and research, thus, providing a valuable resource for future drug discovery efforts.",

In the brain, it has gained fame as an important endogenous degrader of amyloid beta peptide, responsible for the pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease. Nep is expressed specifically by parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory neurons in the adult cortex, the maturation of which regulates critical period plasticity. Given that PV neuron soma and proximal dendrites are primary sites of perineuronal net (PNN) formation, we investigated the role that Nep plays in PNN and PV neuron maturation and cortical development in the mouse visual cortex, using mice whose Nep expression is constitutively knocked out (Nep KO mice). Nep expression is high in young wildtype mice (P10) and is downregulated rapidly throughout postnatal development. It is especially prominent in layer 5 where it is highly expressed by inhibitory neurons and also expressed at low levels by many excitatory neurons. Contrary to our hypothesis, Nep KO mice did not show an alteration in the relative density or gross morphology of PNNs. Instead, Nep KO mice showed reduced maximal activation of L5 after white matter stimulation and decreased number of inhibitory neurons in L4. These laminar defects may lead to impaired development of optomotor acuity in Nep KO mice.",

Monitoring the transformation process of tau from physiological monomers into pathological oligomers or aggregates in a high-throughput, quantitative manner and in a cellular context is still a major challenge in the field. Identifying molecules able to interfere with those processes is of high therapeutic interest. Here, we developed a series of inter- and intramolecular tau biosensors based on the highly sensitive Nanoluciferase (Nluc) binary technology (NanoBiT) able to monitor the pathological conformational change and self-interaction of tau in living cells. Our repertoire of tau biosensors reliably report i. molecular proximity of physiological full-length tau at microtubules; ii. changes in tau conformation and self-interaction associated with tau phosphorylation, as well as iii. tau interaction induced by seeds of recombinant tau or from mouse brain lysates of a mouse model of tau pathology. By comparing biosensors comprising different tau forms (i.e. full-length or short fragments, wild-type or the disease-associated tau(P301L) variant) further insights in the tau transformation process are obtained. Proof-of-concept data for the high-throughput suitability and identification of molecules interfering with the pathological tau transformation processes are presented. This novel repertoire of tau biosensors is aimed to boost the disclosure of molecular mechanisms underlying pathological tau transformation in living cells and to discover new drug candidates for tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

Oral contraceptives (OC) and hormone therapy (HT) and are both common sources of exogenous estrogen for women in reproductive and post-menopausal years, respectively. Here we examined the association of exogenous sex hormone exposure with the brains white matter (WM) aging trajectories in postmenopausal women using and not using OC and HT (HT users: n=3,033, non-users n=5,093; OC users: n=6,964; non-users n=1,156), while also investigating multiple dMRI models. Cross-sectional brain dMRI data was analyzed from the UK Biobank using conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the tensor distribution function (TDF), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). Mean skeletonized diffusivity measures were extracted across the whole brain, and fractional polynomial regressions were used to characterize age-related trajectories for WM microstructural measures. Advanced dMRI model NODDI revealed a steeper WM aging trajectory in HT users relative to non-users, and for those using unopposed estrogens relative to combined estrogens treatment. By contrast, no interaction was detected between OC status and age effects on the diffusivity measures we examined. Exogenous sex hormone exposure may negatively impact WM microstructure aging in postmenopausal women. We also present normative reference curves for white matter microarchitectural parameters in women, to help identify individuals with microstructural anomalies.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorylation of tau at sites associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) likely plays a role in the disease progression. Mitochondrial impairment, correlating with increased presence of phosphorylated tau, has been identified as a contributing factor to neurodegenerative processes in AD. However, how tau phosphorylated at specific sites impacts mitochondrial function has not been fully defined. We examined how AD-relevant phosphomimetics of tau impact selected aspects of mitochondrial biology. To mimic phosphorylation at AD-associated sites, the Ser/Thr sites in wild-type GFP tagged-tau (T4) were converted to glutamic acid (E) to make pseudophosphorylated GFP tagged-Ser-396/404 (2EC) and GFP tagged-Thr-231/Ser-235 (2EM) constructs. These constructs were expressed in neuronal HT22 cells and their impact on specific mitochondrial functions and responses to stressors were measured. Phosphomimetic tau altered mitochondrial distribution. Specifically, mitochondria accumulated in the soma of cells expressing either 2EC or 2EM, and neurite-like extensions in 2EC cells were shorter. Additionally, ATP levels were reduced in both 2EC and 2EM expressing cells, and ROS production increased in 2EC cells during oxidation of succinate when compared to T4 expressing cells. Thapsigargin reduced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Psi}m) and increased ROS production in both 2EC and 2EM cells relative to T4 cells, with no significant difference in the effects of rotenone. These results show that tau phosphorylation at specific AD-relevant epitopes negatively affects mitochondria, with the extent of dysfunction and stress response varying according to the sites of phosphorylation. Altogether, these findings extend our understanding of potential mechanisms whereby phosphorylated tau promotes mitochondria dysfunction in tauopathies, including AD.\n\nFunding informationR01 AG067617",

        "abstract": "The precise timing of neuronal spiking relative to the brains endogenous oscillations (i.e., phase-locking or spike-phase coupling) has long been hypothesized to coordinate cognitive processes and maintain excitatory-inhibitory homeostasis. Indeed, disruptions in theta phase-locking have been described in models of neurological diseases with associated cognitive deficits and seizures, such as Alzheimers disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. However, due to technical limitations, determining if phase-locking causally contributes to these disease phenotypes has not been possible until recently. To fill this gap and allow for the flexible manipulation of single-unit phase-locking to on-going endogenous oscillations, we developed PhaSER, an open-source tool that allows for phase-specific manipulations. PhaSER can deliver optogenetic stimulation at defined phases of theta in order to shift the preferred firing phase of neurons relative to theta in real-time. Here, we describe and validate this tool in a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons that express somatostatin (SOM) in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the dorsal hippocampus. We show that PhaSER is able to accurately deliver a photo-manipulation that activates opsin+ SOM neurons at specified phases of theta in real-time in awake, behaving mice. Further, we show that this manipulation is sufficient to alter the preferred firing phase of opsin+ SOM neurons without altering the referenced theta power or phase. All software and hardware requirements to implement real-time phase manipulations during behavior are available online (https://github.com/ShumanLab/PhaSER).",

        "abstract": "Cumulative evidence suggests that somatosensorial stimulation through exposure to enriched environments improves homeostasis and enhances central nervous system functions. Immune system functions are also modulated by exposure to enriched environments, which enhance phagocytosis and chemotaxis while attenuating the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide exposure or hypercaloric diets. Consistent with these, here we show that exposure to an enriched environment attenuates inflammation in the colon in two colitis experimental models. Exposing animals to an enriched environment reduced weight loss, colon length shortening, and decreased disease activity index after dextran sodium sulfate or trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid treatment, compared with animals housed in a normal environment. Histologically, after colitis induction, exposure to an enriched environment reduced epithelial damage, lessened the inflammation, and attenuated loss of goblet cells compared to animals housed in a normal environment. Our results also show that brain stimulation by exposure to an enriched environment attenuates inflammation in the intestinal mucosa by preventing epithelial barrier dysfunction through BDNF-mediated expression of cell adhesion molecules. At the molecular level, there is a global change in gene expression and gene regulatory networks as a response to dextran treatment. Interestingly, a Myc-driven gene regulatory network enhanced by colitis is attenuated by exposure to an enriched environment, via downmodulation of Myc protein levels. Together, our results show that brain stimulation by exposure to an enriched environment attenuates inflammation in the gut mucosa by fine-tuning an inflammatory gene expression program, opening new venues of investigation for colitis treatment.\n\nSignificance StatementBrain stimulation by exposure to an enriched environment improves the function of different systems in the organism including the immune and central nervous systems. Congruently, an enriched environment attenuates the development of diverse pathologies including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, metabolic alterations resulting from obesity, cancer, and autoimmunity. In agreement with the fact that inflammation is a key factor promoting these maladies, here we show that brain stimulation by exposure to an enriched environment attenuates inflammation in the gut mucosa and improves epithelial barrier functions by fine-tuning a Myc-driven inflammatory gene regulatory network.",

Our understanding of the proteins that promote A{beta} fibril formation and mediate neurotoxicity has been limited due to technical challenges in isolating pure amyloid fibrils from brain extracts.\n\nMethodsTo investigate how amyloid fibrils form and cause neurotoxicity in AD brain, we developed a robust biochemical strategy. We benchmarked the success of our purifications using electron microscopy, amyloid dyes, and a large panel of A{beta} immunoassays. Tandem mass-spectrometry based proteomic analysis workflows provided quantitative measures of the amyloid fibril proteome. These methods allowed us to compare amyloid fibril composition from human AD brains, three amyloid mouse models, transgenic A{beta}42 flies, and A{beta}42 seeded cultured neurons.\n\nResultsAmyloid fibrils are primarily composed by A{beta}42 and unexpectedly harbor A{beta}38 but generally lack A{beta}40 peptides. Multidimensional quantitative proteomics allowed us to redefine the fibril proteome by identifying 17 new amyloid-associated proteins. Notably, we confirmed 126 previously reported plaque-associated proteins. We validated a panel of these proteins as bona fide amyloid-interacting proteins using antibodies and orthogonal proteomic analysis. One metal-binding chaperone metallothionein-3 is tightly associated with amyloid fibrils and modulates fibril formation in vitro. Lastly, we used a transgenic A{beta}42 fly model to test if knock down or over-expression of fibril-interacting gene homologues modifies neurotoxicity. Eight RNAi lines suppressed and 11 enhanced A{beta}42 toxicity.\n\nConclusionsThese discoveries and subsequent confirmation indicate that fibril-associated proteins play a key role in amyloid formation and AD pathology.",

SNP-based heritability was 0.060 (SE=0.004, p=7.83x10-66). GWAS analysis identified 15 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci at p<5x10-8. Gene-based analyses revealed 14 gene-wide significant genes, including NCAM1, APOE, FTO, and FOXP2. Gene tissue expression analysis identified the brain as significantly enriched, particularly in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Genetic correlations with TBI were significant for risk-taking behaviors and psychiatric disorders, but generally not significant for the neurocognitive variables investigated. gSEM analysis revealed stronger associations with risk-taking traits than with psychiatric traits. Finally, the genetic architecture of TBI was similar to polygenic psychiatric disorders. Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease showed much less polygenicity, however, the proportion of shared variance with TBI was high. This first well-powered GWAS of TBI identified 15 loci including genes relevant to TBI biology, and showed that TBI is a heritable trait with comparable genetic architecture and high genetic correlation with psychiatric traits. Our findings set the stage for future TBI GWASs that focus on injury severity and diversity and chronicity of symptom sequelae.",

        "abstract": "Over two decades, epidemiological studies have revealed that interactions between human polymorphic apolipoprotein 4 (ApoE, isoform 4) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) associate with higher risk of Alzheimers disease, a serious and increasing issue among elder populations worldwide. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms behind ApoE-HSV1 interactions at molecular levels. Here, we investigate the effects of ApoE on the HSV1 infectious life cycle in in vitro cell experiments. Analysis of HSV1 growth curves shows that HSV1 production is promoted in presence of any of the three ApoE isoforms, with ApoE 3or 4 demonstrating more efficient pro-viral effects than ApoE 2. When added prior to infection, ApoE inhibits viral attachment but does not affect viral entry. qPCR-based quantification reveals that harbouring ApoE 2, 3, or 4 leads to an increase of HSV1 extracellular release but unchanged levels of viral genome copies within cells or on the cell surface, indicating that virus replication, assembly, or transport to cell membrane are not affected. Further test of virus release directly demonstrates that HSV1 detachment from the cell surface is promoted by ApoE. Subsequent results reveal that ApoE is not only present in purified HSV1 particles produced in ApoE-expressing cells after ultra-centrifugation but also able to incorporate into HSV1 particles after purification, suggesting that harbouring ApoE may promote HSV1 detachment. With the help of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM), this hypothesis was tested by quantifying interaction kinetics and apparent affinity between of HSV1 and native supported lipid bilayer. HSV1 particle decorated with ApoE demonstrates higher dissociation rate constants (koff) and less irreversible binding to the membrane, which is in line with the promoted virus release. Similar interaction kinetics have also been tested between non-decorated HSV1 particles and membranes harbouring ApoE but revealed no difference in the kinetics of virus particles on membranes with ApoE present or absent. Overall, our results provide new insights into the roles of ApoE during HSV1 infections, which is worth to be considered when studying their involvement during AD development.",

        "abstract": "Microbes in human brain and their potential contribution to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimers disease (AD) have long been debated. We recently developed a new method (the electronic tree of life, eToL) based on small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) probes, further confirmed by large subunit rRNA analysis, to comprehensively address the spectrum of microorganisms in control and AD brain. We report a remarkable diversity of brain microbes in control brain. The most abundant are fungi, bacteria, and chloroplastida, and we report detailed identification of representative microbial species. The pattern is substantially conserved across different bilateran species from Drosophila to human. In terms of diversity, the human brain microbiome appears to be a subset (~20%) of the gut microbiome. Adenovirus type C was the major virus found in human brain; other viruses were not well represented. However, the spectrum of brain microbes differed between individuals as well as between brain regions examined from single individuals (amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus); of these four regions, the highest microbial burden was in cingulate cortex. There was evidence of spreading of pathogens between brain regions in single individuals. Some microbes are over-represented in AD brain according to two measures: (i) absolute number of microbes normalized to endogenous human transcripts, and (ii) the number of brain specimens showing overabundance versus control. Species over-represented in AD brain according to both measures notably include bacteria (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus/Bacillus, Sphingomonas/Ralstonia) and fungi (Acrocalymma/Altenaria/Aureobasidium of the Aspergillus group; Komagataella of the Candida group, Cortinarius of the Schizophyllum group, and Tausonia of the Cryptococcus group), that are all related to known human pathogens. In addition, an uncharacterized chloroplastida (algae-related) species was more abundant in AD brain samples. Although these findings point to diverse microbial species, indicative of multiple causation, similar absolute levels of bacteria and fungi in AD brain samples could suggest synergy between pathogens. However, it is important to stress that not all AD samples were positive for these microbes, but this could be because the affected brain region(s) was not examined. These findings support the contention that infection, perhaps associated with declining immunity with age, may contribute to AD development.",

Oral care is attracting high interest in Japan, which has entered a super-aging society. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether commercially available Hinora(R) (HO) that oral care gels-containing hinokitiol and 4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol (IPMP) have biofilm formation inhibitory and antibacterial activities against various intraoral pathogen microorganisms. Method: Candida spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were selected during the study period, all which were analyzed using antimicrobial disc, microorganism turbidity, and crystal violet assays. In addition, the germ tube test using C. albicans was performed with a modification of Mackenzies method. Images for morphological observation of the germ tubes were acquired with an inverted microscope. For comparison between products, we used Refrecare(R) (RC), which contains only hinokitiol (not containing IPMP). Results: All the intraoral pathogenic microorganisms showed drug susceptibility against undiluted form HO and/or RC. In particular, HO was more effective at lower concentrations than RC. In the HO-added group, inhibition circles were observed in all bacteria except P. aeruginosa when added at a concentration of 0.5 g/mL or more. The optical density values at 590 nm (crystal violet) and/or 600 nm (microorganism turbidity) of all the fungi and bacteria were significantly lower when cultured in medium with HO. Inhibition of growth or biofilm formation was observed when HO was added at a concentration of 0.05 g/mL or higher. To investigate the action mechanism of HO, germ tube tests were performed in C. albicans. The results show that culturing C. albicans in soyabean-casein digest broth with HO (0.05 g/mL) significantly suppressed germ tube formation. Conclusions: These data suggest that oral care gel-containing hinokitiol and IPMP has strong biofilm formation inhibitory, antifungal and antibacterial effects against Candida fungi and multiple intraoral pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, it may be a promising treatment option for oral infections.",

        "abstract": "Brain cells are influenced by continuous fluid shear stress driven by varying hydrostatic and osmotic pressure conditions, depending on the brains pathophysiological conditions. While all brain cells are sensitive to the subtle changes in various physicochemical factors in the microenvironment, microglia, the resident brain immune cells, exhibit the most dramatic morphodynamic transformation. However, little is known about the phenotypic alterations in microglia in response to the changes in fluid shear stress. In this study, we first established a flow-controlled microenvironment to investigate the effects of shear flow on microglial phenotypes, including morphology, motility, and activation states. Microglia exhibited two distinct morphologies with different migratory phenotypes in a static condition: bipolar cells that oscillate along their long axis and unipolar cells that migrate persistently. When exposed to flow, a significant fraction of bipolar cells showed unstable oscillation with an increased amplitude of oscillation and a decreased frequency, which consequently led to the phenotypic transformation of oscillating cells into migrating cells. Interestingly, the level of pro-inflammatory genes increased in response to shear stress, while there were no significant changes in the level of anti-inflammatory genes. Our findings suggest that an interstitial fluid-level stimulus can cause a dramatic phenotypic shift in microglia toward pro-inflammatory states, shedding light on pathological outbreaks of severe brain diseases. Given that the fluidic environment in the brain can be locally disrupted in pathological circumstances, the mechanical stimulus by a fluid flow should also be considered a crucial element in regulating the immune activities of the microglia in brain diseases.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCellular morphology and motility are important factors that encompass the alterations in protein and gene-level expressions within cells. In pathological conditions, microglia, the resident brain immune cells, are known to undergo morphodynamic transformations in response to various physicochemical stimuli. Besides the commonly known soluble biochemical factors in the microenvironment, the differential flow characteristics of ISF have been linked to several neurological diseases, such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and brain tumors. Microglial cells, which are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in extracellular stimuli, have been identified as key players in these pathological conditions. Despite its importance, however, it has been challenging to study the sole effect of a shear flow on microglia. We investigated the morphodynamic features of microglia in response to precisely controlled interstitial-level fluid flow conditions using a microfluidic system in which isolated microglia are monitored in real-time while the undesirable effects from other extracellular factors are minimized.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) is a normal product of neuronal activity, and the two most common variants are 40 or 42 residues long. Of these, the 42 residue-version (A{beta}42) is normally less abundant but more prone to self-aggregate, and is thought to cause Alzheimers disease (AD). Much knowledge about AD-pathogenesis comes from the study of rodents made to model aspects of the disease by expressing AD-relevant human transgenes, like human amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing mutations that drive up A{beta} production or increase the A{beta}42/40 ratio and thereby causes AD. Yet, when it comes to the normal expression of A{beta}42 in rodent brains, surprisingly little is known. Here we characterize the expression of A{beta}42 throughout the brain of normal, outbred Wistar rats, including animals from 3-18 months of age. We find that intracellular A{beta}42 (iA{beta}42) is present in neurons located throughout the brain at all ages of normal Wistar rats, but that the levels vary greatly between brain regions. In cortex, we observe the highest levels of iA{beta}42 in neurons that are part of layer II of the entorhinal cortex (EC), along with neurons in the hippocampus, closely followed by neurons in the somatosensory cortex. Among subcortical structures, we observe the highest levels iA{beta}42 in the locus coeruleus. In order to explore whether the striking presence of iA{beta}42 in rat EC also holds true in human subject free of neurological disease, we examined EC of six such cases ranging from ages 20-88 years. In all six cases, we find that iA{beta}42 is present in EC layer II-neurons.\n\nOur findings support two conclusions about iA{beta}42. First, iA{beta}42 is present in neurons of wild-type Wistar rats and is restricted to the same structures where iA{beta} accumulates, and A{beta}-plaques form, in a much used AD model based on Wistar rats (the McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat model). The difference between wild-type Wistar rats and these AD model rats, with respect to A{beta}42, is therefore a quantitative one rather that a qualitative one. This indicates that the McGill rat model in fact models the underlying wild-type neuronal population-specific vulnerability to A{beta}42-accumulation. Second, because the McGill rat model closely mimics the human AD-associated spatiotemporal sequence of amyloid plaque deposition, this model may offer a useful representation of the pre-plaque neuronal accumulation of iA{beta}42. Our findings in human cases are in line with prior findings, and substantiate the notion that neurons in layer II of EC are vulnerable to accumulation of iA{beta}42.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundWhite matter hyperintensities are an important marker of cerebral small vessel diseases. This disease burden is commonly described as hyperintense areas in the cerebral white matter, as seen on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging data. Studies have demonstrated associations with various cognitive impairments, neurological diseases, and neuropathologies, as well as clinical and risk factors, such as age, sex, and hypertension. Due to their heterogeneous appearance in location and size, studies have started to investigate spatial distributions and patterns, beyond summarizing this cerebrovascular disease burden in a single metric - its volume. Here, we review the evidence of association of white matter hyperintensity spatial patterns with its risk factors and clinical diagnoses.\n\nDesign/MethodsWe have performed a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement. We used the standards for reporting vascular changes on neuroimaging criteria to construct a search string for literature search on PubMed. Studies written in English from the earliest records available until January 31st, 2023, were eligible for inclusion if they reported on spatial patterns of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin.\n\nResultsA total of 372 studies were identified by the initial literature search, of which 37 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies included cohorts based on mild cognitive impairment (15/37), Alzheimers Disease (12/37), Dementia (5/37), Parkinsons Disease (3/37), subjective cognitive decline (2/37). Additionally 4 of 37 studies investigated cognitive normal, older cohorts, two of which were population-based, or other clinical findings such as acute ischemic stroke or reduced cardiac output. Cohorts ranged from 32 to 882 patients/participants (median cohort size 191.5 and 50.2 % female (range: 17.9 - 81.3 %)). The studies included in this review have identified spatial heterogeneity of WMHs with various impairments, diseases, and pathologies as well as with sex and (cerebro)vascular risk factors.\n\nConclusionsThe results show that studying white matter hyperintensities on a more granular level might give a deeper understanding of the underlying neuropathology and their effects. This motivates further studies examining the spatial patterns of white matter hyperintensities.",

However, the spectrum of diseases for individuals with a genetic predisposition to COVID-19 remains unclear.\n\nMethodsWe leveraged individual-level data from UK Biobank to implement a phenome-wide association study to explore the relationships between COVID-19 and 1061 diseases. Then, the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was adopted with summary-level data from global consortiums as sensitivity analyses combined with other MR methods with different model assumptions to identify robust associations.\n\nFindingsThe PheWAS found severe respiratory, hospitalized, and susceptibility COVID-19 had detrimental effects on 36, 37, and 51 kinds of diseases, separately. The IVW test found severe respiratory COVID-19 had detrimental effects on breast cancer [OR 95% CI: 1.065 (1.000-1.133)], pan-cancer [OR 95% CI: 1.002 (1.000-1.004)], and Alzheimers disease [OR 95% CI: 1.042 (1.005-1.081)], etc. Hospitalized COVID-19 had detrimental effects on ischemic stroke (IS) [OR 95%CI: 1.049 (1.001-1.100)], breast cancer [OR 95%CI: 1.139 (1.011-1.283)], and pan-cancer [OR 95%CI: 1.003 (1.000-1.006)], etc. Susceptibility COVID-19 had detrimental effects on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of lower extremities [OR 95%CI: 2.392 (1.167-4.902)], venous thromboembolism [OR 95%CI: 1.962 (1.115-3.453)], pulmonary heart disease/diseases of pulmonary circulation [OR 95%CI: 1.767 (1.142-2.733)], IS (large artery atherosclerosis) [OR 95%CI: 1.405 (1.025-1.927)], myocardial infarction [OR 95%CI: 1.235 (1.012-1.509)], heart failure [OR 95%CI: 1.140 (1.009-1.287)], etc.\n\nInterpretationThis study describes the extensive link between genetically determined COVID-19 and a broad range of diseases, especially those of the circulatory system, neuropsychiatric system, neoplasms, immune system, and digestive systems. Early detection and management of post-COVID-19 conditions could be tremendously beneficial to public health.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81773547 and 82173625) and the National Key Research and Development Program (2020YFC2003500).",

        "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) and other tauopathies are characterized by the aggregation of tau into soluble and insoluble forms (including tangles and neuropil threads). In humans, a fraction of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated N-terminal to mid-domain tau species, including the aggregated forms, are secreted into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some of these CSF tau species can be measured as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, starting from early stages of disease. While in animal models of AD pathology, soluble tau aggregates have been shown to disrupt neuronal function, it is unclear whether the tau species present in CSF will modulate neural activity. Here, we have developed and applied a novel approach to examine the electrophysiological effects of CSF from patients with a tau-positive biomarker profile. The method involves incubation of acutely-isolated wild-type mouse hippocampal brain slices with small volumes of diluted human CSF, followed by a suite of electrophysiological recording methods to evaluate their effects on neuronal function from single cells through to the network level. Comparison of the toxicity profiles of the same CSF samples, with and without immuno-depletion for tau, has enabled a pioneering demonstration that CSF-tau potently modulates neuronal function. We demonstrate that CSF-tau mediates an increase in neuronal excitability in single cells. We then observed, at the network level, increased input-output responses and enhanced paired-pulse facilitation as well as an increase in long-term potentiation. Finally, we show that CSF-tau modifies the generation and maintenance of hippocampal theta oscillations, which have important roles in learning and memory and are known to be altered in AD patients. Together, we describe a novel method for screening human CSF-tau to understand functional effects on neuron and network activity, which could have far-reaching benefits in understanding tau pathology, thus allowing for the development of better targeted treatments for tauopathies in the future.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=98 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525362v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13f564forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13b75cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b27dbaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c68c0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
