    "preprint_abstract": "Peripheral membrane-associated proteins are known to accumulate on the surface of biomembranes as result of membrane-mediated interactions. For a pair of rotationally-symmetric curvature-inducing proteins, membrane mechanics at the low-temperature limit predicts pure repulsion. On the other hand, temperature-dependent entropic forces arise between pairs of stiff-binding proteins suppressing membrane fluctuations. These Casimir-like interactions have thus been suggested as candidates for attractive force leading to aggregation. With dense assemblies of peripheral proteins on the membrane, both these abstractions encounter multi-body complications. Here, we make use of a particle-based membrane model augmented with flexible peripheral proteins to quantify purely membrane-mediated interactions and investigate their underlying nature. We introduce a continuous reaction coordinate corresponding to the progression of protein aggregation. We obtain free energy and entropy landscapes for different surface concentrations along this reaction coordinate. In parallel, we investigate time-dependent estimates of membrane entropy corresponding to membrane undulations and coarse-grained tilt field and how they also change dynamically with protein aggregation. Congruent outcomes of the two approaches point to the conclusion that for low surface concentrations, interactions with an entropic nature may drive the aggregation. But at high concentrations, energetic contributions due to concerted membrane deformation by protein clusters are dominant.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Analyzing diversification dynamics is key to understanding the past evolutionary history of clades that led to present-day biodiversity patterns. While such analyses are widespread in well-characterized groups of species, they are much more challenging in groups which diversity is mostly known through molecular techniques. Here, we use the largest global database on the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of Glomeromycotina, a subphylum of microscopic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that provide mineral nutrients to most land plants by forming one of the oldest terrestrial symbioses, to analyze the diversification dynamics of this clade in the past 500 million years (Myr). We perform a range of sensitivity analyses and simulations to control for potential biases linked to the nature of the data. We find that Glomeromycotina tend to have low speciation rates compared to other eukaryotes. After a peak of speciations between 200 and 100 Myr ago, they experienced an important decline in speciation rates toward the present. Such a decline could be at least partially related to a shrinking of their mycorrhizal niches and to their limited ability to colonize new niches. Our analyses identify patterns of diversification in a group of obligate symbionts of major ecological and evolutionary importance and illustrate that short molecular markers combined with intensive sensitivity analyses can be useful for studying diversification dynamics in microbial groups.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tracking how individual human brains change over extended timescales is crucial in scenarios ranging from healthy aging to stroke recovery. Tracking these neuroplastic changes with resting state (RS) activity is a promising but poorly understood possibility. It remains unresolved whether a persons RS activity over time can be reliably decoded to distinguish neurophysiological changes from confounding differences in cognitive state during rest. Here, we assessed whether this confounding can be minimized by tracking the configuration of an individuals RS activity that is shaped by their distinctive neurophysiology rather than cognitive state. Using EEG, individual RS activity was acquired over five consecutive days along with activity in tasks that were devised to simulate the confounding effects of inter-day cognitive variation. As inter-individual differences are shaped by neurophysiological differences, the inter-individual differences in RS activity on one day were analyzed (using machine learning) to identify a distinctive configuration in each individuals RS activity. Using this configuration as a classifier-rule, an individual could be re-identified with high accuracy from 2-second samples of the instantaneous oscillatory power acquired on a different day both from RS and confounded-RS. Importantly, the high accuracy of cross-day classification was achieved only with classifiers that combined information from multiple frequency bands at channels across the scalp (with a concentration at characteristic fronto-central and occipital zones). These findings support the suitability of longitudinal RS to support robust individualized inferences about neurophysiological change in health and disease.",

With the aim of exploring the local infection ecology of T. betulina, we had isolated yeasts from the phylloplane of birch, using three classes of samples; from infected symptom bearing leaves inside brooms, healthy leaves from branches away from brooms on broom bearing trees, and symptom-free leaves from symptom-free trees. Isolations yielded 224 yeast strains, representing 11 taxa, including T. betulina, which was the most common isolate and was found in all sample classes, including asymptomatic leaves. Genotyping with two genetic markers revealed genetic diversity among these T. betulina isolates, with seven distinct genotype differentiated by the markers used. Of the 57 T. betulina strains, 22 representative strains were selected for further studies and preliminarily characterized, revealing differences in size and the ability to produced compounds with activity to activate the signalling pathway for the plant hormone auxin.",

A long-standing debate in cognitive science concerns the existence of a dissociation, in humans, between two systems, one for handling statistical regularities governing the probabilities of individual items and their transitions, and another for handling deterministic rules. Here, to address this issue, we used finger tracking to continuously monitor the online build-up of evidence, confidence, false alarms and changes-of-mind during sequence processing. All these aspects of behaviour conformed tightly to a hierarchical Bayesian inference model with distinct hypothesis spaces for statistics and rules, yet linked by a single probabilistic currency. Alternative models based either on a single statistical mechanism or on two non-commensurable systems were rejected. Our results indicate that a hierarchical Bayesian inference mechanism, capable of operating over distinct hypothesis spaces for statistics and rules, underlies the human capability for sequence processing.",

    "preprint_abstract": "1Although initially showing great potential, oxytocin treatment has encountered a translational hurdle in its promise of treating the social deficits of autism. Some debate surrounds the ability of oxytocin to successfully enter the brain, and therefore modify neuroanatomy. Moreover, given the heterogeneous nature of autism, treatment will only amerliorate symptoms in a subset of patients. Therefore, to determine whether oxytocin changes brain circuitry, and whether it does so variably, depending on genotype, we implemented a large randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, preclinical study on chronic intranasal oxytocin treatment in three different mouse models related to autism with a focus on using neuroanatomical phenotypes to assess and subset treatment response. Intranasal oxytocin (0.6IU) was administered daily, for 28 days, starting at 5 weeks of age to the 16p11.2 deletion, Shank3 (exon 4-9) knockout, and Fmr1 knockout mouse models. Given the sensitivity of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the neurological effects of interventions like drugs, along with many other advantages, the mice underwent in vivo longitudinal and high-resolution ex vivo imaging with MRI. The scans included three in vivo T1-weighted, 90um isotropic resolution scans and a T2-weighted, 3D fast spin echo with 40um isotropic resolution ex vivo scan to assess the changes in neuroanatomy using established automated image registration and deformation based morphometry approaches in response to oxytocin treatment. The behavior of the mice was assessed in multiple domains, including social behaviours and repetitive behaviours, among others. Treatment effect on the neuroanatomy did not reach significance, although the pattern of trending effects was promising. No significant effect of treatment was found on social behavior in any of the strains, although a significant effect of treatment was found in the Fmr1 mouse, with treatment normalizing a grooming deficit. No other treatment effect on behavior was observed that survived multiple comparisons correction. Overall, chronic treatment with oxytocin had limited effects on the three mouse models related to autism, and no promising pattern of response susceptibility emerged.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Neprosin was first discovered in the insectivorous tropical pitcher plants of Nepenthes species as a novel protease with prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) activity. Neprosin has two uncharacterized domains of neprosin activation peptide and neprosin. A previous study has shown neprosin activity in hydrolyzing proline-rich gliadin, a gluten component that triggers celiac disease. In this study, we performed in silico structure-function analysis to investigate the catalytic mechanism of neprosin. Neprosin sequences lack the catalytic triad and motifs of PEP family S9. Protein structures of neprosins from Nepenthes x ventrata (NvNpr) and N. rafflesiana (NrNpr1) were generated by ab initio methods and comparatively assessed to obtain high-quality models. Structural alignment of models to experimental structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) found a high structural similarity to glutamic peptidases. Further investigations reveal other resemblances to the glutamic peptidases with low optimum pH that activates the enzyme via autoproteolysis for maturation. Two highly conserved glutamic acid residues, which are stable according to the molecular dynamics simulation, can be found at the active site of the substrate cleft. Protein docking demonstrated that mature neprosins bind well with potent antigen I-gliadin at the putative active site. Taken together, neprosins represent a new glutamic peptidase family, with a putative catalytic dyad of two glutamic acids. This study illustrates a hypothetical enzymatic mechanism of the neprosin family and demonstrates the useful application of an accurate ab initio protein structure prediction in the structure-function study of a novel protein family.",

We present novel evidence in support of this hypothesis: the analysis of nuclear pseudogenes of mtDNA (\\\"NUMTs\\\"). NUMTs are considered \\\"mtDNA fossils\\\", as they preserve sequences of ancient mtDNA and thus carry unique information about ancestral populations. Our comparison of a NUMT sequence shared by humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas with their mtDNAs implies that, around the time of divergence between humans and chimpanzees, our evolutionary history involved the interbreeding of individuals whose mtDNA had diverged as much as ~4.5 Myr prior. This large divergence suggests a distant interspecies hybridization. Additionally, analysis of two other NUMTs suggests that such events occurred repeatedly. Our findings suggest a complex pattern of speciation in primate human ancestors and provide a potential explanation for the mosaic nature of fossil morphology found at the emergence of the hominin lineage.",

    "preprint_abstract": "It has recently been shown that CFIm25, a canonical mRNA 3 processing factor, could play a variety of physiological roles through its molecular function in the regulation of mRNA alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing approach in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for CFIm25, and obtained three gene knockdown/mutant cell lines. CFIm25 gene editing resulted in higher proliferation rate and impaired differentiation potential for hESCs, with these effects likely to be directly regulated by the target genes, including the pluripotency factor rex1. Mechanistically, we unexpected found that perturbation in CFIm25 gene expression did not significantly affect cellular mRNA 3 processing efficiency and APA profile. Rather, we provided evidences that CFIm25 may impact RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy at the body of transcribed genes, and promote the expression level of a group of transcripts associated with cellular proliferation and/or differentiation. Further study indicated that CFIm25 association with LEO1, an RNAPII associated factor, might contribute to the effect. Taken together, these results reveal novel mechanisms underlying CFIm25s modulation in determination of cell fate, and provide evidence that the process of mammalian gene transcription may be regulated by an mRNA 3 processing factor.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Understanding how point mutations can render a ligand or a drug ineffective against a given biological target is a problem of immense fundamental and practical relevance. Often the efficacy of such resistance mutations can be explained purely on a thermo-dynamic basis wherein the mutated system displays a reduced binding affinity for the ligand. However, the more perplexing and harder to explain situation is when two protein sequences have the same binding affinity for a drug. In this work, we demonstrate how all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, specifically using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics and information theory, can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We establish the dissociation mechanism for the popular anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild-type and N387S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this single point mutation triggers a non-local response in the proteins flexibility and eventually leads to pathway differentiation during dissociation. This pathway differentiation explains why Gleevec has a long residence time in the wild-type Abl, but for the mutant, by opening up a backdoor pathway for ligand exit, an order of magnitude shorter residence time is obtained. We thus believe that this work marks an efficient and scalable approach to pinpoint the molecular determinants of resistance mutations in biomolecular receptors of pharmacological relevance that are hard to explain using a simple structural perspective and require mechanistic and kinetic insights.\n\nSignificance statementRelapse in late-stage cancer patients is often correlated with the onset of drug resistance mutations. Some of these mutations are very far from the binding site and thus hard to explain from a purely structural perspective. Here we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations aided by ideas from information theory that can reach timescales of seconds with minimal human bias in how the sampling is enhanced. Through these we explain how a single point mutation triggers a non-local response in the protein kinases flexibility and eventually leads to pathway differentiation during dissociation, thereby significantly reducing the residence time of the drug.",

The complete etiology of the latter remains unknown. Here, we show that cisplatin targets a heterogeneous population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) primary afferent dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs) within the primary afferent dorsal root ganglia in mice, determined using single-cell transcriptome and electrophysiological analyses. TH+ DRGNs regulate innocuous mechanical sensation through C-low threshold mechanoreceptors. A differential assessment of wild-type and vitamin E deficient TH+ DRGNs revealed heterogeneity and specific functional phenotypes. The TH+ DRGNs comprise; fast-adapting eliciting one action potential (AP; 1-AP), moderately-adapting ([&ge;] 2-APs), in responses to square-pulse current injection, and spontaneously firing (SF). Cisplatin increased the input resistance and AP frequency but reduced the temporal coding feature of 1-AP and [&ge;] 2-APs neurons. By contrast, cisplatin has no measurable effect on the SF neurons. Vitamin E reduced the cisplatin-mediated increased excitability, but did not improve the TH+ neuron temporal coding properties. Cisplatin mediates its effect by targeting outward K+ current, likely carried by through K2P18.1 (Kcnk18), discovered through the differential transcriptome studies and heterologous expression. Studies show a potential new cellular target for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and implicate the possible neuroprotective effects of vitamin E in cisplatin chemotherapy.",

Patients with RP experience progressive visual field loss as the retina degenerates, destroying light-sensitive photoreceptor cells (rods and cones), with rods affected earlier and more severely than cones. Spatio-temporal patterns of retinal degeneration in human RP have been well characterised; however, the mechanism(s) giving rise to these patterns have not been conclusively determined. One such mechanism, which has received a wealth of experimental support, is described by the trophic factor hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that rods produce a trophic factor necessary for cone survival; the loss of rods depletes this factor, leading to cone degeneration. In this paper we formulate a partial differential equation mathematical model of RP in one spatial dimension, spanning the region between the retinal centre (fovea) and the retinal edge (ora serrata). Using this model we derive and solve an inverse problem, revealing for the first time experimentally testable conditions under which the trophic factor mechanism will qualitatively recapitulate the spatio-temporal patterns of retinal regeneration observed in human RP.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Pediatric neuroimaging is a quickly developing field that still faces important methodological challenges. One key challenge is the use of many different atlases, automated segmentation tools, manual edits in semiautomated protocols, and quality control protocols, which complicates comparisons between studies. In this article, we present our semiautomated segmentation protocol using FreeSurfer v6.0, ENIGMA consortium software, and the quality control protocol that was used in FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. We used a dichotomous quality rating scale for inclusion and exclusion of images, and then explored the quality on a region of interest level to exclude all regions with major segmentation errors. The effects of manual edits on cortical thickness values were minor: less than 2% in all regions. Supplementary materials cover registration and additional edit options in FreeSurfer and comparison to the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12). Overall, we conclude that despite minor imperfections FreeSurfer can be reliably used to segment cortical metrics from T1-weighted images of 5-year-old children with appropriate quality assessment in place. However, custom templates may be needed to optimize the results for the subcortical areas. Our semiautomated segmentation protocol provides high quality pediatric neuroimaging data and could help investigators working with similar data sets.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Biofilm formation is the most successful survival strategy for bacterial communities. In the biofilm lifestyle, bacteria embed themselves in a self-secreted matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which acts as a shield against mechanical and chemical insults. When ambient flow is present, this viscoelastic scaffold can take a streamlined shape, forming biofilm filaments suspended in flow, called streamers. Streamers significantly disrupt the fluid flow by causing rapid clogging and affect transport in aquatic environments. Despite their relevance, the structural and rheological characterization of biofilm streamers is still at an early stage. In this work, we present a microfluidic platform that allows the reproducible growth of biofilm streamers in controlled physico-chemical conditions and the characterization of their biochemical composition, morphology, and rheology in situ. We employed isolated micropillars as nucleation sites for the growth of single biofilm streamers under the continuous flow of a diluted bacterial suspension. By combining fluorescent staining of the EPS components and epifluorescence microscopy, we were able to characterize the biochemical composition and morphology of the streamers. Additionally, we optimized a protocol to perform hydrodynamic stress tests in situ, by inducing controlled variations of the fluid shear stress exerted on the streamers by the flow. Thus, the reproducibility of the formation process and the testing protocol make it possible to perform several consistent experimental replicates that provide statistically significant information. By allowing the systematic investigation of the role of biochemical composition on the structure and rheology of streamers, this platform will advance our understanding of biofilm formation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "These experiments examined whether exposure to drugs of abuse altered the balance between hippocampal and striatal memory systems as measured long after drug treatments. Male rats received injections of morphine (5 mg/kg), cocaine (20 mg/kg), or saline for five consecutive days. One month later, rats were then trained to find food on a hippocampus-sensitive place task or a striatum-sensitive response task. Relative to saline controls, morphine-treated rats exhibited impaired place learning but enhanced response learning; prior cocaine exposure did not significantly alter learning on either task. Another set of rats was trained on a dual-solution T-maze that can be solved with either place or response strategies. While a majority (67%) of control rats used place solutions in this task, morphine treatment one month prior resulted in a shift to response solutions exclusively (100%). Prior cocaine treatment did not significantly alter strategy selection. Molecular markers related to learning and drug abuse were measured in the hippocampus and striatum one month after drug exposure in behaviorally untested rats. Protein levels of glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament specific to astrocytes, increased significantly in the hippocampus after morphine, but not after cocaine exposure. Exposure to morphine or cocaine did not significantly change levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or a downstream target of BDNF signaling, glycogen synthase kinase 3{beta} (GSK3{beta}), in the hippocampus or striatum. Thus, exposure to morphine results in a long-lasting shift from hippocampal toward striatal dominance during learning. The effects of prior morphine injections on GFAP suggest that long-lasting alterations in hippocampal astrocytes may be associated with these behavioral strategy shifts.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Recognition of a pathogen by the plant immune system often triggers a form of regulated cell death traditionally known as the hypersensitive response. This type of immune cell death occurs precisely at the site of pathogen recognition, and it is restricted to a few cells. Extensive research has shed light into how plant immune receptors are mechanistically activated. However, a central key question remains largely unresolved: how does cell death zonation take place and what are the mechanisms that underpin this phenomenon? As a consequence, bona fide transcriptional indicators of immune cell death are lacking, which prevents gaining a deeper insight of its mechanisms before cell death becomes macroscopic and precludes any early or live observation. We addressed this question using the paradigmatic Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae pathosystem, by performing a spatio-temporally resolved gene expression analysis that compared infected cells that will undergo immune cell death upon pathogen recognition vs by-stander cells that will stay alive and activate immunity. Our data revealed unique and time-dependent differences in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes, expression profiles and biological processes derived from tissue undergoing immune cell death and that of its surroundings. Further, we generated a pipeline based on concatenated pairwise comparisons between time, zone and treatment that enabled us to define 13 robust transcriptional immune cell death markers. Among these genes, the promoter of an uncharacterized AAA-ATPase has been used to obtain a fluorescent reporter transgenic line, which displays a strong spatio-temporally resolved signal specifically in cells that will later undergo pathogen-triggered cell death. In sum, this valuable set of genes can be used to define those cells that are destined to die upon infection with immune cell death-triggering bacteria, opening new avenues for specific and/or high-throughput techniques to study immune cell death processes at a single-cell level.",

However, habitat loss, pesticides, invasive species, and larger environmental fluctuations are contributing to a dramatic decline of numerous pollinators world-wide. This has increased the need for interventions to protect the composition, functioning, and dynamics of pollinator communities. Yet, how to make these interventions successful at the system level remains extremely challenging due to the complex nature of species interactions and the various unknown or unmeasured confounding ecological factors. Here, we propose that this knowledge can be derived by following a probabilistic causal analysis of pollinator communities. This analysis implies the inference of interventional expectations from the integration of observational and synthetic data. We propose that such synthetic data can be generated using theoretical models that can enable the tractability and scalability of unseen confounding ecological factors affecting the behavior of pollinator communities. We discuss a road map for how this probabilistic causal analysis can be accomplished to increase our system-level causative knowledge of natural communities.",

Among the complex pathways called by the viral infection autophagy is particularly crucial and is strongly influenced by the action of the non-structural protein 6 (Nsp6) interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Importantly, differently from other non-structural proteins Nsp6 is mutated in the recently emerged Omicron variant, suggesting a possible different role of autophagy. In this contribution we explore, for the first time, the structural property of Nsp6 thanks to long-time scale molecular dynamic simulations and machine learning analysis, identifying the interaction patterns with the lipid membrane. We also show how the mutation brought by the Omicron variant may indeed modify some of the specific interactions, and more particularly help anchoring the viral protein to the lipid bilayer interface.\n\nElectronic Supplementary Information (ESI) availableAnalysis protein of the secondary structure and of the specific lipid/amino acid interactions.

PINK1, a kinase, phosphorylates ubiquitin to recruit parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to mitochondria. PINK1 controls both parkin localization and activity through phosphorylation of both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of parkin. Here, we observe that phospho-ubiquitin can bind to two distinct sites on parkin, a high affinity site on RING1 that controls parkin localization, and a low affinity site on RING0 that releases parkin autoinhibition. Surprisingly, NMR titrations and ubiquitin vinyl sulfone assays show that the RING0 site has higher affinity for phospho-ubiquitin than the phosphorylated Ubl. Parkin could be activated by micromolar concentrations of tetra-phospho-ubiquitin chains that mimic a mitochondrion bearing multiple phosphorylated ubiquitins. A chimeric form of parkin with the Ubl domain replaced by ubiquitin was readily activated by PINK1 phosphorylation. In all cases, mutation of the binding site on RING0 abolished parkin activation. The feedforward mechanism of parkin activation confers robustness and rapidity to the PINK1-parkin pathway and likely represents an intermediate step in its evolutionary development.",

Characterizing the proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in COPD with advanced proteomic methods will identify disease-related changes, provide insight into pathogenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutics that will aid in the discovery of more effective therapeutics for COPD.\n\nObjectivesWe compared epithelial lining fluid proteome of ex-smokers with moderate COPD who are not in exacerbation status COPD, to non-smoking healthy control subjects using advanced proteomics methods and applied proteome-scale translational bioinformatics approaches to identify potential therapeutic protein targets and drugs that modulate these proteins towards the treatment of COPD.\n\nMethodsProteomic profiles of bronchalveolar lavage fluid were obtained from 1) never-smoker control subjects with normal lung function (n=10) or 2) individuals with stable moderate (GOLD stage 2, FEV1 50% - 80% predicted) COPD who were ex-smokers for at least one year (n=10). NIHs Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Ingenuitys Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were the two bioinformatics tools employed for network analysis on the differentially expressed proteins to identify potential crucial hub proteins. The drug-proteome interaction signature comparison and ranking approach implemented in the Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform for multiscale therapeutic discovery was utilized to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of COPD based on the BALF proteome. Subsequently, a literature-based knowledge graph was utilized to rank combinations of drugs that would most likely ameloriate inflammatory processes by inhibition or activation of their functions.\n\nResultsProteomic network analysis demonstrated that 233 of the >1800 proteins identified in the BALF were differentially expressed in COPD versus control, including proteins associated with inflammation, structural elements, and energy metabolism. Functional annotation of the differentially expressed proteins by their implicated biological processes, cellular localization, and transcription factor interactions was accomplished via DAVID. Canonical pathways containing the differential expressed proteins were detailed via the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis application. Topological network analysis demonstrated that four proteins act as central node proteins in the inflammatory pathways in COPD. The CANDO multiscale drug discovery platform was used to analyze the behavioral similarity between the interaction signatures of all FDA-approved drugs and the identified BALF proteins. The drugs with the signatures most similar interaction signatures to approved COPD drugs were extracted with the CANDO platform. The analysis revealed 189 drugs that putatively target the proteins implicated in COPD. The putative COPD drugs that were identified using CANDO were subsequently analyzed using a knowledge based technique to identify an optimal two drug combination that had the most appropriate effect on the central node proteins.\n\nConclusionAnalysis of the BALF proteome revealed novel differentially expressed proteins in the epithelial lining fluid that elucidate COPD pathogenesis. Network analyses identified critical targets that have critical roles in modulating COPD pathogenesis, for which we identified several drugs that could be repurposed to treat COPD using a multiscale shotgun drug discovery approach.",

At the mitochondrial level, protection promoted by CR in the brain and liver is related to higher calcium uptake rates and capacities, avoiding Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. Dietary restriction has also been shown to increase kidney resistance against damaging stimuli such as ischemia/reperfusion, but if these effects are related to similar mitochondrial adaptations had not yet been uncovered. Here, we characterized changes in mitochondrial function in response to six months of CR in rats, measuring bioenergetic parameters, redox balance and calcium homeostasis. CR promoted an increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates under non-phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions. While CR prevents mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in many tissues, in kidney we found that mitochondrial H2O2 release was enhanced, although levels of carbonylated proteins and methionine sulfoxide were unchanged. Surprisingly, and opposite to the effects observed in brain and liver, mitochondria from CR animals are more prone to Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. CR mitochondria also displayed higher calcium uptake rates, which were not accompanied by changes in calcium efflux rates, nor related to altered inner mitochondrial membrane potentials or the amounts of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Instead, increased mitochondrial calcium uptake rates in CR kidneys correlate with a loss of MICU2, an MCU modulator. Interestingly, MICU2 is also modulated by CR in liver, suggesting it has a broader diet-sensitive regulatory role controlling mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Together, our results highlight the organ-specific bioenergetic, redox, and ionic transport effects of CR. Specifically, we describe the regulation of the expression of MICU2 and its effects on mitochondrial calcium transport as a novel and interesting aspect of the metabolic responses to dietary interventions.",

Here, we describe a kinesin-1 KIF5C mutant with an increased ability to generate defects in the microtubule lattice as compared to the wild-type motor. Expression of the mutant motor in cultured cells resulted in microtubule breakage and fragmentation, suggesting that kinesin-1 variants with increased damage activity would have been selected against during evolution. The increased ability to damage microtubules is not due to the altered motility properties of the mutant motor as expression of the kinesin-3 motor KIF1A, which has similar single-motor motility properties, also caused increased microtubule pausing, bending, and buckling but not breakage. In cells, motor-induced microtubule breakage could not be prevented by increased a-tubulin K40 acetylation, a post-translational modification known to increase microtubule flexibility. In vitro, lattice damage induced by wild-type KIF5C was repaired by soluble tubulin and resulted in increased rescues and microtubule growth whereas lattice damage induced by the KIF5C mutant resulted in larger repair sites that made the microtubule vulnerable to breakage and fragmentation when under mechanical stress. These results demonstrate that kinesin-1 motility causes defects in and damage to the microtubule lattice in cells. While cells have the capacity to repair lattice damage, conditions that exceed this capacity result in microtubule breakage and fragmentation and may contribute to human disease.",

To reconstruct the role of NO in the animal stem lineage, we set out to study NO signaling in choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals12. In animals, NO produced by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) canonically signals through cGMP by activating soluble guanylate cyclases (sGCs)13,14. We surveyed the distribution of the NO signaling pathway components across the diversity of choanoflagellates and found three species that express NOS, sGCs, and downstream genes previously shown to be involved in the NO/cGMP pathway. One of these, Choanoeca flexa, forms multicellular sheets that undergo collective contractions controlled by cGMP15. We found that treatment with NO induces sustained contractions in C. flexa by signaling through an sGC/cGMP pathway. Biochemical assays show that NO directly binds C. flexa sGC1 and stimulates its cyclase activity. The NO/cGMP pathway acts independently from other inducers of C. flexa contraction, including mechanical stimuli and heat, but sGC activity is required for contractions induced by light-to-dark transitions. The output of NO signaling in C. flexa - contractions resulting in a switch from feeding to swimming - resembles the effect of NO in sponges1-3 and cnidarians11,16,17, where it interrupts feeding and activates contractility. These data provide insights into the biology of the first animals and the evolution of NO signaling.",

    "preprint_abstract": "We probe the interplay between intercellular interactions and pressure fluctuations associated with single cells in regulating cell proliferation using simulations of a minimal model for three-dimensional multicellular spheroid (MCS) growth. The emergent spatial variations in the cell division rate, that depends on the location of the cells within the MCS, is regulated by intercellular adhesion strength (fad). This in turn results in non-monotonic proliferation of cells in the MCS with varying adhesion strength, which accords well with experimental results. A biomechanical feedback mechanism coupling the fad and cell-dependent pressure fluctuations relative to a threshold value (pc) determines the onset of a dormant phase, and explains the non-monotonic proliferation response. Increasing fad from low values enhances cell proliferation because pressure on individual cells is smaller compared to pc. In contrast, at high fad, cells readily become dormant and cannot rearrange effectively, leading to arrested cell proliferation. Our work, which shows that proliferation is regulated by pressure-adhesion feedback loop, may be a general feature of tumor growth.",

To what extent the mechanism of the former resembles that of the latter is an open question. We report here structures of tubulin bound to the PN2-3 domain of CPAP, a protein controlling the length of the centrioles. We show that an -helix of the PN2-3 N-terminal region binds and caps the longitudinal surface of the tubulin {beta} subunit. Moreover, a PN2-3 N-terminal stretch lies in a {beta}-tubulin site also targeted by fungal and bacterial peptide-like inhibitors of the vinca domain, sharing a very similar binding mode with these compounds. Therefore, our results identify several characteristic features of cellular partners that bind to this site and highlight a structural convergence of CPAP with small molecule inhibitors of microtubule assembly.",

We investigated the relative effects of invasive predator control and habitat fragmentation on the abundance of native birds and invasive mammalian predators in native forest fragments.\n\nLocationWaikato region, New Zealand\n\nMethodsWe sampled invasive mammalian predator and native bird abundances using camera traps and bird counts at 26 sites in 15 forest fragments across New Zealands Waikato region. Fragment area, shape complexity, and surrounding land cover of exotic and native forest were determined in ArcMap. We further created two composite gradients reflecting predator control intensity and temporal distribution of control based on seven quantitative variables recorded in each of the five years preceding native bird data collection. Finally, we estimated the relative influence of these drivers on invasive mammals and functional groups of native birds using model averaging.\n\nResultsOf the two invasive predator control variables, only control intensity significantly affected invasive predator abundance and was also a more important driver than landscape or fragment structure, but responses varied among invasive mammal species. In contrast, both invasive predator control intensity and fragment structure were similarly important drivers of native bird abundance, though bird community responses varied markedly between functional groups.\n\nMain conclusionsOur findings suggest that spatial extent of invasive mammal control is important for controlling mammal numbers and enhancing bird abundance, especially for small insectivorous species, and that habitat fragmentation is less important for invasive mammals but at least as important for native bird communities. Consequently, both drivers should be given strong consideration when undertaking landscape-scale conservation and restoration of bird communities in human-altered landscapes threatened by invasive predators.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Neural oscillations are thought to play a central role in orchestrating activity states between distant neural populations. In humans, long-range neural connectivity has been particularly well characterised for 13-30 Hz beta activity which becomes phase coupled between the motor cortex and the contralateral muscle during isometric contraction. Based on this and related observations, beta activity and connectivity have been linked to sustaining stable cognitive and motor states - or the  status quo - in the brain. Recently, however, beta activity has been shown to be short-lived, as opposed to sustained - though so far this has been reported for regional beta activity in tasks without sustained motor demands. Here, we measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electromyography (EMG) in 18 human participants performing an isometric-contraction (gripping) task designed to yield sustained behavioural output. If cortico-muscular beta connectivity is directly responsible for sustaining a stable motor state, then beta activity should be (or become) sustained in this context. In contrast, we found that beta activity and connectivity with the downstream muscle were transient, even when participants engaged in sustained gripping. Moreover, we found that sustained motor requirements did not prolong beta-event duration in comparison to rest. These findings suggest that long-range neural synchronisation may entail short  bursts of frequency-specific connectivity, even when task demands - and behaviour - are sustained.\n\nHighlightsO_LITrial-average 13-30 Hz beta activity and connectivity with the muscle appear sustained during stable motor behaviour\nC_LIO_LISingle-trial beta activity and connectivity are short-lived, even when motor behaviour is sustained\nC_LIO_LISustained task demands do not prolong beta-event duration in comparison to resting state\nC_LI",

Two ethanol-responsive lncRNAs in yeast interact with cell cycle proteins, and here we investigated the role of these RNAs on the ethanol-stressed cell cycle. Our network dynamic modeling showed that the higher and lower ethanol tolerant strains undergo a cell cycle arrest during the ethanol stress. However, lower tolerant phenotype arrest in a later phase leading to its faster population rebound after the stress relief. Two lncRNAs can skip the arrests mentioned. The in silico overexpression of lnc9136 of SEY6210 (a lower tolerant strain), and CRISPR-Cas9 partial deletions of this lncRNA, evidenced that the one induces a regular cell cycle even under ethanol stress; this lncRNA binds to Gin4 and Hsl1, driving the Swe1p, Clb1/2, and cell cycle. Moreover, the lnc10883 of BY4742 (a higher tolerant strain) interacts to the Mec1p and represses Bub1p, circumventing the DNA and spindle damage checkpoints keeping a normal cell cycle even under DNA damage. Overall, we present the first evidence of the direct roles of lncRNAs on cell cycle proteins, the dynamics of this system in different ethanol tolerant phenotypes, and a new cell cycle model.",

However, the neural circuitry involved in food-based decisions is only recently being addressed. Given the relatively fast dynamics of decision formation, EEG-informed fMRI analysis is highly beneficial for localizing this circuitry in humans. Here by using the EEG correlates of evidence accumulation in a simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI dataset, we found a significant role for the right temporal-parietal operculum (PO) and medial insula including gustatory cortex (GC) in binary choice between food items. These activations were uncovered by using the \"EEG energy\" (power 2) as the BOLD regressor and were missed if conventional analysis with the EEG signal itself were to be used, in agreement with theoretical predictions for EEG and BOLD relations. No significant positive correlations were found with higher powers of EEG (powers 3 or 4) pointing to specificity and sufficiency of EEG energy as the main correlate of the BOLD response. This finding extends the role of cortical areas traditionally involved in palatability processing to value-based decision making and offers the \"EEG energy\" as a key regressor of BOLD response in simultaneous EEG-fMRI designs.",

Single cell genomics allows the generation of detailed cellular atlases in human tissues, but most efforts are focused on single tissue types. Here, we establish a framework for profiling multiple tissues across the human body at single-cell resolution using single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq), and apply it to 8 diverse, archived, frozen tissue types (three donors per tissue). We apply four snRNA-seq methods to each of 25 samples from 16 donors, generating a cross-tissue atlas of 209,126 nuclei profiles, and benchmark them vs. scRNA-seq of comparable fresh tissues. We use a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to integrate an atlas across tissues, donors, and laboratory methods. We highlight shared and tissue-specific features of tissue-resident immune cells, identifying tissue-restricted and non-restricted resident myeloid populations. These include a cross-tissue conserved dichotomy between LYVE1- and HLA class II-expressing macrophages, and the broad presence of LAM-like macrophages across healthy tissues that is also observed in disease. For rare, monogenic muscle diseases, we identify cell types that likely underlie the neuromuscular, metabolic, and immune components of these diseases, and biological processes involved in their pathology. For common complex diseases and traits analyzed by GWAS, we identify the cell types and gene modules that potentially underlie disease mechanisms. The experimental and analytical frameworks we describe will enable the generation of large-scale studies of how cellular and molecular processes vary across individuals and populations.",

Especially within citizen science, an emerging source of information filling the knowledge gaps needed to solve the biodiversity crisis, such tools can allow participants to recognize and report more poorly known species. This can be an important tool in addressing the substantial taxonomic bias in biodiversity data, where broadly recognized, charismatic species are highly overrepresented. Meanwhile, the recognition models are trained using the same biased data, so it is important to consider what additional images are needed to improve recognition models. In this study, we investigated how the amount of training data influenced the performance of species recognition models for various taxa. We utilized a large Citizen Science dataset collected in Norway, where images are added independently from identification. We demonstrate that while adding images of currently under-represented taxa will generally improve recognition models more, there are important deviations from this general pattern. Thus, a more focused prioritization of data collection beyond the basic paradigm that \"more is better\" is likely to significantly improve species recognition models and advance the representativeness of biodiversity data.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can infect mucosal tissues of the human body. To persist at the mucosal barrier, this highly adaptable pathogen has evolved many strategies, including invasion of host cells. Here, we show that the P. aeruginosa lectin LecB binds and cross-links fucosylated receptors at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. This triggers a signaling cascade via Src kinases and PI3K leading to the formation of patches enriched with the basolateral marker PIP3 at the apical plasma membrane. This identifies LecB as causative bacterial factor for activating this well-known host cell response that is elicited upon apical binding of P. aeruginosa. Downstream of PI3K, Rac1 is activated to cause actin rearrangement and the outgrowth of protrusions at the apical plasma membrane. LecB-triggered PI3K activation also results in aberrant recruitment of caveolin-1 to the apical domain. In addition, we reveal a positive feedback loop between PI3K activation and apical caveolin-1 recruitment, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed implication of caveolin-1 in P. aeruginosa host cell invasion. Interestingly, LecB treatment also reversibly removes primary cilia. To directly prove the role of LecB for bacterial uptake, we coated bacteria-sized beads with LecB, which drastically enhanced their endocytosis. Furthermore, LecB deletion and LecB inhibition with L-fucose diminished the invasion efficiency of P. aeruginosa bacteria. Taken together, our study identifies LecB as missing link that can explain how PI3K signaling and caveolin-1 recruitment are triggered to facilitate invasion of epithelial cells from the apical side by P. aeruginosa.\n\nImportanceAn intriguing feature of the bacterium P. aeruginosa is its ability to colonize highly diverse niches. P. aeruginosa can, besides biofilm formation, also enter and proliferate within epithelial host cells. Moreover, research during recent years has shown that P. aeruginosa possesses many different mechanisms to invade host cells. In this study we identify LecB as novel invasion factor. In particular, we show that LecB activates PI3K signaling, which is connected via a positive feedback loop to apical caveolin-1 recruitment, and leads to actin rearrangement at the apical plasma membrane. This provides a unifying explanation for the previously reported implication of PI3K and caveolin-1 in P. aeruginosa host cell invasion. In addition, our study adds a further function to the remarkable repertoire of the lectin LecB, which is all brought about by the capability of LecB to recognize fucosylated glycans on many different niche-specific host cell receptors.",

In this study, we investigated selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) utilizing multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in conjunction with custom oligonucleotides with an increased specificity for the T. pallidum genome, and the capture and removal of CpG-methylated host DNA using the NEBNext(R) Microbiome DNA Enrichment Kit followed by MDA with the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit as enrichment methods to improve the yields of T. pallidum DNA in isolates and lesion specimens from syphilis patients. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq v2 500 cycle or NovaSeq 6000 SP platform. These two enrichment methods led to 93-98% genome coverage at 5 reads/site in 5 clinical specimens from the United States and rabbit propagated isolates, containing >14 T. pallidum genomic copies/l of sample for SWGA and >129 genomic copies/l for CpG methylation capture with MDA. Variant analysis using sequencing data derived from SWGA-enriched specimens, showed that all 5 clinical strains had the A2058G mutation associated with azithromycin resistance. SWGA is a robust method that allows direct whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens containing very low numbers of T. pallidum, which have been challenging until now.\n\nImportanceSyphilis is a sexually transmitted, disseminated acute and chronic infection caused by the bacterial pathogen Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Primary syphilis typically presents as single or multiple mucocutaneous lesions, and if left untreated, can progress through multiple stages with varied clinical manifestations. Molecular studies often rely on direct amplification of DNA sequences from clinical specimens; however, this can be impacted by inadequate samples due to disease progression or timing of patients seeking clinical care. While genotyping has provided important data on circulating strains over the past two decades, WGS data is needed to better understand strain diversity, perform evolutionary tracing, and monitor antimicrobial resistance markers. The significance of our research is the development of a SWGA DNA enrichment method that expands the range of clinical specimens that can be directly sequenced to include samples with low numbers of T. pallidum.",

While the availability of public genomic data has become essential for modern life sciences research, the curation of the data is a growing area of concern that has significant real-world impacts on public health epidemiology, drug discovery, and environmental biosurveillance research1-6. While public microbial genome databases such as NCBIs RefSeq database leverage the scalability of crowd sourcing for growth, they do not require data provenance to the original biological source materials or accurate descriptions of how the data was produced7. Here, we describe the de novo assembly of 1,113 bacterial genome references produced from authenticated materials sourced from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), each with full data provenance. Over 98% of these ATCC Standard Reference Genomes (ASRGs) are superior to assemblies for comparable strains found in NCBIs RefSeq database. Comparative genomics analysis revealed significant issues in RefSeq bacterial genome assemblies related to genome completeness, mutations, structural differences, metadata errors, and gaps in traceability to the original biological source materials. For example, nearly half of RefSeq assemblies lack details on sample source information, sequencing technology, or bioinformatics methods. We suggest there is an intrinsic connection between the quality of genomic metadata, the traceability of the data, and the methods used to produce them with the quality of the resulting genome assemblies themselves. Our results highlight common problems with \" reference genomes\" and underscore the importance of data provenance for precision science and reproducibility. These gaps in metadata accuracy and data provenance represent an \" elephant in the room\" for microbial genomics research, but addressing these issues would require raising the level of accountability for data depositors and our own expectations of data quality.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Dickeya dadantii is a phytopathogenic bacterium that causes soft rot in a wide range of plant hosts worldwide, and a model organism for studying virulence gene regulation. The present study provides a comprehensive and annotated transcriptomic map of D. dadantii obtained by a computational method combining five independent transcriptomic datasets: (i) paired-end RNA-seq data for a precise re-construction of the RNA landscape; (ii) DNA microarray data providing transcriptional responses to a broad variety of environmental conditions; (iii) long-read Nanopore native RNA-seq data for isoform-level transcriptome validation and determination of transcription termination sites; (iv)dRNA-seq data forthe precise mapping of transcription start sites; (v) in planta DNA microarray data for a comparison of gene expression profiles between in vitro experiments and the early stages of plant infection. Our results show that transcription units sometimes coincide with predicted operons but are generally longer, most of them comprising internal promoters and terminators that generate alternative transcripts of variable gene composition. We characterise the occurrence of transcriptional read-through at terminators, which might play a basal regulation role and explain the extent of transcription beyond the scale of operons. We finally highlight the presence of noncontiguous operons and excludons in the D. dadantii genome, novel genomic arrangements that might contribute to the basal coordination of transcription. The highlighted transcriptional organisation may allow D. dadantii to finely adjust its gene expression programme for a rapid adaptation to fast changing environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis is the first transcriptomic map of a Dickeya species. It may therefore significantly contribute to further progress in the field of phytopathogenicity. It is also one of the first reported applications of long-read Nanopore native RNA-seq in prokaryotes. Our findings yield insights into basal rules of coordination of transcription that might be valid for other bacteria, and may raise interest in the field of microbiology in general. In particular, we demonstrate that gene expression is coordinated at the scale of transcription units rather than operons, which are larger functional genomic units capable of generating transcripts with variable gene composition for a fine-tuning of gene expression in response to environmental changes. In line with recent studies, our findings indicate that the canonical operon model is insufficient to explain the complexity of bacterial transcriptomes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BDNF has remarkable protective roles in the central nervous system to ensure neurons and glial cells survival and proper functions. The regulatory processes behind the BDNF expression have not been revealed completely. Here, it was explored whether Malat1 and Hotair lncRNAs play roles in the regulation of Bdnf expression level, modification of fingolimod downstream pathway, and oligodendrocytes precursor cells maturation. By Hotair and Malat1 downregulation, their regulatory mechanism on Bdnf expression was investigated. Immunostaining and RT-qPCR assays were employed to assess the effects of fingolimod and lncRNAs on OPCs maturation. The results represented that Hotair and Malat1 lncRNAs may regulate Bdnf expression in primary glial cells significantly, and also can coordinate fingolimod stimulatory effect on Bdnf expression. Furthermore, Malat1 may have a role in the last stages of the intrinsic oligodendrocyte myelination. Here it was demonstrated that these lncRNAs have critical roles in the Bdnf level, fingolimod mechanism of action, and OPCs maturation. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of neurotrophins leads to a better comprehension of the neurodegenerative disorders pathogenesis and designing more effective treatments.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting 1-2% of children. Studies have revealed genetic and cellular abnormalities in the brains of affected individuals, leading to both regional and distal cell communication deficits. Recent application of single cell technologies, especially single cell transcriptomics, has significantly expanded our understanding of brain cell heterogeneity and further demonstrated that multiple cell types and brain layers or regions are perturbed in autism. The underlying high-dimensional single cell data provides opportunities for multi-level computational analysis that collectively can better deconvolute the molecular and cellular events altered in autism. Here, we apply advanced computation and pattern recognition approaches on single cell RNA-seq data to infer and compare inter-cell-type signaling communications in autism brains and controls. Our results indicate that at a global level there are cell-cell communication differences in autism in comparison to controls, largely involving neurons as both signaling senders and receivers, but glia also contribute to the communication disruption. Although the magnitude of change is moderate, we find that excitatory and inhibitor neurons are involved in multiple intercellular signaling that exhibit increased strengths in autism, such as NRXN and CNTN signaling. Not all genes in the intercellular signaling pathways are differentially expressed, but genes in the pathways are enriched for axon guidance, synapse organization, neuron migration, and other critical cellular functions. Furthermore, those genes are highly connected to and enriched for genes previously associated with autism risks. Overall, our proof-of-principle computational study using single cell data uncovers key intercellular signaling pathways that are potentially disrupted in the autism brains, suggesting that more studies examining cross-cell type affects can be valuable for understanding autism pathogenesis.",

We observed that ywhaz expression was panneuronal during developmental stages and restricted to Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum, cells that are described to be reduced in number in autistic patients. We then performed whole-brain imaging in wild-type and ywhaz CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) larvae and found altered neuronal activity and connectivity in the hindbrain. Adult ywhaz KO fish display decreased levels of monoamines in the hindbrain and freeze when exposed to novel stimuli, a phenotype that can be reversed with drugs that target monoamine neurotransmission. These findings suggest an important role for ywhaz in establishing neuronal connectivity during development and modulating both neurotransmission and behaviour in adults.",

Here, we integrated kinetic investigations with structural studies to elucidate how the ubiquitous co-chaperonin prefoldin (PFD) inhibits diabetes associated islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibril formation. We demonstrated that both human and archaeal PFD interfere similarly with the IAPP fibril elongation and secondary nucleation pathways. Using archaeal prefoldin model, we combined NMR spectroscopy with EM to establish that the inhibition of fibril formation is mediated by the binding of prefoldins coiled-coil helices to the flexible IAPP N-terminal segment accessible on the fibril surface and fibril ends. AFM demonstrates that binding of prefoldin to IAPP leads to the formation of lower amounts of aggregates, composed of shorter fibrils, clustered together. Linking structural models with observed fibrillation inhibition processes opens new perspectives for understanding the interference between natural chaperones and formation of disease-associated amyloids.",

However, it is currently unknown whether self-identification impacts grid cells and spatial navigation. Integrating the online manipulation of bodily signals, to modulate self-identification, into a spatial navigation task and with an fMRI measure to detect grid cell-like representation (GCLR) in humans, we report improved spatial navigation performance and decreased GCLR in EC when participants navigated with enhanced self-identification. These changes were further associated with increased activity in posterior parietal and retrosplenial cortex. Modulating self-identification by controlling online body-derived signals during spatial navigation, these data link the sense of self to spatial navigation and to entorhinal grid cell-like activity within a distributed cortical spatial navigation system.",

Considering the numerous homologous genes across the human and mouse genomes, misalignment errors should be evaluated, and a new algorithm is required. We assessed the extents and effects of misalignment errors when using human and mouse combined reference data and developed a new bioinformatics pipeline with expression-based species deconvolution to minimize errors. We also evaluated false-positive signals for a species presumed to originate from ambient RNA of the other species and applied a computational method to remove them. Misaligned reads account for an average of 0.5% of total reads, but such reads were concentrated to few genes that were greatly affected. Human and mouse mixed single-cell data, analyzed using our pipeline, clustered well with unmixed data and showed higher k-nearest-neighbor batch effect test and Local Inverse Simpsons Index scores than those derived from Cell Ranger. We also applied our pipeline to multispecies multisample single-cell library containing breast cancer xenograft tissue and successfully identified all samples using genomic array and expression. Moreover, diverse cell types in the tumor microenvironment were well captured. We present our bioinformatics pipeline for mixed human and mouse single-cell data, which can also be applied to pooled libraries to obtain cost-effective single-cell data.

    "preprint_abstract": "Extreme Antarctic conditions provide one of the closest analogues of extraterrestrial environments. Since air and snow samples, especially from polar regions, yield DNA amounts in the lower picogram range, binning of prokaryotic genomes is challenging and renders studying the dispersal of biological entities across these environments difficult. Here, we hypothesized that dispersal of host-associated bacteriophages (adsorbed, replicating or prophages) across the Antarctic continent can be tracked via their genetic signatures aiding our understanding of virus and host dispersal across long distances. Phage genome fragments (PGFs) reconstructed from surface snow metagenomes of three Antarctic stations were assigned to four host genomes, mainly Betaproteobacteria including Ralstonia spp. We reconstructed the complete genome of a temperate phage with near-complete alignment to a prophage in the reference genome of Ralstonia pickettii 12D. PGFs from different stations were related to each other at the genus level and matched similar hosts. Metagenomic read mapping and nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed a wide dispersal of highly identical PGFs, 13 of which were detected in seawater from the Western Antarctic Peninsula in distance of 5538 km to the snow sampling stations. Our results suggest that host-associated phages, especially of Ralstonia sp., disperse over long distances despite harsh conditions of the Antarctic continent. Given that 14 phages associated with two R. pickettii draft genomes isolated from space equipment were identified, we conclude that Ralstonia phages are ideal mobile genetic elements to track dispersal and contamination in ecosystems relevant for Astrobiology.\n\nImportanceHost-associated phages of the bacterium Ralstonia identified in snow samples can be used to track microbial dispersal over thousands of kilometers across the Antarctic continent, which functions as an extraterrestrial analogue because of its harsh environmental conditions. Due to presence of these bacteria carrying genome-integrated prophages on space-related equipment, and the here demonstrated potential for dispersal of host-associated phages, our work has implications for Planetary Protection, a discipline in Astrobiology interested in preventing contamination of celestial bodies with alien biomolecules or forms of life.",

Because waterbird movements are difficult to quantify, determining the host-specific risk of Eurasian-origin AI movements into North America is challenging. We estimated relative rates of movements, based on long-term evolutionary averages of gene flow, between Eurasian and North American waterbird populations to obtain bidirectional baseline rates of the intercontinental movements of these AI hosts. We used population genomics and coalescent-based demographic models to obtain these gene-flow-based movement estimates. Inferred rates of movement between these populations varies greatly among species. Within dabbling ducks, gene flow, relative to effective population size, varies from [~]3-24 individuals/generation between Eurasian and American wigeons (Mareca penelope - M. americana) to [~]100-300 individuals/generation between continental populations of northern pintails (Anas acuta). These are evolutionary long-term averages and provide a solid foundation for understanding the relative risks of each of these host species in potential intercontinental AI movements. We scale these values to census size for evaluation in that context. In addition to being AI hosts, many of these species are also important in the subsistence diets of Alaskans, increasing the risk of direct bird-to-human exposure to Eurasian-origin AI virus. We contrast species-specific rates of intercontinental movements with the importance of each species in Alaskan diets to understand the relative risk of these taxa to humans. Greater scaup (Aythya marila), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and northern pintail (Anas acuta) were the top three species presenting the highest risks for intercontinental AI movement both within the natural system and through exposure to subsistence hunters. These directly comparable, species-based intercontinental movement rates and relative risk rankings should help in modeling, monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of intercontinental host and AI movements.",

Acute TBI treatments are needed that protect against axon damage and promote recovery of axon function to prevent long term symptoms and neurodegeneration. Our prior characterization of axon damage and demyelination after TBI led us to examine repurposing of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), an FDA-approved inhibitor of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. 4-AP is currently indicated to provide symptomatic relief for patients with chronic stage multiple sclerosis, which involves axon damage and demyelination. We tested clinically relevant dosage of 4-AP as an acute treatment for experimental TBI and found multiple benefits in corpus callosum axons. This randomized, controlled pre-clinical study focused on the first week after TBI, when axons are particularly vulnerable. 4-AP treatment initiated one day post-injury dramatically reduced axon damage detected by intra-axonal fluorescence accumulations in Thy1-YFP mice of both sexes. Detailed electron microscopy in C57BL/6 mice showed that 4-AP reduced pathological features of mitochondrial swelling, cytoskeletal disruption, and demyelination. Furthermore, 4-AP improved the molecular organization of axon nodal regions by restoring disrupted paranode domains and reducing Kv1.2 channel dispersion. 4-AP treatment did not resolve deficits in action potential conduction across the corpus callosum, based on ex vivo electrophysiological recordings at 7 days post-TBI. Thus, this first study of repurposing 4-AP as an acute treatment for TBI demonstrates pre-clinical efficacy in decreasing pathological hallmarks of axon damage. Studies beyond this acute phase are now warranted to assess functional utility and outcome trajectory.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is an acute injury that, if unresolved, can progress to cause persistent, debilitating symptoms. Currently, no treatments effectively prevent damage to long myelinated axons in white matter tracts, which is a hallmark pathology of TBI. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) is FDA-approved to treat chronic symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis, which involves autoimmune damage to myelinated axons. As the first assessment of repurposing 4-AP as an acute treatment for TBI, our randomized, controlled studies tested the hypothesis that low-dose 4-AP initiated one day after experimental TBI will reduce acute axon damage and demyelination. We found that 4-AP treatment significantly reduced the progression of axon pathology and demyelination during the first week after TBI using clinically relevant experimental conditions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Although it is known that RNA undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), the interplay between the molecular driving forces and the emergent features of the condensates, such as their morphologies and dynamical properties, is not well understood. We introduce a coarse-grained model to simulate phase separation of trinucleotide repeat RNAs, which are implicated in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. After establishing that the simulations reproduce key experimental findings (length and concentration dependence of the phase transition in (CAG)n repeats), we show that once recruited inside the liquid droplets, the monomers transition from hairpin-like structures to extended states. Interactions between the monomers in the condensates result in the formation of an intricate and dense intermolecular network, which severely restrains the fluctuations and mobilities of the RNAs inside large droplets. In the largest densely packed high viscosity droplets, the mobility of RNA chains is best characterized by reptation, reminiscent of the dynamics in polymer melts. Our work provides a microscopic framework for understanding liquid-liquid phase separation in RNA, which is not easily discernible in current experiments.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The world is rapidly urbanising, inviting mounting concern that urban environments will experience increased zoonotic disease risk. Urban animals could have more frequent contact with humans, and therefore may transmit more zoonotic parasites; however, these animals have a specific set of underlying traits that may determine their parasite burdens while predisposing them to urban living, and they may be subject to more intense research effort, both of which could complicate our ability to reliably identify the role of urbanisation in driving zoonotic risk. Here, we test whether urban mammal species host more known zoonotic parasites, investigating the potential underlying drivers while accounting for a correlated suite of phenotypic, taxonomic, and geographic predictors. We found that urban-adapted mammals have more documented parasites, and more zoonotic parasites specifically: despite comprising only 157 of the 2792 investigated species (6%), urban mammals provided 39% of known host-parasite combinations and showed consistently higher viral discovery rates throughout the last century. However, contrary to predictions, much of the observed effect was attributable to research effort rather than to urban adaptation status itself, and urban-adapted species in fact hosted fewer zoonoses than expected given their total observed parasite richness. We conclude that extended historical contact with humans has had a limited impact on the number of observed zoonotic parasites in urban-adapted mammals; instead, their greater observed zoonotic richness likely reflects sampling bias arising from proximity to humans, which supports a near-universal underlying pattern of conflation between zoonotic risk, research effort, and synanthropy. These findings underscore the need to resolve the ecological mechanisms underlying links between anthropogenic change, sampling bias, and observed wildlife disease dynamics.",

Here, we introduce Nuclear protein Epitope, chromatin Accessibility, and Transcriptome sequencing (NEAT-seq), a technique to simultaneously measure nuclear protein abundance, chromatin accessibility, and the transcriptome in single cells. We apply this technique to profile CD4 memory T cells using a panel of master transcription factors (TFs) that drive distinct helper T cell subsets and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and identify examples of TFs with regulatory activity gated by three distinct mechanisms: transcription, translation, and regulation of chromatin binding. Furthermore, we identify regulatory elements and target genes associated with each TF, which we use to link a non-coding GWAS SNP within a GATA motif to both strong allele-specific chromatin accessibility in cells expressing high levels of GATA3 protein, and a putative target gene.",

However, RNA structural determination is difficult. Herein, we present a nanoarchitectural strategy to enable the efficient single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of RNA-only structures. This strategy, termed RNA oligomerization-enabled cryo-EM via installing kissing-loops (ROCK), involves the engineering of target RNAs by installing kissing-loop sequences onto functionally nonessential stems for the assembly into closed homomeric nanoarchitectures. Assembly with geometric restraints leads to (1) molecular weight multiplication and (2) structural flexibility mitigation, both beneficial for cryo-EM analysis. Together with construct optimization and symmetry-expansion reconstruction, ROCK yields the cryo-EM reconstruction of the Tetrahymena group I intron at an overall resolution of 2.98 [A] (2.85 [A] resolution for the core domains), enabling the de novo model building of the complete intron RNA including previously unknown peripheral domains. When applied to smaller RNAs, ROCK readily produces modest-resolution maps, revealing the conformational rearrangement of the Azoarcus group I intron and the bound ligand in the FMN riboswitch. Our work unleashes the largely unexplored potential of cryo-EM in RNA structural studies.",

STRIFE takes as input Fragment Hotspot Maps (FHMs) extracted from a protein target, and processes them to provide meaningful and interpretable structural information to its generative model, which in turn is able to rapidly generate elaborations with complementary pharmacophores to the protein. In a large-scale evaluation, STRIFE outperforms existing, structure-unaware, fragment elaboration methods in proposing highly ligand efficient elaborations.

Prior studies of the MpzSer63del mouse model of CMT1B have demonstrated that protein misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) contributed to the neuropathy. Heterozygous patients with an arginine to cysteine mutation in MPZ (MPZR98C) develop a severe infantile form of CMT1B which is modeled by MpzR98C/+ mice that also show ER-stress and an activated UPR. C3-PMP22 mice are considered to effectively model CMT1A. Altered proteostasis, ER-stress and activation of the UPR have been demonstrated in mice carrying Pmp22 mutations. To determine whether enabling the ER-stress/UPR and readjusting protein homeostasis would effectively treat these models of CMT1B and CMT1A we administered Sephin1/IFB-088/icerguestat, a UPR modulator which showed efficacy in the MpzS63del model of CMT1B, to heterozygous MpzR98C and C3-PMP22 mice. Mice were analyzed by behavioral, neurophysiological, morphological and biochemical measures. Both MpzR98C/+ and C3-PMP22 mice improved in motor function and neurophysiology. Myelination, as demonstrated by g-ratios and myelin thickness, improved in CMT1B and CMT1A mice and markers of UPR activation returned towards wild type values. Taken together our results demonstrate the capability of IFB-088 to treat a second mouse model of CMT1B and a mouse model of CMT1A, the most common form of CMT. Given the recent benefits of IFB-088 treatment in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis animal models, these data demonstrate its potential in managing UPR and ER-stress for multiple mutations in CMT1 as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus) is an important subsistence species for Alaskas Arctic Indigenous communities, yet little is known about life history diversity, migration patterns, and freshwater habitat use. Using laser ablation Sr isotope otolith microchemistry, we analyzed Colville River Broad Whitefish 87Sr/86Sr chronologies (n = 61) to reconstruct movements and habitat use across the lives of individual fish. We found evidence of at least six life history types, including three anadromous types, one semi-anadromous type, and two nonanadromous types. Anadromous life history types comprised a large proportion of individuals sampled (collectively, 59%) and most of these (59%) migrated to sea between ages 0-2 and spent varying durations at sea. The semi-anadromous life history type comprised 28% of samples and entered marine habitat as larvae. Nonanadromous life history types comprised the remainder (collectively, 13%). Otolith 87Sr/86Sr data from juvenile and adult freshwater stages suggest that habitat use changed in association with age, seasons, and life history strategies. This information on Broad Whitefish life histories and habitat use across time and space will help managers and conservation planners better understand the risks of anthropogenic impacts and help conserve this vital subsistence resource.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Identifying structural differences among proteins can be a non-trivial task. When contrasting ensembles of protein structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, biologically-relevant features can be easily overshadowed by spurious fluctuations. Here, we present SINATRA Pro, a computational pipeline designed to robustly identify topological differences between two sets of protein structures. Algorithmically, SINATRA Pro works by first taking in the 3D atomic coordinates for each protein snapshot and summarizing them according to their underlying topology. Statistically significant topological features are then projected back onto a user-selected representative protein structure, thus facilitating the visual identification of biophysical signatures of different protein ensembles. We assess the ability of SINATRA Pro to detect minute conformational changes in five independent protein systems of varying complexities. In all test cases, SINATRA Pro identifies known structural features that have been validated by previous experimental and computational studies, as well as novel features that are also likely to be biologically-relevant according to the literature. These results highlight SINATRA Pro as a promising method for facilitating the non-trivial task of pattern recognition in trajectories resulting from molecular dynamics simulations, with substantially increased resolution.\n\nAuthor SummaryStructural features of proteins often serve as signatures of their biological function and molecular binding activity. Elucidating these structural features is essential for a full understanding of underlying biophysical mechanisms. While there are existing methods aimed at identifying structural differences between protein variants, such methods do not have the capability to jointly infer both geometric and dynamic changes, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose SINATRA Pro, a computational framework for extracting key structural features between two sets of proteins. SINATRA Pro robustly outperforms standard techniques in pinpointing the physical locations of both static and dynamic signatures across various types of protein ensembles, and it does so with improved resolution.",

However, the mechanisms induced by the parasite that regulate the development of metabolic diseases in the host are unclear. The present study aimed to verify the influence of Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection in early stages of high fat diet-induced obesity.\n\nPrincipal FindingsThe presence of infection was able to prevent exacerbated weight gain in mice fed with high fat diet when compared to non-infected controls. In addition, infected animals displayed improved insulin sensitivity and decreased fat accumulation in the liver. Obesity-associated inflammation was reduced in the presence of infection, demonstrated by higher levels of IL10 and adiponectin, increased infiltration of Th2 and eosinophils in adipose tissue of infected animals. Of note, the parasite infection was associated with increased Treg frequency in adipose tissue which showed higher expression of cell surface markers of function and activation, like LAP and CD134. The infection could also revert the loss of function in Tregs associated with high fat diet.\n\nConclusionThese data suggest that H. polygyrus infection can prevent weight gain and metabolic syndrome in animals fed with high fat diet associated with modulations of adipose tissue Treg cells.\n\nAuthor summaryHelminth infections are known to modulate the immune system being responsible for protecting the host from developing allergic and autoimmune disorders (Hygiene Hypothesis). We hypothesized that the same immunomodulatory effect can have an impact on immunometabolic diseases, such as obesity and its linked diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Weight disorders have reached epidemic levels, nearly tripling since 1975 and being responsible for almost 5 million premature deaths each year. To test our hypothesis C57BL/6 male mice were fed control or high fat diet, for five weeks, in the presence or not of Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection. Weight gain, development of metabolic disorders, inflammation and cellular migration to the adipose tissue were evaluated. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that the presence of infection prevented the exacerbated weight gain and also improved metabolic parameters in animals fed a high fat diet. This was associated with the infections ability to modulate parameters of a cell responsible for regulatory functions: Tregs. In the light of these findings, helminth infection could be protective against weight gain and metabolic disturbances.",

Here, we dissect the regulation of the posterior Hox genes nob-1 and php-3 in the nematode C. elegans. We show that nob-1 and php-3 are co-expressed in gastrulation-stage embryos in cells that previously expressed the anterior Hox gene ceh-13. This expression is controlled by several partially redundant transcriptional enhancers. These enhancers require ceh-13 for expression, providing a striking example of an anterior Hox gene positively regulating a posterior Hox gene. Several other regulators also act positively through nob-1/php-3 enhancers, including elt-1/GATA, ceh-20/ceh-40/Pbx, unc-62/Meis, pop-1/TCF, ceh-36/Otx and unc-30/Pitx. We identified defects in both cell position and cell division patterns in ceh-13 and nob-1;php-3 mutants, suggesting that these factors regulate lineage identity in addition to positional identity. Together, our results highlight the complexity and flexibility of Hox gene regulation and function and the ability of developmental transcription factors to regulate different targets in different stages of development.\n\nAuthor SummaryHox genes are critical for head-to-tail patterning during embryonic development in all animals. Here we examine the factors that are necessary to turn on two posterior Hox genes, nob-1 and php-3, in the nematode worm, C. elegans. We identified six new transcription factors and three enhancer regions of DNA that can activate expression of nob-1/php-3. Unexpectedly, these activating transcription factors included ceh-13, an anterior Hox gene, and elt-1, a regulator of skin development that is briefly expressed in many cells that do not adopt skin fates, including the cells that express nob-1. Furthermore, the cellular defects we observed in ceh-13 and nob- 1;php-3 mutant embryos indicate that the early embryonic functions of these Hox genes help determine the identity of cells as well as their position within the embryo. Our findings identify new roles for Hox genes in C. elegans and emphasize the ability of transcription factors to contribute to the diversification of cell types and the adoption of specific cell types at different phases of embryonic development.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The availability of pathogen sequence data and use of genomic surveillance is rapidly increasing. Genomic tools and classification systems need updating to reflect this. Here, rabies virus is used as an example to showcase the potential value of updated genomic tools to enhance surveillance to better understand epidemiological dynamics and improve disease control. Previous studies have described the evolutionary history of rabies virus; however, the resulting taxonomy lacks the definition necessary to identify incursions, lineage turnover and transmission routes at high resolution. Here we propose a lineage classification system based on the dynamic nomenclature used for SARS-CoV-2, defining a lineage by phylogenetic methods, for tracking virus spread and comparing sequences across geographic areas. We demonstrate this system through application to the globally distributed Cosmopolitan clade of rabies virus, defining 73 total lineages within the clade, beyond the 22 previously reported. We further show how integration of this tool with a new rabies virus sequence data resource (RABV-GLUE) enables rapid application, for example, highlighting lineage dynamics relevant to control and elimination programmes, such as identifying importations and their sources, and areas of persistence and transmission, including transboundary incursions. This system and the tools developed should be useful for coordinating and targeting control programmes and monitoring progress as we work towards eliminating dog-mediated rabies, as well as having potential for broad application to the surveillance of other viruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe importance of the ability to track the diversity and spread of viruses in a universal way that can be clearly communicated has been highlighted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This, accompanied with the increase in the availability and use of pathogen sequence data, means the development of new genomic tools and classification systems can strengthen outbreak response and disease control. Here, we present an easy-to-use objective and transferable classification tool for tracking viruses at high resolution. We use rabies virus, a neglected zoonotic disease that causes around 59,000 human deaths each year, as an example use case of this tool. Applying our tool to a global clade of rabies virus, we find an over 200% increase in the definition at which we can classify the virus, allowing us to identify areas of persistence and transmission that were not previously apparent, and patterns of virus spread. Insights from the application of this tool should prove valuable in targeting vaccination campaigns and improving surveillance as countries work towards the elimination of dog-mediated rabies.",

In this study, we characterized the major PTEN from E. histolytica, EhPTEN1, which shows the highest expression at the transcript level in the trophozoite stage among 6 possible PTENs, to understand the significance of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling in this parasite. Live imaging of GFP-EhPTEN1 expressing amebic trophozoites showed localization mainly in the cytosol with a higher concentration at pseudopods and the extending edge of the phago- and trogocytic cups. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of phago- and trogocytosis using a confocal image cytometer showed that overexpression of EhPTEN1 caused reduction in trogo- and phagocytosis while transcriptional gene silencing of EhPTEN1 gene caused opposite phenotypes. These data suggest that EhPTEN1 has an inhibitory role in these biological processes. Conversely, EhPTEN1 acts as a positive regulator for fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis in E. histolytica trophozoites. Moreover, we showed that EhPTEN1 was required for optimal growth and migration of this parasite. Finally, the phosphatase activity of EhPTEN1 towards PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was demonstrated, suggesting that the biological roles of EhPTEN1 are likely linked to its catalytic function. Taken together, these results indicate that EhPTEN1 differentially regulates multiple cellular activities essential for proliferation and pathogenesis of the organism, via PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling. Elucidation of biological roles of PTEN and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling at the molecular levels promotes our understanding of the pathogenesis of this parasite and potentially leads to the design of novel therapeutics against amebiasis.\n\nAuthor summaryEntamoeba histolytica is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscesses in humans. It has been well understood how the amoebas ability to ingests and destroy human cells and invade tissues contributes to disease symptoms such as bloody diarrhea. The underlying mechanisms for such activities, called pathogenicity, include trafficking (transport) and secretion of cytolytic proteins, migration (ameboid movement), and ingestion and destruction of human cells, heavily rely on the signal transduction system via metabolism (synthesis and decomposition) of phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositols containing 0-5 phosphates), and downstream regulation of cytoskeleton (dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments, such as actin, in the cytoplasm). In this study, we characterized one enzyme called EhPTEN1, which degrades and inactivate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We have shown that EhPTEN1 is involved in migration, internalization of soluble and solid materials (endocytosis, trogo-, and phagocytosis). EhPTEN1 apparently regulates cell migration, endocytosis, trogo-, phagocytosis, and proliferation in a complex fashion. Our findings help in the elucidation of the physiological significance of PTEN and cellular events regulated via phosphoinositides in this enteric parasite and other pathogenic parasites, and potentially lead to the development of new control measures against parasitic diseases.",

Deletion of the complex has wide-ranging consequences including ER stress, disturbance in lipid transport and organelle tethering, among others. Here we report the function and organization of the evolutionarily conserved EMC (TbEMC) in the highly diverged eukaryote, Trypanosoma brucei. Using (co-) immunoprecipitation experiments in combination with mass spectrometry and whole cell proteomic analyses of parasites after depletion of select TbEMC subunits, we demonstrate that the TbEMC is composed of 9 subunits that are present in a high molecular mass complex localizing to the mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum interface. Knocking out or knocking down of single TbEMC subunits led to growth defects of T. brucei procyclic forms in culture. Interestingly, we found that depletion of individual TbEMC subunits lead to disruption of de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the two most abundant phospholipid classes in T. brucei. Downregulation of TbEMC1 or TbEMC3 inhibited formation of PC while depletion of TbEMC8 inhibited PE synthesis, pointing to a role of the TbEMC in phospholipid synthesis. In addition, we found that in TbEMC7 knock-out parasites, TbEMC3 is released from the complex, implying that TbEMC7 is essential for the formation or the maintenance of the TbEMC.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Growing cells adopt common basic strategies to achieve optimal resource allocation under limited resource availability. Our current understanding of such \"growth laws\" neglects degradation, assuming that it occurs slowly compared to the cell cycle duration. Here we argue that this assumption cannot hold at slow growth, leading to important consequences. We propose a simple framework showing that at slow growth protein degradation is balanced by a fraction of \"maintenance\" ribosomes. Consequently, active ribosomes do not drop to zero at vanishing growth, but as growth rate diminishes, an increasing fraction of active ribosomes performs maintenance. Through a detailed analysis of compiled data, we show that the predictions of this model agree with data from E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Intriguingly, we also find that protein degradation increases at slow growth, which we interpret as a consequence of active waste management and/or recycling. Our results highlight protein turnover as an underrated factor for our understanding of growth laws across kingdoms.\n\nAuthor summaryThe idea that simple quantitative relationships relate cell physiology to cellular composition dates back to the 1950s, but the recent years saw a leap in our understanding of such \"growth laws\", with relevant implications regarding the interdependence between growth, metabolism and biochemical networks. However, recent works on nutrient-limited growth mainly focused on laboratory conditions that are favourable to growth. Thus, our current mathematical understanding of the growth laws neglects protein degradation, under the argument that it occurs slowly compared to the timescale of the cell cycle. Instead, at slow growth the timescales of mass loss from protein degradation and dilution become comparable. In this work, we propose that protein degradation shapes the quantitative relationships between ribosome allocation and growth rate, and determines a fraction of ribosomes that do not contribute to growth and need to remain active to balance degradation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Working memory is a core component of critical cognitive functions such as planning and decision-making. Persistent activity that lasts long after the stimulus offset has been considered a neural substrate for working memory. Attractor dynamics based on network interactions can successfully reproduce such persistent activity. However, it suffers from a fine-tuning of network connectivity, in particular, to form continuous attractors suggested for working memory encoding analog signals. Here, we investigate whether a specific form of synaptic plasticity rules can mitigate such tuning problems in two representative working memory models, namely, rate-coded and location-coded persistent activity. We consider two prominent types of plasticity rules, differential plasticity targeting the slip of instant neural activity and homeostatic plasticity regularizing the long-term average of activity, both of which have been proposed to fine-tune the weights in an unsupervised manner. Consistent with the findings of previous works, differential plasticity alone was enough to recover a graded-level persistent activity with less sensitivity to learning parameters. However, for the maintenance of spatially structured persistent activity, differential plasticity could recover persistent activity, but its pattern can be irregular for different stimulus locations. On the other hand, homeostatic plasticity shows a robust recovery of smooth spatial patterns under particular types of synaptic perturbations, such as perturbations in incoming synapses onto the entire or local populations, while it was not effective against perturbations in outgoing synapses from local populations. Instead, combining it with differential plasticity recovers location-coded persistent activity for a broader range of perturbations, suggesting compensation between two plasticity rules.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhile external error and reward signals are essential for supervised and reinforcement learning, they are not always available. For example, when an animal holds a piece of information in mind for a short delay period in the absence of the original stimulus, it cannot generate an error signal by comparing its memory representation with the stimulus. Thus, it might be helpful to utilize an internal signal to guide learning. Here, we investigate the role of unsupervised learning for working memory maintenance, which acts during the delay period without external inputs. We consider two prominent classes of learning rules, namely, differential plasticity, which targets the slip of instant neural activity, and homeostatic plasticity, which regularizes the long-term average of activity. The two learning rules have been proposed to fine-tune the synaptic weights without external teaching signals. Here, by comparing their performance under various types of network perturbations, we reveal the conditions under which each rule can be effective and suggest possible synergy between them.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Like many viruses, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) has a high nutation rate, which helps the virus adapt quickly, but mutations come with fitness costs. Fitness costs can be studied by different approaches, such as experimental or frequency-based approaches. The frequency-based approach is particularly useful to estimate in vivo fitness costs, but this approach works best with deep sequencing data from many hosts, are. In this study, we applied the frequency-based approach to a large dataset of 195 patients and estimated the fitness costs of mutations at 7957 sites along the HCV genome. We used beta regression and random forest models to better understand how different factors influenced fitness costs. Our results revealed that costs of nonsynonymous mutations were three times higher than those of synonymous mutations, and mutations at nucleotides A or T had higher costs than those at C or G. Genome location had a modest effect, with lower costs for mutations in HVR1 and higher costs for mutations in Core and NS5B. Resistance mutations were, on average, costlier than other mutations. Our results show that in vivo fitness costs of mutations can be virus specific, reinforcing the utility of constructing in vivo fitness cost maps of viral genomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding how viruses evolve within patients is important for combatting viral diseases, yet studying viruses within patients is difficult. Laboratory experiments are often used to understand the evolution of viruses, in place of assessing the evolution in natural populations (patients), but the dynamics will be different. In this study, we aimed to understand the within-patient evolution of Hepatitis C virus, which is an RNA virus that replicates and mutates extremely quickly, by taking advantage of high-throughput next generation sequencing. Here, we describe the evolutionary patterns of Hepatitis C virus from 195 patients: We analyzed mutation frequencies and estimated how costly each mutation was. We also assessed what factors made a mutation more costly, including the costs associated with drug resistance mutations. We were able to create a genome-wide fitness map of within-patient mutations in Hepatitis C virus which proves that, with technological advances, we can deepen our understanding of within-patient viral evolution, which can contribute to develop better treatments and vaccines.",

Previous work has explored the developmental sensory-driven activation of the primary sensory cortex processing whisker information (wS1), also called barrel cortex. This body of work has shown that the barrel cortex is already activated by sensory stimuli during the first post-natal week. However, it is currently unknown when over the course of development these stimuli begin being processed by higher order cortical areas, such as secondary whisker somatosensory area (wS2). Here we investigate for the first time the developmental engagement of wS2 by sensory stimuli and the emergence of cortico-cortical communication from wS1 to wS2. Using in vivo wide-field imaging and electrophysiological recordings in control and conditional knock-out mice we find that wS1 and wS2 are able to process bottom-up information coming from the thalamus already right after birth. We identify that it is only at the end of the first post-natal week that wS1 begins to provide excitation into wS2, a connection which begins to acquire feed-forward inhibition characteristics after the second post-natal week. Therefore, we have uncovered a developmental window during which excitatory versus inhibitory functional connectivity between wS1 and wS2 takes place.",

In case of early visual deprivation, hMT+/V5 enhances its response to moving sounds. Whether hMT+/V5 contains information about motion directions and whether the functional enhancement observed in the blind is motion specific, or also involves sound source location, remains unsolved. Moreover, the impact of this crossmodal reorganization of hMT+/V5 on the regions typically supporting auditory motion processing, like the human Planum Temporale (hPT), remains equivocal. We used a combined functional and diffusion MRI approach and individual in-ear recordings to study the impact of early blindness on the brain networks supporting spatial hearing, in male and female humans. Whole-brain univariate analysis revealed that the anterior portion of hMT+/V5 responded to moving sounds in sighted and blind people, while the posterior portion was selective to moving sounds only in blind participants. Multivariate decoding analysis revealed that the presence of motion directions and sound positions information was higher in hMT+/V5 and lower in hPT in the blind group. While both groups showed axis-of-motion organization in hMT+/V5 and hPT, this organization was reduced in the hPT of blind people. Diffusion MRI revealed that the strength of hMT+/V5 - hPT connectivity did not differ between groups, whereas the microstructure of the connections was altered by blindness. Our results suggest that the axis-of-motion organization of hMT+/V5 does not depend on visual experience, but that blindness alters the response properties of occipito-temporal networks supporting spatial hearing in the sighted.\n\nSignificance StatementSpatial hearing helps living organisms navigate their environment. This is certainly even more true in people born blind. How does blindness affect the brain network supporting auditory motion and sound source location? Our results show that the presence of motion directions and sound positions information was higher in hMT+/V5 and lower in hPT in blind relative to sighted people; and that this functional reorganization is accompanied by microstructural (but not macrostructural) alterations in their connections. These findings suggest that blindness alters crossmodal responses between connected areas that share the same computational goals.",

Evidence from neural recordings in animals point towards the existence of both head-centered and world-centered representations of sound location in the brain; however, it is unclear whether such neural representations have perceptual correlates in the sound localization abilities of non-human listeners. Here, we establish novel behavioral tests to determine the coordinate systems in which ferrets can localize sounds. We found that ferrets could learn to discriminate between sound locations that were fixed in either world-centered or head-centered space, across wide variations in sound location in the alternative coordinate system. Using probe sounds to assess broader generalization of spatial hearing, we demonstrated that in both head and world-centered tasks, animals used continuous maps of auditory space to guide behavior. Single trial responses of individual animals were sufficiently informative that we could then model sound localization using speaker position in specific coordinate systems and accurately predict ferrets actions in held-out data. Our results indicate that an animal model in which neurons are known to be tuned to sound location in egocentric and allocentric reference frames can also localize sounds in multiple head and world-centered spaces.\n\nSignificance StatementHumans can describe the location of sounds either relative to themselves, or in the world, independent of their momentary position. These different spaces are also represented in the activity of neurons in animals, but its not clear whether non-human listeners also perceive both head and world-centered sound location. Here, we designed two behavioral tasks in which ferrets had to discriminate between two sounds using their position in the world, or relative to the head. Subjects learnt to solve both problems and showed the ability to generalize sound location in each space when presented with infrequent probe sounds. These findings reveal a perceptual correlate of neural sensitivity previously observed in the ferret brain and establish that, like humans, ferrets can access an auditory map of their local environment.",

Here we examine the neural correlates of conflict and evidence integration during sequential decision making. Patients implanted with deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes and age-matched healthy controls performed an expanded judgement task, in which they were free to choose how many cues to sample. Behaviourally, we found that while patients sampled numerically more cues, they were less able to integrate evidence and showed suboptimal performance. Using recordings of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potentials (LFP, in patients) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), we found that beta oscillations signalled conflict between cues within a sequence. Following cues that differed from previous cues, beta power in the STN and cortex first decreased and then increased. Importantly, the conflict signal in the STN outlasted the cortical one, carrying over to the next cue in the sequence. Furthermore, after a conflict, there was an increase in coherence between the dorsal premotor cortex and subthalamic nucleus in the beta band. These results extend our understanding of cortico-subcortical dynamics of conflict processing, and do so in a context where evidence must be accumulated in discrete steps, much like in real life.

    "preprint_abstract": "Emotion recognition abilities are fundamental to our everyday social interaction. A large number of clinical populations show impairments in this domain, with emotion recognition atypicalities being particularly prevalent among disorders exhibiting a dopamine system disruption (e.g., Parkinsons disease). Although this suggests a role for dopamine in emotion recognition, studies employing dopamine manipulation in healthy volunteers have exhibited mixed neural findings and no behavioural modulation. Interestingly, whilst a dependence of dopaminergic drug effects on individual baseline dopamine function has been well established in other cognitive domains, the emotion recognition literature so far has failed to account for these possible interindividual differences. The present within-subjects study therefore tested the effects of the dopamine D2 antagonist haloperidol on emotion recognition from dynamic, whole-body stimuli while accounting for interindividual differences in baseline dopamine. 33 healthy male and female adults rated emotional point-light walkers (PLWs) once after ingestion of 2.5 mg haloperidol and once after placebo. To evaluate potential mechanistic pathways of the dopaminergic modulation of emotion recognition, participants also performed motoric and counting-based indices of temporal processing. Confirming our hypotheses, effects of haloperidol on emotion recognition depended on baseline dopamine function, where individuals with low baseline dopamine showed enhanced, and those with high baseline dopamine decreased emotion recognition. Drug effects on emotion recognition were related to drug effects on movement-based and explicit timing mechanisms, indicating possible mediating effects of temporal processing. Results highlight the need for future studies to account for baseline dopamine and suggest putative mechanisms underlying the dopaminergic modulation of emotion recognition.\n\nSignificance statementA high prevalence of emotion recognition difficulties amongst clinical conditions where the dopamine system is affected suggests an involvement of dopamine in emotion recognition processes. However, previous psychopharmacological studies seeking to confirm this role in healthy volunteers thus far have failed to establish whether dopamine affects emotion recognition and lack mechanistic insights. The present study uncovered effects of dopamine on emotion recognition in healthy individuals by controlling for interindividual differences in baseline dopamine function and investigated potential mechanistic pathways via which dopamine may modulate emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that dopamine may influence emotion recognition via its effects on temporal processing, providing new directions for future research on typical and atypical emotion recognition.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Response inhibition is a primary executive control function that allows the withholding of inappropriate responses, and requires appropriate perception of the external environment to achieve a behavioral goal. It remains unclear, however, how response inhibition is achieved when goal-relevant information involves perceptual uncertainty. Twenty-six human participants of both sexes performed a go/no-go task where visually presented random-dot motion stimuli involved perceptual uncertainties. The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) was involved in response inhibition, and the middle temporal (MT) region showed greater activity when dot motions involved less uncertainty. A neocortical temporal region in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) specifically showed greater activity during response inhibition in more perceptually certain trials. In this STS region, activity was greater when response inhibition was successful than when it failed. Directional effective connectivity analysis revealed that in more coherent trials, the MT and STS regions showed enhanced connectivity to the rIFC, whereas in less coherent trials, the signal direction was reversed. These results suggest that a reversible fronto-temporal functional network guides response inhibition under perceptual uncertainty, and in this network, perceptual information in the MT is converted to control information in the rIFC via STS, enabling achievement of response inhibition.\n\nSignificance statementResponse inhibition refers to withholding inappropriate behavior and is an important for achieving goals. Often, however, decision must be made based on limited environmental evidence. We showed that successful response inhibition is guided by a neocortical temporal region that plays a hub role in converting perceived information coded in a posterior temporal region to control information coded in the prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, when a perceived stimulus becomes more uncertain, the prefrontal cortex supplements stimulus encoding in the temporal regions. Our results highlight fronto-temporal mechanisms of response inhibition in which conversion of stimulus-control information is regulated based on the uncertainty of environmental evidence.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Calcium imaging using GCaMP indicators and miniature microscopes has been used to image cellular populations during long timescales and in different task phases, as well as to determine neuronal circuit topology and organization. Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes over time during these tasks. All reported HPC in vivo calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice. In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) in vivo calcium imaging from CA1 hippocampus in freely moving male rats. Using the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that, in rat, hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks. We show that calcium events in these cells are highly correlated with periods of movement, with few calcium events occurring during periods without movement. We additionally show that an extremely large percent of cells recorded during a navigational task are place cells (77.3{+/-}5.0%, surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging), and that these cells enable accurate decoding of animal position and can be held over days with consistent place fields in a consistent spatial map. A detailed protocol is included, and implications of these advancements on in vivo imaging and place field literature are discussed.\n\nSignificance statementIn vivo calcium imaging in freely moving animals allows the visualization of cellular activity across days. In this paper, we present the first in vivo Ca2+ recording from CA1 hippocampus in freely moving rats. We demonstrate that hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks, and that calcium activity corresponds to periods of movement. We show that a high percentage (77.3{+/-}5.0%) of imaged cells are place cells, and that these place cells enable accurate decoding and can be held stably over days with little change in field location. Because the hippocampus is essential for many tasks involving memory, navigation, and learning, imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can shed new insight on cellular activity changes and organization.",

IgE-mediated crosslinking of the Fc{varepsilon}RI receptors causes mast cell activation and contributes to disease pathogenesis. The mast cell lineage is one of the least studied among the hematopoietic cell lineages and there are still controversies about the identity of the mast cell progenitor, i.e., whether Fc{varepsilon}RI expression appears during the hematopoietic progenitor stage or in maturing mast cells. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to reveal a temporal association between the appearance of Fc{varepsilon}RI and the mast cell gene signature in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In agreement with these data, the Fc{varepsilon}RI+ hematopoietic progenitors formed morphologically, phenotypically and functionally mature mast cells in long-term culture assays. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis further revealed the expression patterns of prospective cytokine receptors regulating mast cell progenitor development. Culture assays showed that IL-3 and IL-5 promoted disparate effects on progenitor cell proliferation and survival, respectively, whereas IL-33 caused robust Fc{varepsilon}RI downregulation. Taken together, we have demonstrated that Fc{varepsilon}RI appears during the hematopoietic progenitor stage of mast cell differentiation and that external stimuli may regulate the Fc{varepsilon}RI expression. Thus, the results resolve the controversy regarding the appearance of Fc{varepsilon}RI during mast cell development.\n\nOne-sentence summarySingle-cell analysis of human hematopoiesis uncovers the stage at which Fc{varepsilon}RI appears during mast cell differentiation and reveals disparate effects of IL-3, IL-5 and IL-33 on mast cell progenitor proliferation, survival, and suppression of Fc{varepsilon}RI expression.",

Here we develop an unsupervised non-parametric clustering approach, which does not rely on predefined non-recombinant genomes, by adapting a community detection method developed for dynamic social network analysis. We show that this method (DSBM) attains a significantly lower mean error rate in detecting recombinant breakpoints in simulated data (quasibinomial GLM, P < 8 x 10-8), compared to other reference-free recombination detection programs (GARD, RDP4 and RDP5). Applied to a representative sample of n = 525 actual HIV-1 genomes, we determined k = 25 as the optimal number of DSBM clusters, and used change point detection to estimate that at least 95% of these genomes are recombinant. Further, we identified both known and novel recombination hotspots in the HIV-1 genome, and evidence of inter-subtype recombination in HIV-1 subtype reference genomes. We propose that clusters generated by DSBM can provide an informative new framework for HIV-1 classification.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Budbreak is one of the most observed and studied phenological phases in perennial plants. Two dimensions of exposure to temperature are generally used to model budbreak: accumulation of time spent at low temperatures (chilling); and accumulation of heat units (forcing). These two effects have a well-established negative correlation: the more chilling, the less forcing required for budbreak. Furthermore, temperate plant species are assumed to vary in amount of chilling required to complete endodormancy and begin the transition to breaking bud. Still, prediction of budbreak remains a challenge. The present work demonstrates across a wide range of species how bud cold hardiness must be accounted for to study dormancy and accurately predict time to budbreak. Cold hardiness defines the path length to budbreak, meaning the difference between the cold hardiness buds attain during the winter, and the cold hardiness at which deacclimated buds are predicted to open. This distance varies among species and throughout winter within a species. Increases in rate of cold hardiness loss (deacclimation) measured throughout winter show that chilling controls deacclimation potential - the proportion of the maximum rate response attained at high chill accumulation - which has a sigmoid relationship to chilling accumulation. For forcing, rates of deacclimation increase non-linearly in response to temperature. Comparisons of deacclimation potential show a dormancy progresses similarly for all species. This observation suggests that comparisons of physiologic and genetic control of dormancy requires an understanding of cold hardiness dynamics and the necessity for an update of the framework for studying dormancy and its effects on spring phenology.",

Although they are known to share a common evolutionary origin with neurons, the developmental program that promoted the emergence of cnidocyte fate is not known. Using functional genomics in the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, we show that cnidocytes evolved by suppression of neural fate in a subset of neurons expressing RFamide. We further show that a single regulatory gene, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor (ZNF845), coordinates both the gain of novel (cnidocyte-specific) traits and the inhibition of ancestral (neural) traits during cnidocyte development and that this gene arose by domain shuffling in the stem cnidarian. Thus, we uncover a mechanism by which a truly novel regulatory gene (ZNF845) promoted the origin of a truly novel cell type (cnidocyte) through duplication of an ancestral cell lineage (neuron) and inhibition of its ancestral identity (RFamide).\n\nSignificanceIn this study, we demonstrate how new cell types can arise in animals through duplication of an ancestral (old) cell type followed by functional divergence of the new daughter cell. Specifically, we show that stinging cells in cnidarians (jellyfish and corals) evolved by duplication of an ancestral neuron followed by inhibition of the RFamide neuropeptide it once secreted. This is the first evidence that stinging cells evolved from a specific subtype of neurons and suggests some neurons may be easier to co-opt for novel functions than others.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is highly effective in alleviating movement disability in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD). However, its therapeutic mechanism of action is unknown. The healthy striatum exhibits rich dynamics resulting from an interaction of beta, gamma and theta oscillations. These rhythms are at the heart of selection, initiation and execution of motor programs, and their loss or exaggeration due to dopamine (DA) depletion in PD is a major source of the behavioral deficits observed in PD patients. Interrupting abnormal rhythms and restoring the interaction of rhythms as observed in the healthy striatum may then be instrumental in the therapeutic action of DBS. We develop a biophysical networked model of a BG pathway to study how abnormal beta oscillations can emerge throughout the BG in PD, and how DBS can restore normal beta, gamma and theta striatal rhythms. Our model incorporates STN projections to the striatum, long known but understudied, that were recently shown to preferentially target fast spiking interneurons (FSI) in the striatum. We find that DBS in STN is able to normalize striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) activity by recruiting FSI dynamics, and restoring the inhibitory potency of FSIs observed in normal condition. We also find that DBS allows the re-expression of gamma and theta rhythms, thought to be dependent on high DA levels and thus lost in PD, through cortical noise control. Our study shows how BG connectivity can amplify beta oscillations, and delineates the role of DBS in disrupting beta oscillations and providing corrective input to STN efferents to restore healthy striatal dynamics. It also suggests how gamma oscillations can be leveraged to enhance or supplement DBS treatment and improve its effectiveness.",

The method leverages an entirely random gRNA library and SpCas9-NG to randomly damage genomes in a controllable shotgun-like manner that then triggers diverse and abundant mutations via low-fidelity repair. As a proof-of-principle, CARM was applied to evolve the capacity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 to produce {beta}-carotene. After seven rounds of iterative evolution over two months, a {beta}-carotene hyper-producing strain, C7-143, was isolated with a 10.5-fold increase in {beta}-carotene production and 857 diverse genomic mutants that comprised indels, duplications, inversions, and chromosomal rearrangements. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression of 2,541 genes of strain C7-143 were significantly altered, suggesting that the metabolic landscape of the strain was deeply reconstructed. In addition, CARM was applied to evolve the industrially relevant Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1C, the S-adenosyl-L-methionine production of which was increased to 2.28 times after just one round. Thus, CARM is a user-friendly and practical strategy for genetic remodeling and reverse engineering to investigate complicated organismal metabolism.",

Four treatments were designed offering shrimp farming wastes at 0, 33, 66, and 100%. The 4 % of feed respecting the total biomass of each experimental tank was offered daily. The total feed ratio was completed with commercial feed for marine fish in the treatments where it was needed. At the end of the feeding trial, final weight, weight gain, relative weight gain, and thermal growth coefficient were reduced in the fish when increasing the amount of SFW as feed. However, the fish showed a digestive capacity to use residual nutrients up to 66 %, increasing their initial weight by up to 25 %. The increase of shrimp farming waste as feed negatively affected the whole-body proximal composition. The digestibility results showed that the fish could digest up to 41 % of the shrimp farming waste protein. Results suggest that juvenile grey mullets are capable of utilizing residual nutrients from shrimp farming waste. However, it is necessary to use an alternative feed source to induce an optimal growth performance for the juvenile grey mullets. It is also recommended that mullets be fed with formulated feed to meet their nutritional requirements to maintain the protein and lipid content of the whole-body under culture conditions.",

While mass spectrometry has become an important, technique for diagnostics of infectious disease, there is a need for mass spectrometry workflows offering this capability. To meet this need, we have augmented the previously published Microorganism Classification and Identification (MiCId) workflow for this capability. To evaluate the performance of the newly augmented MiCId workflow, we have used MS/MS datafiles from samples of 10 antibiotic resistance bacterial strains belonging to three different species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The evaluation results show that MiCIds workflow has a sensitivity value around 85% (with a lower bound at about 72%) and a precision greater than 95% in the identification of antibiotic resistance proteins. Using MS/MS datasets from samples of two bacterial clonal isolates, one being antibiotic-sensitive while the other (obtained from the same patient at different times) being multidrug-resistant, we applied MiCIds workflow to investigate possible mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in these pathogenic bacteria; the results showed that MiCIds conclusions are in agreement with the published study. Furthermore, we show that MiCIds workflow is fast. It pro-vides microorganismal identifications, protein identifications, sample biomass estimates, and antibiotic resistance protein identifications in 6-17 minutes per MS/MS sample using computing resources that are available in most desktop and laptop computers, making it a highly portable workflow. This study demonstrated that MiCIds workflow is fast, portable, and with high sensitivity and high precision, making it a valuable tool for rapid identifications of bacteria as well as detection of their antibiotic resistance proteins.

It plays an important role in viral infection and immune escape by not only cleaving the viral polyprotein ORF1ab at 11 sites, but also cleaving the host proteins. However, there is still a lack of effective tools for determining the cleavage sites of the 3CL protease. This study systematically investigated the diversity of the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease on the viral polyprotein, and found that the cleavage motif were highly conserved for viruses in the genera of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. Strong residue preferences were observed at the neighboring positions of the cleavage sites. A random forest (RF) model was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the representation of residues at cleavage site and neighboring positions by amino acid indexes, and the model achieved an AUC of 0.96 in cross-validations. The RF model was further tested on an independent test dataset composed of cleavage sites on host proteins, and achieved an AUC of 0.88 and a prediction precision of 0.80 when considering the accessibility of the cleavage site. Then, 1,079 human proteins were predicted to be cleaved by the 3CL protease by the RF model. These proteins were enriched in pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases and pathogen infection. Finally, a user-friendly online server named 3CLP was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the RF model. Overall, the study not only provides an effective tool for identifying the cleavage sites of the 3CL protease, but also provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of coronaviruses.",

A key tactic is to correlate observed locations with environmental features, in the form of resource selection functions or other correlative species distribution models. In reality, however, the distribution of any population both affects and is affected by those surrounding it, creating a complex network of feedbacks causing emergent spatio-temporal features that may not correlate with any particular aspect of the underlying environment. Here, we study the way in which the movements of populations in response to one another can affect the spatio-temporal distributions of ecosystems. We construct a stochastic individual-based modelling (IBM) framework, based on stigmergent interactions (i.e. organisms leave marks which cause others to alter their movements) between and within populations. We show how to gain insight into this IBM via mathematical analysis of a partial differential equation (PDE) system given by a continuum limit. We show how the combination of stochastic simulations of the IBM and mathematical analysis of PDEs can be used to categorise emergent patterns into homogeneous vs. heterogeneous, stationary vs. perpetually-fluctuating, and aggregation vs. segregation. In doing so, we develop techniques for understanding spatial bifurcations in stochastic IBMs, grounded in mathematical analysis. Finally, we demonstrate through a simple example how the interplay between environmental features and between-population stigmergent interactions can give rise to predicted spatial distributions that are quite different to those predicted purely by accounting for environmental covariates.",

Pollinator abundances increased until 22% of impervious surface, dropping by 34% after that, and it also decreased with green patch distance and urban park size. Thus, suburban landscapes host more pollinators than highly cemented or seminatural areas. Moreover, pollinators diminished by up to 45% in areas with low temperature seasonality: urbanized areas likely posing thermic stress. Furthermore, the sugar mass available in nectar increased by 91% with impervious cover, indicating that city nectars were less consumed or flowers more productive. Furthermore, the species richness of pollen decreased by 32% in highly urbanized areas, and with a high incidence of exotic plants, hinting for anthropized plant communities.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. Urbanization influences pollinator abundances, nectar resources and transported pollen. Pollinators are negatively affected by a thermally harsh climate in highly urbanized areas with isolated green areas and large parks. Suburban landscapes demonstrated the highest pollinator presence. In the city core, flowers contained more nectary sugar, while pollinators collected pollen from a small number of plants, mainly exotic. These findings highlight the influence of urban landscape structure and climate on pollinators and plants, showing that cities are heterogenous realities. Patterns from this study will serve as basis for pollinator-friendly planning and management of urban landscapes.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Concerns have been raised as to whether the consumption of foodstuffs contaminated with pesticides can contribute to the development of chronic human diseases by affecting microbial community function in the gut. We provide the first associations between urinary pesticide excretion and the composition and function of the faecal microbiome in 65 twin pairs in the UK. Biomonitoring of exposure to 186 common insecticide, herbicide, or fungicide residues showed the presence of pyrethroid and/or organophosphorus insecticide residues in all urine samples, while the herbicide glyphosate was found in 45% of individuals. Other pesticides such as DEET, imidacloprid or dithiocarbamate fungicides were less frequently detected. While the geographic location or the rural/urban environment had no influence on pesticide urinary excretion, food frequency questionnaires showed that DMTP levels, a metabolite of organophosphates, was higher with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. Multivariable association between urinary pesticide excretion and faecal microbial composition and function were determined with shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics. A total of 34 associations between pesticide residues concentrations and faecal metabolite concentrations were detected. Glyphosate excretion was positively associated to an increased bacterial species richness, as well as to fatty acid metabolites and phosphate levels. The insecticide metabolite Br2CA, reflecting deltamethrin exposure, was positively associated with the mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol and enterolactone, and negatively associated with some N-methyl amino acids. Urine metabolomics performed on a subset of samples did not reveal associations with the excretion of pesticide residues. Our results highlight the need for future interventional studies to understand effects of pesticide exposure on the gut microbiome and possible health consequences.",

The transcriptional co-regulator RIP140 represses the activity of transcription factors that drive cell proliferation and metabolism and plays a role in mammary tumorigenesis. Here we use cell proliferation and metabolic assays to demonstrate that RIP140-deficiency causes a glycolysis-dependent increase in breast tumor growth. We further demonstrate that RIP140 reduces the transcription of the glucose transporter GLUT3 gene, by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of hypoxia inducible factor HIF-2 in cooperation with p53. Interestingly, RIP140 expression was significantly associated with good prognosis only for breast cancer patients with tumors expressing low GLUT3, low HIF-2 and high p53, thus confirming the mechanism of RIP140 anti-tumor activity provided by our experimental data. Overall, our work establishes RIP140 as a critical modulator of the p53/HIF cross-talk to inhibit breast cancer cell glycolysis and proliferation.",

Measuring these context-dependent effects in hosts and symbionts is critical to determining the nature of symbiotic interactions. We investigated context-dependence in the symbiosis between social amoeba hosts and their inedible Paraburkholderia bacterial symbionts, where the context is the abundance of host food bacteria. Paraburkholderia have been shown to harm hosts dispersed to food-rich environments, but aid hosts dispersed to food-poor environments by allowing hosts to carry food bacteria. Through measuring symbiont density and host spore production, we show that this food context matters in three other ways. First, it matters for symbionts, who suffer a greater cost from competition with food bacteria in the food-rich context. Second, it matters for host-symbiont conflict, changing how symbiont density negatively impacts host spore production. Third, data-based simulations show that symbiosis often provides a long-term fitness advantage for hosts after rounds of growth and dispersal in variable food-contexts, especially when conditions are harsh with little food. These results show how food context can have many consequences for the Dictyostelium-Paraburkholderia symbiosis and that both sides can frequently benefit.\n\nImpact StatementMany organisms form symbiotic relationships with other species. These symbioses often exhibit context-dependence, where the sign or magnitude of one partners effect on the other will change in different environments. Context-dependent effects make it difficult to assign interactions to categories like mutualisms or antagonisms because they involve both benefits and costs depending on the environment. However, in some cases, accounting for context-dependence can clarify an interaction so that it more easily fits a mutualism or antagonism. We investigated context-dependence using the symbiosis between Dictyostelium discoideum and two symbiotic Paraburkholderia species. In this symbiosis, Paraburkholderia bacteria allow hosts to carry food bacteria to food-poor contexts, where hosts rarely survive without food, but reduce host fitness in the more hospitable food-rich contexts. The effect of food context on Paraburkholderia symbionts is unknown. We show that Paraburkholderia symbionts are also affected by this context, through facing reduced competition after being dispersed by hosts to food-poor contexts. We also identify a new way that symbionts affect hosts, where symbiont density reduces host fitness, but less so in food-poor contexts. Finally, we use simulations to show that infected hosts benefit in the long-term across variable food contexts, especially in the harshest environments with little food. These results show that context-dependence in symbiosis can have many consequences for hosts and symbionts, though in general for D. discoideum and Paraburkholderia, both are likely to benefit.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Approximately 100,000 mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) events of HIV via human milk feeding occur each year (1). However, only about 15% of infants milk-fed by untreated HIV+ mothers become infected, suggesting a protective effect of the milk itself (1, 2). Infants ingest 105-108 maternal leukocytes daily via milk, which remain functional beyond ingestion (3-9). Such function may be elicited by maternal milk antibody (Ab). Though IgA is dominant in milk, most HIV-specific milk Abs are of the IgG subclass, highlighting the importance of investigating the function of each IgG isotype in the milk context (10-16). Though Ab effector function mediated by the constant (Fc) domain via interaction with Fc Receptors (FcRs), such as Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), are critical in protecting against HIV infection, ADCP is largely unexplored as it relates to mitigation of MTCT (17-21). Presently we report the ADCP activity of milk leukocytes against HIV particles and immune complexes (ICs), using 57 unique samples from 34 women, elicited by IgG1/2/3/4 of monoclonal (m)Ab 246-D. Granulocyte ADCP of HIV was most potent compared to other phagocytes when elicited by IgG1/3/4. IgG1/3 activated granulocytes similarly, exhibiting 1.6x-4.4x greater activity compared to IgG2/4, and a preference for virus compared to ICs. Notably, CD16-monocyte ADCP of a given target were unaffected by isotype, and CD16+ monocytes were poorly stimulated by IgG1. IgG2/4 elicited potent IC ADCP, and in terms of total leukocyte IC ADCP, IgG4 and IgG3 exhibited similar function, with IgG4 eliciting 1.6x-2.1x greater activity compared to IgG1/IgG2, and CD16+ monocytes most stimulated by IgG2. These data contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Fc-mediated functionality of milk leukocytes, which is critical in order to develop therapeutic approaches to eliminating this route of MTCT, including mucosal administration of mAbs and/or a maternal vaccination aimed to elicit a potent milk Ab response.",

However, 15N labeling quantification has several challenges. Less identifications are often observed in the heavy labeled samples because of incomplete labeling, resulting in missing values in reciprocal labeling experiments. Inaccurate quantification can happen when there is contamination from co-eluting peptides or chemical noise in the MS1 survey scan. These drawbacks in quantification can be more pronounced in less abundant but biologically interesting proteins, which often have very few identified peptides. Here we demonstrate the application of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to 15N labeled samples on a high resolution, high mass accuracy Orbitrap mass spectrometer to achieve reliable quantification even of low abundance proteins in samples.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundGenus Rickettsia (Alphaproteobacteria: Rickettsiales) encompasses numerous obligate intracellular species with predominantly ciliate and arthropod hosts. Notable species are pathogens transmitted to mammals by blood-feeding arthropods. Mammalian pathogenicity evolved from basal, non-pathogenic host-associations; however, some non-pathogens are closely related to pathogens. One such species, Rickettsia buchneri, is prevalent in the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. While I. scapularis transmits several pathogens to humans, it does not transmit Rickettsia pathogens. We hypothesize that R. buchneri established a mutualism with I. scapularis, blocking tick superinfection with Rickettsia pathogens.\n\nMethodsTo improve estimates for assessing R. buchneri infection frequency in blacklegged tick populations, we used comparative genomics to identify an R. buchneri gene (REIS_1424) not present in other Rickettsia species present throughout the I. scapularis geographic range. Bioinformatic and phylogenomics approaches were employed to propose a function for the hypothetical protein (263 aa) encoded by REIS_1424.\n\nResultsREIS_1424 has few analogs in other Rickettsiales genomes and greatest similarity to non-Proteobacteria proteins. This cohort of proteins varies greatly in size and domain composition, possessing characteristics of Recombination hotspot (Rhs) and contact dependent growth inhibition (CDI) toxins, with similarity limited to proximal C-termini ([~]145 aa). This domain was named CDI-like/Rhs-like CT toxin (CRCT). As such proteins are often found as toxin-antidote (TA) modules, we interrogated REIS_1423 (151 aa) as a putative antidote. Indeed, REIS_1423 is similar to proteins encoded upstream of CRCT domain-containing proteins. Accordingly, we named these proteins CDI-like/Rhs-like C-terminal toxin antidotes (CRCA). R. buchneri expressed both REIS_1423 and REIS_1424 in tick cell culture, and PCR assays showed specificity for R. buchneri over other rickettsiae and utility for positive detection in three tick populations. Finally, phylogenomics analyses uncovered divergent CRCT/CRCA modules in varying states of conservation; however, only R. buchneri and related Tamurae/Ixodes Group rickettsiae carry complete TA modules.\n\nConclusionWe hypothesize that Rickettsia CRCT/CRCA modules circulate in the Rickettsia mobile gene pool, arming rickettsiae for battle over arthropod colonization. While its functional significance remains to be tested, R. buchneri CRCT/CRCA serves as a marker to positively identify infection and begin deciphering the role this endosymbiont plays in the biology of the blacklegged tick.",

We also show unique characteristics absent in RSV infection or yellow fever vaccine samples: EBOV survivors show unprecedented high levels of class switching events while COVID-19 repertoires from acute disease appear underdeveloped. Despite the high levels of clonal expansion in COVID-19 IgG1 repertoires there is a striking lack of evidence of germinal centre mutation and selection. Given the differences in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality with age, it is also pertinent that we find significant differences in repertoire characteristics between young and old patients.

This has been accomplished, at least in part, through the activation of microglial cells; however, their response to the SUS treatment is only incompletely understood.\n\nMethodsWild-type (WT) and APP23 mice were subjected to SUS+MB, using non-SUS+MB-treated mice as sham controls. After 48 hours, the APP23 mice were injected with methoxy-XO4 to label A{beta} aggregates, followed by microglial isolation into XO4+ and XO4- populations using flow cytometry. Both XO4+ and XO4- cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and their transcriptome was analyzed through a bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nResultsThe transcriptomic analysis of the microglial cells revealed a clear segregation depending on genotype (AD model versus WT mice), as well as treatment (SUS+MB versus sham) and A{beta} internalization (XO4+ versus XO4- microglia). Differential gene expression analysis detected 278 genes that were significantly changed by SUS+MB in the XO4+ cells (248 up/30 down) and 242 in XO- cells (225 up/17 down). Not surprisingly given previous findings of increased phagocytosis of plaques following SUS+MB, the pathway analysis highlighted that the treatment induced an enrichment in genes related to the phagosome pathway in XO4+ microglia; however, when comparing SUS+MB to sham, the analysis revealed an enrichment in genes involved in the cell cycle in both the XO4+ and XO4- microglial population.\n\nConclusionOur data provide a comprehensive analysis of microglia in an AD mouse model subjected to ultrasound treatment as a function of A{beta} internalization, one of the defining hallmarks of AD. Several differentially expressed genes are highlighted, pointing to an ultrasound-induced activation of cell cycle mechanisms in microglial cells isolated from APP23 mice treated with SUS+MB.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473590v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ae94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a48d22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2dcb9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92dfb2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Currently, several vaccines are available, and multitudes of antiviral treatments have been proposed and tested. Although many of the vaccines show high clinical efficacy, they are not equally accessible worldwide. Additionally, due to the continuous emergence of new virus variants, and generally short duration of immunity, the development of safe and effective antiviral treatments remains of the utmost importance. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, substantial efforts have been undertaken to repurpose existing and approved drugs for accelerated clinical testing and potential emergency use authorizations. However, drug-repurposing using high throughput screenings in cellular assays, often identify hits that later prove ineffective in clinical studies. Our approach was to evaluate the activity of compounds that have either been tested clinically or already undergone extensive preclinical profiling, using a standardized in vitro model of human nasal epithelium. Secondly, we evaluated drug combinations using sub-maximal doses of each active single compound. Here, we report the antiviral effects of 95 single compounds and 30 combinations. The data show that selected drug combinations including 10 M of molnupiravir, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.

However, the instability of single emulsion (SE) drops occasionally causes significant merging during drop processing, limiting most applications to single-step reactions in drops. Here, we show that double emulsion (DE) drops address this critical limitation and completely prevent content mixing, which is essential for single entity analysis. DEs show excellent stability during thermal cycling. More importantly, DEs undergo rupture into the continuous phase instead of merging, preventing content mixing and eliminating unstable drops from the downstream analysis. Due to the lack of drop merging, the monodispersity of drops is maintained throughout a workflow, enabling the deterministic manipulation of drops downstream. We also developed a simple, one-layer fabrication method for DE drop makers. This design is powerful as it allows robust production of single-core DEs at a wide range of flow rates and better control over the shell thickness, both of which have been significant limitations of conventional two-layer devices. This approach makes the fabrication of DE devices much more accessible, facilitating its broader adoption. Finally, we show that DE droplets effectively maintain the compartmentalization of single virus genomes during PCR-based amplification and barcoding, while SEs mixed contents due to merging. With their resistance to content mixing, DE drops have key advantages for multistep reactions in drops, which is limited in SEs due to merging and content mixing.",

To study these dynamics we developed quantitative models that measure the effect of multiple factors on DNA methylomes including, age, sex, weight and genetics. We conducted our study in canids, which prove to be an ideal species to assess epigenetic moderators due to their extreme variability in size and well-characterized genetic structure. We collected buccal swabs from 217 canids (207 domestic dogs and 10 gray wolves) and used targeted bisulfite sequencing to measure methylomes. We also measured genotypes at over one thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found that DNA methylomes are strongly associated with age, enabling the construction of epigenetic clocks. We also show that methylomes are strongly impacted by sex, weight and sterilization status, leading to accurate predators of these factors. Methylomes are also affected by genetics and we observe multiple associations between SNP loci and methylated CpGs. Finally, we show that several factors moderate the relationship between epigenetic ages and real ages, such as body weight, which increases epigenetic aging. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the plasticity of DNA methylomes is impacted by myriad genetic and physiological factors, and that DNA methylation biomarkers are accurate predictors of age, sex and sterilization status.",

Depletion of molecular factors underlying genome topology, such as CTCF and cohesin, leads to modest alterations in gene expression, while genomic rearrangements involving boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) disrupt normal gene expression and can lead to pathological phenotypes. Here we inverted an almost entire TAD (245kb out of 300kb) within the X-inactivation centre (Xic), leaving its boundaries intact. This led to a significant rearrangement of topological contacts within the TAD, mostly in accordance to the orientation of underlying CTCF binding sites but suggesting heterogeneity in the \"contact\" potential of different CTCF sites. The inversion also led to increased contact insulation with the neighbouring TAD. Expression of most genes within the inverted TAD remained unaffected in mouse embryonic stem cells and during differentiation. Interestingly, expression in the neighbouring TAD of the noncoding transcript Xist, which controls X-chromosome inactivation, was ectopically upregulated. The same inversion in mouse embryos led to a bias in Xist expression, but X-inactivation choice ratios did not significantly deviate from wild type. Smaller deletions and inversions of specific clusters of CTCF sites within the TAD led to similar results: rearrangement of contacts, limited changes in local gene expression but significant changes in Xist expression. Our study suggests that the wiring of regulatory interactions within a TAD can influence the expression of genes in neighbouring TADs, highlighting the existence of mechanisms for inter-TAD communication.",

While cutting-edge microscopy technologies permit the routine acquisition of 3D datasets, there is currently a limited number of open-source software packages to analyse such images. Here we describe GIANI (djpbarry.github.io/Giani), new software for the analysis of 3D images, implemented as a plugin for the popular FIJI platform. The design primarily facilitates segmentation of nuclei and cells, followed by quantification of morphology and protein expression. GIANI enables routine and reproducible batch-processing of large numbers of images and also comes with scripting and command line tools, allowing users to incorporate its functionality into their own scripts and also run GIANI on a high-performance computing cluster. We demonstrate the utility of GIANI by quantifying cell morphology and protein expression in confocal images of mouse early embryos and by segmenting nuclei from light sheet microscopy images of the flour beetle embryo. We also validate the performance of the software using simulated data. More generally, we anticipate that GIANI will be a useful tool for researchers in a variety of biomedical fields.",

The dispersal history of this non-native commensal rodent across Europe, however, remains poorly understood, and different introductions may have occurred during the Roman and medieval periods. Here, in order to reconstruct the population history of European black rats, we generated a de novo genome assembly of the black rat, 67 ancient black rat mitogenomes and 36 ancient nuclear genomes from sites spanning the 1st-17th centuries CE in Europe and North Africa. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA confirm that black rats were introduced into the Mediterranean and Europe from Southwest Asia. Genomic analyses of the ancient rats reveal a population turnover in temperate Europe between the 6th and 10th centuries CE, coincident with an archaeologically attested decline in the black rat population. The near disappearance and re-emergence of black rats in Europe may have been the result of the breakdown of the Roman Empire, the First Plague Pandemic, and/or post-Roman climatic cooling.",

G4s display the highest enrichment at weaker splice sites, which are frequently involved in alternative splicing events. The importance of G4s in RNA as supposed to DNA is emphasized by a higher enrichment for the non-template strand. To explore if G4s are involved in dynamic alternative splicing responses, we analyzed RNA-seq data from mouse and human neuronal cells treated with potassium chloride. We find that G4s are enriched at exons which were skipped following potassium ion treatment. We validate the formation of stable G4s for three candidate splice sites by circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV-melting and fluorescence measurements. Finally, we explore G4 motifs across eleven representative species, and we observe that strong enrichment at splice sites is restricted to mammals and birds.",

We developed an approach to profile DNA replication from whole-genome sequencing of thousands of single cells, which includes \"in silico flow cytometry\", a method for discriminating replicating and non-replicating cells. Using two microfluidic platforms, we analyzed up to 2,437 replicating cells from a single sample. The resolution and scale of the data allow focused analysis of replication initiation sites, demonstrating that most occur in confined genomic regions. While initiation order is remarkably similar across cells, we unexpectedly identify several subtypes of initiation regions in late-replicating regions.

    "preprint_abstract": "Introductory paragraphThe Hedgehog (HH) pathway is critical for development and adult tissue homeostasis1. Aberrant HH signaling can cause congenital malformations, such as digit anomalies and holoprosencephaly2, and other diseases, including cancer3. Signal transduction is initiated by HH ligand binding to the Patched 1 (PTCH1) receptor on primary cilia, thereby releasing inhibition of Smoothened (SMO), a HH pathway activator4. Although cholesterol and several oxysterol lipids, which are enriched in the ciliary membrane, play a crucial role in HH activation4,5, the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of these lipid molecules remain unresolved. Here, we identify Canopy 4 (CNPY4), a Saposin-like protein, as a regulator of the HH pathway that controls membrane sterol lipid levels. Cnpy4-/- embryos exhibit multiple defects consistent with HH signaling perturbations, most notably changes in digit number. Knockdown of Cnpy4 hyperactivates the HH pathway at the level of SMO in vitro, and elevates membrane levels of accessible sterol lipids such as cholesterol, an endogenous ligand involved in SMO activation6. Thus, our data demonstrate that CNPY4 is a negative regulator that fine-tunes the initial steps of HH signal transduction, revealing a previously undescribed facet of HH pathway regulation that operates through control of membrane composition.",

The present study deeper characterized the geno- and phenotypes of this outbred mouse line and tested its suitability as an interventional obesity model. In contrast to previous findings, our data suggests that Titan mice are metabolically unhealthy obese and short-lived. Line-specific patterns of genetic invariability are in accordance with observed phenotypic traits. Titan mice show modifications in the liver transcriptome, proteome and epigenome that are linked to metabolic (dys)regulations. However, dietary intervention partially reversed the metabolic phenotype in Titan mice and significantly extended their life expectancy.

The spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of RaTG13 contains a large number of amino acid substitutions when compared to SARS-CoV-2, likely impacting affinity for the ACE2 receptor. Antigenic differences between the viruses are less well understood, especially whether RaTG13 spike can be efficiently neutralised by antibodies generated from infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Using RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes we compared neutralisation using convalescent sera from previously infected patients as well as vaccinated healthcare workers. Surprisingly, our results revealed that RaTG13 was more efficiently neutralised than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, neutralisation assays using spike chimeras and mutants harbouring single amino acid substitutions within the RBD demonstrated that both spike proteins can tolerate multiple changes without dramatically reducing how efficiently they are neutralised. Moreover, introducing the 484K mutation into RaTG13 resulted in increased neutralisation, in contrast to the same mutation in SARS-CoV-2 (E484K). This is despite E484K having a well-documented role in immune evasion in variants of concern (VOC) such as B.1.351 (Beta). These results indicate that the immune-escape mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be driven by strong antibody pressures, and that the future spill-over of RaTG13 and/or related sarbecoviruses could be mitigated using current SARS-CoV-2-based vaccination strategies.",

Reconstitution of the intasome from the maedi-visna virus (MVV), an ovine lentivirus, revealed a large assembly containing sixteen IN subunits (1). Herein, we report cryo-EM structures of the lentiviral intasome prior to engagement of target DNA and following strand transfer, refined at 3.4 and 3.5 [A] resolution, respectively. The structures elucidate details of the protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces involved in lentiviral intasome formation. We show that the homomeric interfaces involved in IN hexadecamer formation and the -helical configuration of the linker connecting the C-terminal and catalytic core domains are critical for MVV IN strand transfer activity in vitro and for virus infectivity. Single-molecule microscopy in conjunction with photobleaching revealed that the MVV intasome can bind a variable number, up to sixteen molecules, of the lentivirus-specific host factor LEDGF/p75. Concordantly, ablation of endogenous LEDGF/p75 resulted in gross redistribution of MVV integration sites in human and ovine cells. Our data confirm the importance of the expanded architecture observed in cryo-EM studies of lentiviral intasomes and suggest that this organization underlies multivalent interactions with chromatin for integration targeting to active genes.",

For insects, sleep characterization has been primarily achieved using behavioral and electrophysiological correlates in a few systems. Sleep in mosquitoes, which are important vectors of disease-causing pathogens, has not been directly examined. This is surprising as circadian rhythms, which have been well studied in mosquitoes, influence sleep in other systems. In this study, we characterized sleep in mosquitoes using body posture analysis and behavioral correlates, and quantified the effect of sleep deprivation on sleep rebound, host landing and blood-feeding propensity. Body and appendage position metrics revealed a clear distinction between the posture of mosquitoes in their putative sleep and awake states for multiple species, which correlate with a reduction in responsiveness to host cues. Sleep assessment informed by these posture analyses indicated significantly more sleep during periods of low activity. Nighttime and daytime sleep deprivation resulting from the delivery of vibration stimuli induced sleep rebound in the subsequent phase in day and night active mosquitoes, respectively. Lastly, sleep deprivation suppressed host landing in both laboratory and field settings and also impaired blood feeding of a human host when mosquitoes would normally be active. These results suggest that quantifiable sleep states occur in mosquitoes, and highlight the potential epidemiological importance of mosquito sleep.",

Pathologies lead to detectable changes in the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) profile of animals, which can be monitored, thus allowing the development of a rapid VOC-based test. In the current study, we successfully trained honeybees (Apis mellifera) to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected minks (Neovison vison) thanks to Pavlovian conditioning protocols. The bees can be quickly conditioned to respond specifically to infected minks odours and could therefore be part of a wider SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic system. We tested two different training protocols to evaluate their performance in terms of learning rate, accuracy and memory retention. We designed a non-invasive rapid test in which multiple bees are tested in parallel on the same samples. This provided reliable results regarding a subjects health status. Using the data from the training experiments, we simulated a diagnostic evaluation trial to predict the potential efficacy of our diagnostic test, which yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 86%. We suggest that a honeybee-based diagnostics can offer a reliable and rapid test that provides a readily available, low-input addition to the currently available testing methods. A honeybee-based diagnostic test might be particularly relevant for remote and developing communities that lack the resources and infrastructure required for mainstream testing methods.",

It is well known that locomotor transitions can be induced by switching in neural control circuits or be driven by a need to minimize metabolic energetic cost. Recent work discovered that locomotor transitions in complex 3-D terrain cluttered with large obstacles can also emerge from physical interaction with the environment controlled by the nervous system. To traverse cluttered, stiff grass-like beams, the discoid cockroach often transitions from using a strenuous pitch mode to push across to using a less strenuous roll mode to maneuver through the gaps, during which a potential energy barrier must be overcome. Although previous robotic physical modeling demonstrated that kinetic energy fluctuation from body oscillation generated by leg propulsion can help overcome the barrier and facilitate this transition, the animal was observed to transition even when the barrier still exceeds kinetic energy fluctuation. Here, we further studied whether and how the cockroach makes active adjustments to facilitate this locomotor transition to traverse cluttered beams. We observed that the animal flexed its head and abdomen, reduced hind leg sprawl, and used both hind legs differentially during the pitch-to-roll transition, which were absent when running on a flat ground. Using a refined potential energy landscape with additional degrees of freedom modeling these adjustments, we found that head flexion did not substantially reduce the transition barrier, whereas the leg sprawl reduction did so dramatically. We discussed likely functions of the observed adjustments and suggested future directions.",

Little is known however of the interaction of BRC repeats in other species, especially in protozoans where variable number of BRC repeats are found in BRCA2 proteins. Here we have studied in detail the interactions of the two BRC repeats in Leishmania infantum BRCA2 with RAD51. We show that the LiBRC1 is a high affinity repeat with a KD of 0.29 M while LiBRC2 binds to RAD51 with a KD of 13.5 M. A crystal structure of LiBRC1 complexed with LiRAD51 revels an extended {beta}-hairpin compared to human BRC4 and shows that the equivalent of human LFDE motif is not interacting with LiRAD51. A truncation analysis of LiBRC1 confirms that a shorter repeat is sufficient for high affinity interaction and this minimal repeat is functional in inhibiting the formation of LiRAD51-ssDNA nucleofilament.",

A model based on the intrinsic growth kinetics for a wild type strain and its LasR- derivative, in combination with an experimental evolution based genetic screen and further genetics analyses, indicated that differences in metabolism were sufficient to explain the rise of these common mutant types. The evolution of LasR- lineages in laboratory and clinical isolates depended on activity of the two-component system CbrAB, which modulates substrate prioritization through the catabolite repression control pathway. LasR- lineages frequently arise in cystic fibrosis lung infections and their detection correlates with disease severity. Our analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid metabolomes identified compounds that negatively correlate with lung function, and we show that these compounds support enhanced growth of LasR- cells in a CbrB-controlled manner. We propose that in vivo metabolomes are a major driver of pathogen evolution, which may influence the progression of disease and its treatment.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) has been proposed as a biomarker of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction in schizophrenia. Pathophysiological theories suggest that such dysfunction might be partially caused by aberrant interactions of different modulatory neurotransmitters with NMDARs, which could explain heterogeneity among patients with schizophrenia and their treatment response. Understanding the differential impact of different neuromodulators on readouts of NMDAR function is therefore of high clinical relevance.\n\nHere, we report results from two studies (N=81 each) which systematically tested whether the MMN is sensitive to diminishing and enhancing cholinergic vs. dopaminergic function. Both studies used a double-blind, placebo-controlled between-subject design and monitored individual drug plasma levels. Using a novel variant of the auditory oddball paradigm, we contrasted phases with stable versus volatile probabilities of tone switches. In the first study, we found that the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist biperiden reduced and/or delayed mismatch responses, particularly during stable phases of the experiment, whereas this effect was absent for amisulpride, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist. The direct comparison between biperiden and amisulpride indicated a significant drug x mismatch interaction. In the second study, neither elevating acetylcholine nor dopamine levels via administration of galantamine and levodopa, respectively, exerted significant effects on MMN.\n\nOverall, our results indicate differential sensitivity of the MMN to changes in cholinergic (muscarinic) versus dopaminergic receptor function. This finding may prove useful for developments of future tools for predicting individual treatment responses in disorders that show abnormal MMN, such as schizophrenia.",

Here, we used bottom-up proteomics and label-free quantification to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) on beta-myosin heavy chain ({beta}-MHC) in normal and failing human heart tissues. We report six acetylated lysines and two phosphorylated residues: K34-Ac, K58-Ac, S210-P, K213-Ac, T215-P, K429-Ac, K951-Ac, and K1195-Ac. K951-Ac was significantly reduced in both ischemic and non-ischemic failing hearts compared to non-diseased hearts. Molecular dynamics simulations show that K951-Ac may impact stability of thick filament tail interactions and ultimately myosin head positioning. K58-Ac altered the solvent exposed SH3 domain surface - known for protein-protein interactions - but did not appreciably change motor domain conformation or dynamics under conditions studied. Together, K213-Ac/T215-P altered loop 1s structure and dynamics - known to regulate ADP-release, ATPase activity, and sliding velocity. Our study suggests that {beta}-MHC acetylation levels may be influenced more by the PTM location than the type of heart disease since less protected acetylation sites are reduced in both heart failure groups. Additionally, these PTMs have potential to modulate interactions between {beta}-MHC and other regulatory sarcomeric proteins, ADP-release rate of myosin, flexibility of the S2 region, and cardiac myofilament contractility in normal and heart failure hearts.",

Microfluidic based biochips have many advantages over other 3D cell culture models for drug testing on spheroids, including precise control of the cellular microenvironment. The control of the cell adhesion to the surface is one of the most important challenges affecting the size and the geometry of the spheroids which could be controlled by appropriate surface engineering methods. We have studied the modification of the PDMS surface properties treated by applying different concentrations of the two anti-fouling coatings (BSA and Pluronic F-68). The desired treatment of PDMS surface effectively inhibits cell adhesion to the surface and promotes cells self-aggregations to form more uniform and healthy spheroids for a longer period of time. The microscopic observations with qualitative and quantitate data revealed that surface properties drastically affect the number of the spheroids formed on-chip and their geometry. We used human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231-GFP) while the concentration of the chemical coatings and incubation time were adjusted. Proper repellent PDMS surfaces were provided with minimum cell attachment and facilitated spheroid formation when compared with non-treated PDMS. The results demonstrate fundamental and helpful patterns for microfluidic based cell culture applications to improve the quantity and quality of spheroid formation on-chip which are strongly manipulated by surface properties (i.e., morphology, roughness, wettability and etc.)",

This study investigated the impact of sodium silicate corrosion control on biomass accumulation in drinking water systems in comparison to orthophosphate, a common corrosion inhibitor. Biofilm growth was measured by determining ATP concentrations, and the bacterial community was characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing. A pilot-scale study with cast-iron pipe loops, annular reactors (ARs), and polycarbonate coupons demonstrated significantly lower biofilm ATP concentrations in the sodium silicate-treated AR than the orthophosphate-treated AR when the water temperature exceeded 20{degrees}C. However, an elevated sodium silicate dose (48 mg L-1 of SiO2) disturbed and dispersed the biofilm formed inside the AR, resulting in elevated effluent ATP concentrations. Two separate experiments confirmed that biomass accumulation was higher in the presence of orthophosphate at high water temperatures (20{degrees}C) only. No significant differences were identified in biofilm ATP concentrations at lower water temperatures (below 20{degrees}C). Differences in bacterial communities between the orthophosphate- and sodium silicate-treated systems were not statistically significant, even though orthophosphate promoted higher biofilm growth. However, the genera Halomonas and Mycobacterium--which include opportunistic pathogens--were present at greater relative abundances in the orthophosphate-treated system compared to the sodium silicate system.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/460503v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ac86corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac500borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb2980org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1b5c0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Orthophosphate promotes more biofilm growth in comparison to sodium silicates at water temperatures above 20{degrees}C.\n\nWater impact statementSodium silicates have been used in drinking water treatment for decades, both as sequestrants and as corrosion inhibitors.

Recent progress in elucidating the genetic architecture of schizophrenia has highlighted the association of multiple loci and rare variants that may impact susceptibility. One key example, given their potential etiopathogenic and therapeutic relevance, is a set of genes that encode proteins that regulate excitatory glutamatergic synapses in brain. A critical next step is to delineate specifically how such genetic variation impacts synaptic plasticity and to determine if and how the encoded proteins interact biochemically with one another to control cognitive function in a convergent manner. Towards this goal, here we study the roles of GPCR-kinase interacting protein 1 (GIT1), a synaptic scaffolding and signaling protein with damaging coding variants found in schizophrenia patients, as well as copy number variants found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. We generated conditional neural-selective GIT1 knockout mice and find that these mice have deficits in fear conditioning learning and spatial memory. Using global quantitative phospho-proteomics, we revealed that GIT1 deletion in brain perturbs specific networks of GIT1-interacting synaptic proteins. Importantly, several schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes are present within these networks. We propose that GIT1 regulates the phosphorylation of a network of synaptic proteins and other critical regulators of neuroplasticity, and that perturbation of these networks may contribute to cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the spiking projection neurons of the retina, comprise over 40 different types in mice and other mammals, each tuned to different features of visual scenes. The circuits providing synaptic input to different RGC types to drive feature selectivity have been studied extensively, but there has been substantially less research aimed at understanding how the intrinsic properties of RGCs differ and how those differences impact feature selectivity. Here, we introduce an RGC type in the mouse, the Bursty Suppressed-by-Contrast (bSbC) RGC, whose contrast selectivity is shaped by its intrinsic properties. Surprisingly, when we compare the bSbC RGC to the OFF sustained alpha (OFFsA) RGC that receives similar synaptic input, we find that the two RGC types exhibit starkly different responses to an identical stimulus. We identified spike generation as the key intrinsic property behind this functional difference; the bSbC RGC undergoes depolarization block in conditions where the OFFsA RGC maintains a high spike rate. Pharmacological experiments, imaging, and compartment modeling demonstrate that these differences in spike generation are the result of differences in voltage-gated sodium channel conductances. Our results demonstrate that differences in intrinsic properties allow these two RGC types to detect and relay distinct features of an identical visual stimulus to the brain.",

Here, we study a collision avoidance behavior in Drosophila as a simple model of motion-based spatial vision. With simulations and psychophysics, we demonstrate that walking Drosophila exhibit a pattern of slowing to avoid collisions by exploiting the geometry of positional changes of objects on near-collision courses. This behavior requires the visual neuron LPLC1, whose tuning mirrors the behavior and whose activity drives slowing. LPLC1 pools inputs from object- and motion-detectors, and spatially biased inhibition tunes it to the geometry of collisions. Connectomic analyses identified circuitry downstream of LPLC1 that faithfully inherits its response properties. Overall, our results reveal how a small neural circuit solves a specific spatial vision task by combining distinct visual features to exploit universal geometrical constraints of the visual world.",

We showed that the {beta}-catenin-mediated signaling activation in these cells is Wnt ligand- and receptor-independent but relies on AKT/mTOR pathway and is essential for cell survival. Such adipocytes are distinct from classical ones in transcriptomic and genomic signatures and can be induced from various sources of mesenchymal stromal cells including human cells. Genetic lineage-tracing and targeted cell ablation studies revealed that these adipocytes convert into beige adipocytes directly and are also required for beige fat recruitment under thermal challenge, demonstrating both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles in adaptive thermogenesis. Furthermore, mice bearing targeted ablation of these adipocytes exhibited glucose intolerance, while mice receiving exogenously supplied such cells manifested enhanced glucose utilization.

The resultant improvement in vascular patency and perfusion has been shown to increase the delivery of therapeutic molecules. We show that PEGPH20 also improves the efficacy of radiation therapy in a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma BxPC3 mouse model overexpressing hyaluronan synthase 3 (BxPC3-HAS3) while exerting little effect on the corresponding wild type tumors. Mice overexpressing HAS3 developed fast growing, radiation resistant tumors that became rapidly more hypoxic as time progressed. Treatment with PEGPH20 increased survival times when used in combination with radiation therapy, significantly more than either radiation therapy or PEGPH20 alone. Radiosensitization in BxPC3-HAS3 tumors was attributed to an increase in local pO2 as studied by by EPR imaging. No effect on survival, radiation treatment, or pO2 was seen in wild type tumors after PEGPH20 treatment. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI and MRI based blood volume imaging showed improved perfusion/permeability and local blood volume, respectively, in BxPC3-HAS3 tumors after PEGPH20 treatment, accounting for the increase in tumor oxygenation. Photoacoustic imaging indicated immediate changes in tumor oxygenation after treatment. Metabolic MRI using hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate suggested a metabolic shift towards decreased glycolytic flux after PEGPH20 treatment. In summary, the results showed that PEGPH20 may be useful for radiosensitization of pancreatic cancer but only in the subset of tumors with substantial hyaluronan accumulation and the response of the treatment may potentially be monitored non-invasive imaging of the hemodynamic and metabolic changes in the tumor microenvironment.",

Isoforms lacking exon 2 were predominant at approximately 10% of TREM2 mRNA in the brain. Expression of TREM2 and frequency of exon 2 skipping did not differ between AD samples and non-AD controls (p = 0.1268 and p = 0.4909, respectively). Further, these novel splice isoforms were also observed across multiple tissues with similar frequency (range 5.3 - 13.0%). We found that the exon 2 skipped isoform D2-TREM2 is translated to protein and localizes similarly to full-length TREM2 protein, that both proteins are primarily retained in the Golgi complex, and that D2-TREM2 is expressed in AD and non-AD brain.\n\nConclusionSince the TREM2 ligand binding domain is encoded by exon 2, and skipping this exon retains reading frame while conserving localization, we hypothesize that D2-TREM2 acts as an inhibitor of TREM2 and targeting TREM2 splicing may be a novel therapeutic pathway for AD.",

Moreover, several N-terminal truncations and phosphorylation/nitration differentially modify the level of SYN detection and recovery by different immunoassays, and a CSF matrix effect was observed for most of the SYN proteoforms analyzed by the three immunoassays.\n\nConclusionsOur results showed that these immunoassays do not capture the totality of the relevant SYN species and therefore may not be appropriate tools to provide an accurate measure of total SYN levels in samples containing modified forms of the protein.

    "preprint_abstract": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disease characterized by progressive and catastrophic heterotopic ossification (HO) of skeletal muscle and associated soft tissues. FOP is caused by dominantly acting mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, ACVR1 (also known as ALK2), the most prevalent of which is an arginine to histidine substitution [ACVR1(R206H)] in the glycine-serine rich intracellular domain of the receptor. A fundamental pathological consequence of FOP-causing ACVR1 receptor mutations is to enable activin A to initiate canonical BMP signaling in responsive progenitors, which drives skeletogenic commitment and HO. With the clear targets of activin A and ACVR1 identified, development of antibody therapeutics to prevent ligand-receptor interactions is an interventional approach currently being explored. Here, we developed a monoclonal blocking antibody (JAB0505) to the extracellular domain of ACVR1 and tested its ability to inhibit HO in established FOP mouse models. JAB0505 inhibited BMP-dependent gene expression in wild-type and ACVR1(R206H)-overexpressing cell lines. Strikingly, however, JAB0505 treatment markedly exacerbated injury-induced HO in two independent FOP mouse models in which ACVR1(R206H) was either broadly expressed, or more selectively expressed in fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). JAB0505 drove HO even under conditions of activin A inhibition, indicating that JAB0505 has receptor agonist activity. JAB0505-treated mice exhibited multiple, distinct foci of heterotopic lesions, suggesting an atypically broad anatomical domain of FAP recruitment to endochondral ossification. In addition, skeletogenic differentiation was both delayed and prolonged, and this was accompanied by dysregulation of FAP population growth. Collectively, alterations in the growth and differentiative properties of FAPs and FAP-derived skeletal cells are implicated in the aggravated HO phenotype. These data raise serious safety and efficacy concerns for the use of anti-ACVR1 antibodies to treat FOP patients.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Aberrant epithelial differentiation and regeneration contribute to colon pathologies including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). MTG16 (CBFA2T3) is a transcriptional corepressor expressed in the colonic epithelium. MTG16 deficiency in mice exacerbates colitis and increases tumor burden in CAC, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified MTG16 as a central mediator of epithelial differentiation, promoting goblet and restraining enteroendocrine cell development in homeostasis and enabling regeneration following dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Transcriptomic analyses implicated increased E box-binding transcription factor (E protein) activity in MTG16-deficient colon crypts. Using a novel mouse model with a point mutation that disrupts MTG16:E protein complex formation (Mtg16P209T), we established that MTG16 exerts control over colonic epithelial differentiation and regeneration by repressing E protein-mediated transcription. Mimicking murine colitis, MTG16 expression was increased in biopsies from patients with active IBD compared to unaffected controls. Finally, uncoupling MTG16:E protein interactions only partially phenocopied the enhanced tumorigenicity of Mtg16-/- colon in the azoxymethane(AOM)/DSS-induced model of CAC, indicating that MTG16 protects from tumorigenesis through additional mechanisms. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MTG16, via its repression of E protein targets, is a key regulator of cell fate decisions during colon homeostasis, colitis, and cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467178v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21948borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f60eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@194b9fdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13eb1a7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To determine the salt stress level of a plant endures, one can measure these structural and chemical changes. Raman spectroscopy and biochemical analysis are some of the most common techniques in the literature. Here, we present a combination of machine learning and Raman spectroscopy with which we can both find out the biochemical change that occurs while the medium salt concentration changes and predict the level of salt stress a wheat sample experiences accurately using our trained regression models. In addition, by applying different machine learning algorithms, we compare the level of success for different algorithms and determine the best method to use in this application. Production units can take actions based on the quantitative information they get from the trained machine learning models related to salt stress, which can potentially increase efficiency and avoid the loss of crops.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Both conflict and error processing have been linked to the midfrontal theta power (4-8 Hz) increase as indicated by EEG studies and greater hemodynamic activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) as indicated by fMRI studies. Conveniently, the source of the midfrontal theta power was estimated in or nearby aMCC. However, previous studies using concurrent EEG and fMRI recordings in resting-state or other cognitive tasks observed only a negative relationship between theta power and BOLD signal in the brain regions typically showing task-related deactivations. In this study, we used a simultaneous EEG-fMRI technique to investigate a trial-by-trial coupling between theta power and hemodynamic activity during the performance of two conflict tasks. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to denoise the EEG signal and select individual midfrontal EEG components, whereas group ICA was applied to fMRI data to obtain a functional parcellation of the frontal cortex. Using a linear mixed- effect model, theta power was coupled with the peak of hemodynamic responses from various frontal, cingulate, and insular cortical sites to unravel the potential brain sources that contribute to conflict- and error-related theta variability. Although several brain regions exhibited conflict-related increases in hemodynamic activity, the conflict pre-response theta showed only a negative correlation to BOLD signal in the midline area 9 (MA9), a region exhibiting conflict-sensitive deactivation. Conversely, and more expectedly, error-related theta showed a positive relationship to activity in the aMCC. Our results provide novel evidence suggesting that the amplitude of pre-response theta reflects the process of active inhibition that suppresses the MA9 activity. This process is affected independently by the stimulus congruency, reaction times variance, and is susceptible to the time-on-task effect. Finally, it predicts the commitment of an omission error. Together, our findings highlight that conflict- and error-related theta oscillations represent fundamentally different processes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The cortico-basal ganglia circuit is needed to suppress prepotent actions and to facilitate controlled behavior. Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus [STN] exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal [STN-Globus Pallidus externus (GPe)] network, and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN \"conflict detector\" units, due to an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In humans, sleep spindles are 10-16 Hz oscillations lasting approximately 0.5-2 s. Spindles, along with cortical slow oscillations, facilitate memory consolidation by enabling synaptic plasticity. Early recordings of spindles at the scalp found anterior channels had overall slower frequency than central-posterior channels. This robust, topographical finding led to dichotomizing spindles as  slow versus  fast, modelled as two distinct spindle generators in frontal versus posterior cortex. Using a large dataset of intracranial sEEG recordings (n=20, 365 bipolar recordings), we show that the difference in spindle frequency between frontal and parietal channels is comparable to the variability in spindle frequency within the course of individual spindles, across different spindles recorded by a given site, and across sites within a given region. Thus, fast and slow spindles only capture average differences that obscure a much larger underlying overlap in frequency. Furthermore, differences in mean frequency are only one of several ways that spindles differ. For example, compared to parietal, frontal spindles are smaller, tend to occur after parietal when both are engaged, and show a larger decrease in frequency within-spindles. However, frontal and parietal spindles are similar in being longer, less variable, and more widespread than occipital, temporal, and Rolandic spindles. These characteristics are accentuated in spindles which are highly phase-locked to posterior hippocampal spindles. We propose that rather than a strict parietal-fast/frontal-slow dichotomy, spindles differ continuously and quasi-independently in multiple dimensions, with variability due about equally to within-spindle, within-region and between-region factors.\n\nSignificance StatementSleep spindles are 10-16 Hz neural oscillations generated by cortico-thalamic circuits that promote memory consolidation. Spindles are often dichotomized into slow-anterior and fast-posterior categories for cognitive and clinical studies. Here, we show that the anterior-posterior difference in spindle frequency is comparable to that observed between different cycles of individual spindles, between spindles from a given site, or from different sites within a region. Further, we show that spindles vary on other dimensions such as duration, amplitude, spread, primacy and consistency, and that these multiple dimensions vary continuously and largely independently across cortical regions. These findings suggest that multiple continuous variables rather than a strict frequency dichotomy may be more useful biomarkers for memory consolidation or psychiatric disorders.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Learning is an essential cognitive mechanism allowing behavioral adaptation through adjustments in neuronal processing. It is associated with changes in the activity of sensory cortical neurons evoked by task-relevant stimuli. However, the exact nature of those modifications and the computational advantages they may confer are still debated. Here, we investigated how learning an orientation discrimination task alters the neuronal representations of the cues orientations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of male and female mice. When comparing the activity evoked by the task stimuli in naive mice and mice performing the task, we found that the representations of the orientation of the rewarded and non-rewarded cues were more accurate and stable in trained mice. This better cue representation in trained mice was associated with a distortion of the orientation representation space such that stimuli flanking the task-relevant orientations were represented as the task stimuli themselves, suggesting that those stimuli were generalized as the task cues. This distortion was context dependent as it was absent in trained mice passively viewing the task cues and enhanced in the behavioral sessions where mice performed best. Those modifications of the V1 population orientation representation in performing mice were supported by a suppression of the activity of neurons tuned for orientations neighboring the orientations of the task cues. Thus, visual processing in V1 is dynamically adapted to enhance the reliability of the representation of the learned cues and favor generalization in the task-relevant computational space.\n\nSignificance statementPerformance improvement in a task often requires facilitating the extraction of the information necessary to its execution. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a suppression mechanism that improves the representation of the orientations of the task stimuli in the V1 of mice performing an orientation discrimination task. We also show that this mechanism distorts the V1 orientation representation space, leading stimuli flanking the task stimuli orientations to be generalized as the task stimuli themselves.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In Drosophila, in vivo functional imaging studies revealed that associative memory formation is coupled to a cascade of neural plasticity events in distinct compartments of the mushroom body (MB). In-depth investigation of the circuit dynamics, however, will require an ex vivo model that faithfully mirrors these events to allow direct manipulations of circuit elements that are inaccessible in the intact fly. The current ex vivo models have been able to reproduce the fundamental plasticity of aversive short-term memory, a potentiation of the MB intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells; KCs) responses after artificial learning ex vivo. However, this potentiation showed different localization and encoding properties from those reported in vivo and failed to generate the previously reported suppression plasticity in the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). Here, we develop an ex vivo model using the female Drosophila brain that recapitulates behaviorally evoked plasticity in the KCs and MBONs. We demonstrate that this plasticity accurately localizes to the MB 3 compartment and is encoded by a coincidence between KCs activation and dopaminergic input. The formed plasticity is input-specific, requiring pairing of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) pathways; hence we name it pairing-dependent plasticity (PDP). PDP formation requires an intact CaMKII gene and is blocked by previous-night sleep deprivation but is rescued by rebound sleep. In conclusion, we show that our ex vivo preparation recapitulates behavioral and imaging results from intact animals and can provide new insights into mechanisms of memory formation at the level of molecules, circuits, and brain state.\n\nSignificance StatementThe mammalian ex vivo LTP model enabled in-depth investigation of the hippocampal memory circuit. We develop a parallel model to study the Drosophila mushroom body (MB) memory circuit. Pairing activation of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus pathways in dissected brains induces a potentiation pairing-dependent plasticity (PDP) in the axons of {beta} Kenyon cells and a suppression PDP in the dendrites of their postsynaptic MB output neurons, localized in the MB 3 compartment. This PDP is input-specific and requires the 3 untranslated region of CaMKII. Interestingly, ex vivo PDP carries information about the animals experience before dissection; brains from sleep deprived animals fail to form PDP while those from animals who recovered 2 hours of their lost sleep form PDP.",

In the mammalian retina, the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell (On-Off DSGC) is well known for its robust direction selectivity. However, how the On-Off DSGC light responsiveness dynamically adjusts to the changing visual environment is underexplored. Here, we report that the On-Off DSGC can be transiently sensitized by prior stimuli. Notably, distinct sensitization patterns are found in dorsal and ventral DSGCs that receive visual inputs from lower and upper visual fields respectively. Although responses of both dorsal and ventral DSGCs to dark stimuli (Off responses) are sensitized, only dorsal cells show sensitization of responses to bright stimuli (On responses). Visual stimulation to the dorsal retina potentiates a sustained excitatory input from Off bipolar cells, leading to tonic depolarization of dorsal DSGCs. Such tonic depolarization propagates from the Off to the On dendritic arbor of the DSGC to sensitize its On response. We also identified a previously overlooked feature of DSGC dendritic architecture that can support direct electrotonic propagation between On and Off dendritic layers. By contrast, ventral DSGCs lack a sensitized tonic depolarization and thus do not exhibit sensitization of their On responses. Our results highlight a topographic difference in Off bipolar cell inputs underlying divergent sensitization patterns of dorsal and ventral On-Off DSGCs. Moreover, substantial crossovers between dendritic layers of On-Off DSGCs suggest an interactive dendritic algorithm for processing On and Off signals before they reach the soma.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Metagenomics has become a prominent technology to study the functional potential of all organisms in a microbial community. Most studies focus on the bacterial content of these communities, while ignoring eukaryotic microbes. Indeed, many metagenomics analysis pipelines silently assume that all contigs in a metagenome are prokaryotic. However, because of marked differences in gene structure, prokaryotic gene prediction tools fail to accurately predict eukaryotic genes. Here, we developed a classifier that distinguishes eukaryotic from prokaryotic contigs based on foundational differences between these taxa in gene structure. We first developed a random forest classifier that uses intergenic distance, gene density and gene length as the most important features. We show that, with an estimated accuracy of 97%, this classifier with principled features grounded in biology can perform almost as well as the classifiers EukRep and Tiara, which use k-mer frequencies as features. By re-training our classifier with Tiara predictions as additional feature, weaknesses of both types of classifiers are compensated; the result is an enhanced classifier that outperforms all individual classifiers, with an F1-score of 1.00 on precision, recall and accuracy for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, while still being fast. In a reanalysis of metagenome data from a disease-suppressive plant endosphere microbial community, we show how using Whokaryote to select contigs for eukaryotic gene prediction facilitates the discovery of several biosynthetic gene clusters that were missed in the original study.

It is cultivated and traded internationally due to its high-quality nuts thus, has significant development prospects and scientific research value. However, information on the genetic resources of Macadamia spp. remains scanty.\n\nResultsThe mitochondria (mt) genomes of three economically important Macadamia species, Macadamia integrifolia, M. ternifolia and M. tetraphylla, were assembled through the Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed that each species has 71 genes, including 42 protein-coding genes, 26 tRNAs, and 3 rRNAs. Repeated sequence analysis, RNA editing site prediction, and analysis of genes migrating from chloroplast (cp) to mt were performed in the mt genomes of the three Macadamia species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the mt genome of the three Macadamia species and 35 other species was conducted to reveal the evolution and taxonomic status of Macadamia. Furthermore, the characteristics of the plant mt genome, including genome size and GC content, were studied through comparison with 36 other plant species. The final non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution analysis showed that most of the protein-coding genes in the mt genome underwent negative selections, indicating their importance in the mt genome.\n\nConclusionThe findings of this study provide a better understanding of the Macadamia genome and will inform future research on the genus.",

To this end, twenty-five rice genotypes belonging to the flood-irrigated rice breeding program were evaluated. Grain yield and flowering were evaluated in the agricultural year 2017/2018. The experimental design used in all experiments was a randomized block design with three replications. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to estimate genetic parameters and genetic values. The flowering is highly heritable by the Bayesian credibility interval: h2 = 0.039-0.80, and 0.02-0.91, environment 1 and 2, respectively. The genetic correlation between traits was significantly different from zero in the two environments (environment 1: -0.80 to 0.74; environment 2: -0.82 to 0.86. The relationship of CVe and CVg higher for flowering in the reduced model (CVg/CVe= 5.83 and 13.98, environments 1 and 2, respectively). For the complete model, this trait presented an estimate of the relative variation index of: CVe= 4.28 and 4.21, environments 1 and 2, respectively. In summary, the multi-trait and multi-environment Bayesian model allowed a reliable estimate of the genetic parameter of flood-irrigated rice. Bayesian analyzes provide robust inference of genetic parameters. Therefore, we recommend this model for genetic evaluation of flood-irrigated rice genotypes, and their generalization, in other crops. Precise estimates of genetic parameters bring new perspectives on the application of Bayesian methods to solve modeling problems in the genetic improvement of flood-irrigated rice.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Certain DNA sequences, including mirror-symmetric polypyrimidine/polypurine runs, are capable of folding into a triple-helix-containing non-B-form DNA structure called H-DNA. Such H-DNA-forming sequences are frequent in many eukaryotic genomes, including in mammals, and multiple lines of evidence indicate that these motifs are mutagenic and can impinge on DNA replication, transcription, and other aspects of genome function. In this study, we show that the triplex-forming potential of H-DNA motifs in the mouse genome can be evaluated using S1-sequencing (S1-seq), which uses the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-specific nuclease S1 to generate deep-sequencing libraries that report on the position of ssDNA throughout the genome. When S1-seq was applied to genomic DNA isolated from mouse testis cells and splenic B cells, we observed prominent clusters of S1-seq reads that appeared to be independent of endogenous double-strand breaks, that coincided with H-DNA motifs, and that correlated strongly with the triplex-forming potential of the motifs. Fine-scale patterns of S1-seq reads, including a pronounced strand asymmetry in favor of centrally-positioned reads on the pyrimidine-containing strand, suggested that this S1-seq signal is specific for one of the four possible isomers of H-DNA (H-y5). By leveraging the abundance and complexity of naturally occurring H-DNA motifs across the mouse genome, we further defined how polypyrimidine repeat length and the presence of repeat-interrupting substitutions modify the structure of H-DNA.

    "preprint_abstract": "Using a series of multiheme cytochromes, the metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 can perform extracellular electron transfer (EET) to respire redox-active surfaces, including minerals and electrodes outside the cell. While the role of multiheme cytochromes in transporting electrons across the cell wall is well established, these cytochromes were also recently found to facilitate long-distance (micrometer-scale) redox conduction along outer membranes and across multiple cells bridging electrodes. Recent studies proposed that long-distance conduction arises from the interplay of electron hopping and cytochrome diffusion, which allows collisions and electron exchange between cytochromes along membranes. However, the diffusive dynamics of the multiheme cytochromes have never been observed or quantified in vivo, making it difficult to assess their hypothesized contribution to the collision-exchange mechanism. Here we use quantum dot labeling, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and single-particle tracking to quantify the lateral diffusive dynamics of the outer membrane-associated decaheme cytochromes MtrC and OmcA, two key components of EET in S. oneidensis. We observe confined diffusion behavior for both quantum dot-labeled MtrC and OmcA along cell surfaces (diffusion coefficients DMtrC = 0.0192 {+/-} 0.0018 m2/s, DOmcA = 0.0125 {+/-} 0.0024 m2/s) and the membrane extensions thought to function as bacterial nanowires. We find that these dynamics can trace a path for electron transport via overlap of cytochrome trajectories, consistent with the long-distance conduction mechanism. The measured dynamics inform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that combine direct electron hopping and redox molecule diffusion, revealing significant electron transport rates along cells and membrane nanowires.\n\nSignificanceMultiheme cytochromes in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 transport electrons across the cell wall, in a process called extracellular electron transfer. These electron conduits can also enable electron transport along and between cells. While the underlying mechanism is thought to involve a combination of electron hopping and lateral diffusion of cytochromes along membranes, these diffusive dynamics have never been observed in vivo. Here, we observe the mobility of quantum dot-labeled cytochromes on living cell surfaces and membrane nanowires, quantify their diffusion with single-particle tracking techniques, and simulate the contribution of these dynamics to electron transport. This work reveals the impact of redox molecule dynamics on bacterial electron transport, with implications for understanding and harnessing this process in the environment and bioelectronics.",

MaxQuant and MSstats in Galaxy can be applied in conjunction with thousands of existing Galaxy tools and integrated into standardized, sharable workflows. Galaxy tracks all metadata and intermediate results in analysis histories, which can be shared privately for collaborations or publicly, allowing full reproducibility and transparency of published analysis.

A major source of current dynamic structure data is Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Several methods have been proposed to investigate the free energy landscape from MD data, but all of them rely on the assumption that kinetic similarity is associated with global geometric similarity, which may lead to unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we proposed a new method called Conditional Angle Partition Tree to reveal the hierarchical free energy landscape by correlating local geometric similarity with kinetic similarity. Its application on the benchmark alanine dipeptide MD data showed a much better performance than existing methods in exploring and understanding the free energy landscape. We also applied it to the MD data of Villin HP35. Our results are more reasonable on various aspects than those from other methods and very informative on the hierarchical structure of its energy landscape.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mean grain weight (MGW) is among the most frequently measured parameters in wheat breeding and physiology. Although in the recent decades, various wheat grain analyses (e.g. counting, and determining the size, color, or shape features) have been facilitated thanks to the automated image processing systems, MGW estimations has been limited to using few number of image-derived indices; i.e. mainly the linear or power models developed based on the projected area (Area). Following a preliminary observation which indicated the potential of grain width in improving the predictions, the present study was conducted to explore potentially more efficient indices for increasing the precision of image-based MGW estimations. For this purpose, an image archive of the grains was processed, which was harvested from a two-year field experiment carried out with 3 replicates under two irrigation conditions and included 15 cultivar mixture treatments (so the archive was consisted of 180 images taken from an overall number of more than 72000 grains). It was observed that among the more than 30 evaluated indices of grain size and shape, indicators of grain width (i.e. Minor & MinFeret) along with 8 other empirical indices had a higher correlation with MGW, compared with Area. The most precise MGW predictions were obtained using the AreaxCircularity, PerimeterxCircularity, and Area/Perimeter indices. In general, two main common factors were detected in the structure of the major indices, i.e. either grain width or the Area/Perimeter ratio. Moreover, comparative efficiency of the superior indices almost remained stable across the 4 environmental conditions. Eventually, using the selected indices, ten simple linear models were developed and validated for MGW prediction, which indicated a relatively higher precision than the current Area-based models. The considerable effect of enhancing image resolution on the precision of the models has been also evidenced. It is expected that the findings of the present study improve the precision of the image-based MGW estimations, and consequently facilitate wheat breeding and physiological assessments.",

Here we assess the movement and space use of the highly venomous and medically important Malayan krait (Bungarus candidus) on a suburban university campus. We radio- tracked 14 kraits for an average of 114 days (min: 19, max: 218), with an average of 106 fixes (min: 21, max: 229). We assessed movement pathways and activity with dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement models, evaluated patterns of revisitation to identify site fidelity, and determined whether individuals selected for particular land-use types with Integrated Step Selection Functions. Most individuals displayed some level of attraction to buildings (n = 10) and natural areas (n = 12); we identified a similar unambiguous pattern of attraction to buildings and natural areas at the population level (of our sample). Snakes remained in shelter sites for long periods of time (max = 94 days) and revisited sites on average every 15.45 days. Over 50% of fixes were within human settlements and 37.1% were associated with buildings. We found generally seasonal patterns of activity, with higher activity in wet seasons (when classes are typically in session on campus), and lower activity in the hot season (when there are a number of short breaks causing students to leave campus). These results show frequent proximity between Malayan kraits and humans at Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand; thereby, suggesting a near constant potential for human- wildlife conflict. Despite the fact that no snakebites from this species occurred at the university during our study period, substantial education and awareness training should be considered to raise awareness to ensure continued coexistence on campus.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Galvanotaxis describes the functional response of organisms to electric fields. In ciliates, the electric field influences the electrophysiology and thus the cilia beat dynamics. This leads to a change of the swimming direction towards the cathode. The dynamical response to electric fields of Coleps hirtus has not been studied since the observations of Verworn in 1890 (1). While galvanotaxis has been studied in other cilitates, C. hirtus exhibit properties not found elsewhere, such as biomineralization-processes of alveolar plates with impact on the intracellular calcium regulation and a bimodal resting membrane potential, which leads unique electrophysiological driven bimodal swimming dynamics. Here, we statistically analyze the galvanotactic dynamics of C. hirtus by automated cell tracking routines. We found that the number of cells that show a galvanotactic response, increases with the increase of the applied electric field strength with a mean at about 2.1 V/cm. The spatiotemporal swimming dynamics change and lead to a statistical increase of linear elongated cell trajectories that point toward the cathode. Further, the increase of the electric fields decreases the mean velocity variance for electric fields larger than about 1.3 V/cm, while showing no significant change in the absolute velocity for any applied electric field. Fully functional galvanotactic responses were observed at a minimum extracellular calcium concentration of 20 {micro}M. The results add important insights to the current understanding of cellular dynamics of ciliates and suggest that the currently accepted model lags the inclusion of the swimming dynamics and the complex calcium regulatory system of the cell. The results of this study do not only extend the fundamental understanding of C. hirtus dynamics, but also open possibilities for technical applications, such as biosensors or microrobots in the future.",

Here, this study proposes DeepBioGen, a sequencing profile augmentation procedure that characterizes visual patterns of sequencing profiles, generates realistic profiles based on a deep generative model capturing the patterns, and generalizes the subsequent classifiers. DeepBioGen outperforms other methods in terms of enhancing the generalizability of the prediction models on unseen data.

This centrosome \"maturation\" requires the centrioles and also Polo/PLK1 protein kinase. The PCM comprises several hundred proteins and, in Drosophila, Polo cooperates with the conserved centrosome proteins Spd-2/CEP192 and Cnn/CDK5RAP2 to assemble a PCM scaffold around the mother centriole that then recruits other PCM client proteins. We show here that in Drosophila syncytial blastoderm embryos, centrosomal Polo levels rise and fall during the assembly process--peaking, and then starting to decline, even as levels of the PCM scaffold continue to rise and plateau. Experiments and mathematical modelling indicate that a centriolar pulse of Polo activity, potentially generated by the interaction between Polo and its centriole receptor Ana1 (CEP295 in humans), could explain these unexpected scaffold assembly dynamics. We propose that centrioles generate a local pulse of Polo activity prior to mitotic entry to initiate centrosome maturation, explaining why centrioles and Polo/PLK1 are normally essential for this process.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In contrast to ecological speciation, where reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of divergent natural selection, speciation by parallel natural selection has been less thoroughly studied. To test whether parallel evolution drives speciation, we leveraged the repeated evolution of benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine stickleback fish and estimated fitness for pure crosses and within-ecotype hybrids in semi-natural ponds and in laboratory aquaria. In ponds, we detected hybrid breakdown in both ecotypes but this was counterbalanced by heterosis and the strength of post-zygotic isolation was nil. In aquaria, we detected heterosis only in limnetic crosses and breakdown in neither ecotype, suggesting that hybrid incompatibilities are environment-dependent for both ecotypes and that heterosis is environment-dependent in benthic crosses. Heterosis and breakdown were 3x greater in limnetic crosses than in benthic crosses, contrasting the prediction that the fitness consequences of hybridization should be greater in crosses among more derived ecotypes. Consistent with a primary role for stochastic processes, patterns differed among crosses between populations from different lakes. Yet, we observed qualitatively similar patterns of heterosis and hybrid breakdown in benthic crosses and limnetic crosses when averaging the lake pairs, suggesting that the outcome of hybridization is repeatable in a general sense.",

However, it remains unclear how epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation can contribute to multigenerational acclimation and adaptation to environmental stressors. Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), an economically important salmonid, is highly sensitive to thermal stress, and is of conservation concern in the context of climate change. We studied the effects of temperature during parental sexual maturation and offspring rearing on whole-genome DNA methylation in brook charr juveniles (fry). Parents were split between warm and cold temperatures during sexual maturation, mated in controlled breeding designs, then offspring from each family were split between warm (8{degrees}C) and cold (5{degrees}C) rearing environments. We found 188 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) due to parental maturation temperature after controlling for family structure. In contrast, offspring rearing temperature had a negligible effect on offspring methylation. Stable intergenerational inheritance of DNA methylation and minimal plasticity in progeny could result in transmission of acclimatory epigenetic states to offspring, priming them for a warming environment. Our findings have implications pertaining to the role of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance in response to ongoing climate change.",

Septin 7 (Sept7) is enriched at the base of dendritic spines in excitatory neurons and mediates both spine formation and spine-synapse maturation. Phosphorylation at a conserved C-terminal tail residue of Sept7 mediates its translocation into the dendritic spine head to allow spine-synapse maturation. The mechanistic basis for postsynaptic stability and compartmentalization conferred by phosphorylated Sept7, however, is not known. We report herein the proteomic identification of Sept7 phosphorylation dependent neuronal interactors. Using Sept7 C-terminal phosphopeptide pulldown and biochemical assays, we show that the 14-3-3 family of proteins specifically interact with Sept7 when phosphorylated at the T426 residue. Biochemically, we validate the interaction between Sept7 and 14-3-3 isoform gamma, and show that 14-3-3 gamma is also enriched in mature dendritic spine head. Further, we demonstrate that interaction of phosphorylated Sept7 with 14-3-3 protects it from dephosphorylation, as expression of a 14-3-3 antagonist significantly decreases phosphorylated Sept7 in neurons. This study identifies 14-3-3 proteins as an important physiological regulator of Sept7 function in neuronal development.",

Contemporary treatment modalities have been associated with various complications. Encouraged from the recent marked antimalarial effects from plant derived glycosides; here we have chemically synthesized a library of diverse Glycoside derivatives (Gly 1-12) and evaluated their inhibitory efficacy against Ag83 strain of Leishmania donovani. In vitro activity of Glycoside-2 (Gly 2) on promastigote form of Ag83 strain, unravelled its prominent anti-leishmanial property with IC50 value of 1.13M. In-silico studies also unveiled the efficacy of Gly 2 to bind to the membrane surface of parasite. The toxic effect of Gly 2 causes necrosis like death in promastigote by abrogating its proliferation leading to imbalanced redox homeostasis by disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, Gly 2 treatment demonstrated increased susceptibility of parasites towards complement mediated lysis and displayed strong lethal effect on amastigote-macrophage infection model mimicking pathophysiological condition of body. This lead molecule was quite effective against the clinical on promastigotes form of PKDL strain BS12 with IC50 value of 1.97 M making it the most suitable drug so far which can target both VL and PKDL simultaneously. Based on the above experimental validations we narrowed our thoughts regarding the potent role of Gly 2 targeting surface protein of L. donovani such as Gp63, a zinc metalloprotease. Further analysis of structure activity relationship (SAR) of these glycoside derivatives, demonstrated exceptional binding affinity of Gly 2 towards Gp63, a zinc metalloprotease of L. donovani; with strong H-bond interactions of Gly 2 with catalytic domain in the -helix B region of Gp63. The strong confined interactions between Gly 2 and the target protein Gp63 in a physiologically relevant cellular environment was further assessed by Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) which corroborated with our previous results. Taken together, this study reports the serendipitous discovery of glycoside derivative Gly 2 with enhanced leishmanicidal activity and proves to be novel chemotherapeutic prototype against VL and PKDL.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA novel glycoside derivative (Gly 2) targets Gp63 functioning in L. donovani promastigotes, resulting in its abrogated proliferation and severely detabilized redox homeostasis, leading to parasitic death.\nC_LIO_LIStructure activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed exceptional ligandability of Gly 2 towards Gp63 catalytic domain both in silico and in Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) based in vitro analysis.\nC_LIO_LIGly 2 treatment exhibited increased parasite susceptibility towards complement mediated lysis and reduced macrophage infection in vitro mimicking the pathophysiological conditions.\nC_LIO_LIGly 2 showed profound antileishmanial activity against the clinical isolates of Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL).\nC_LI",

This increase in opioid misuse affects all demographics of society, including women of child-bearing age, which has led to a rise in opioid use during pregnancy. Opioid use during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of obstetric complications and adverse neonatal outcomes, including neonatal abstinence syndrome. Currently, opioid use disorder in pregnant women is treated with long-acting opioid agonists, including buprenorphine. Although buprenorphine reduces illicit opioid use during pregnancy and improves infant outcomes at birth, few long-term studies of the neurodevelopmental consequences have been conducted. The goal of the current experiments was to examine the effects of buprenorphine on the development of the cortex using fetal brain tissue, 3D brain cultures, and rodent models. First, we demonstrated that we can grow cortical and subpallial spheroids, which model the cellular diversity, connectivity, and activity of the developing human brain. Next, we show that cells in the developing human cortex express the nociceptin opioid (NOP) receptor and that buprenorphine can signal through this receptor in cortical spheroids. Using subpallial spheroids to grow inhibitory interneurons, we show that buprenorphine can alter interneuron development and migration into the cortex. Finally, using a rodent model of prenatal buprenorphine exposure, we demonstrate that alterations in interneuron distribution can persist into adulthood. Together, these results suggest that more research is needed into the long-lasting consequences of buprenorphine exposure on the developing human brain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "There is an urgent need for new antifungals to treat cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, a leading cause of mortality in people living with HIV/AIDS. An important aspect of antifungal drug development is the validation of targets to determine whether they are required for the survival of the organism in animal models of disease. In Cryptococcus neoformans, a copper-regulated promoter (pCTR4-2) has been used to modulate gene expression in vivo previously. The premise for these experiments is that copper concentrations vary depending on the host niche. Here, we directly test this premise and confirm that the expression of CTR4, the promoter used to regulate gene expression, is much lower in the mouse lung compared to the brain. To further explore this approach, we applied to the gene encoding 1,3-{beta}-glucan synthase, FKS1. In vitro, reduced expression of FKS1 has little effect on growth but does activate the cell wall integrity stress response and increase susceptibility to caspofungin, a direct inhibitor of Fks1. These data suggest that compensatory pathways that reduce C. neoformans resistance do so through post-transcriptional effects. In vivo, however, a less pronounced reduction in FKS1 expression leads to a much more significant reduction in lung fungal burden (~1 log10 CFU), indicating that the compensatory responses to a reduction in FKS1 expression are not as effective in vivo as they are in vitro. In summary, use of copper-regulated expression of putative drug targets in vitro and in vivo can provide insights into the biological consequences of reduced activity of the target during infection.\n\nImportanceConditional expression systems are widely used to genetically validate antifungal drug targets in mouse models of infection. Copper-regulated expression using the promoter of the CTR4 gene has been sporadically used for this purpose in C. neoformans. Here, we show that CTR4 expression is low in the lung and high in the brain, establishing the basic premise behind this approach. We applied it to the study of FKS1, the gene encoding for the target of the echinocandin class of 1,3-{beta}-glucan synthase inhibitors. Our in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that C. neoformans tolerates extremely low levels of FKS1 expression. This observation provides a potential explanation for the poor activity of 1,3-{beta}-glucan synthase inhibitors toward C. neoformans.",

Thus, using eRNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pause release as a model, we examined the requirement of sequence, structure and length of eRNAs for their ability to stimulate Pol II pause release by detaching NELF from paused Pol II. We found eRNA not to exert their function through common structural or sequence motifs. Instead, efficient NELF release requires a single eRNA molecule that must contain unpaired guanosines to make multiple, allosteric contacts with several NELF subunits. By revealing the molecular determinants for eRNA function, our study mechanistically links eRNAs to Pol II pause release and provides new insight into the regulation of metazoan transcription.",

Here, we describe a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identified DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in human cells. Basal expression of DAXX was sufficient to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, and DAXX over-expression further restricted infection. In contrast with most of its previously described antiviral activities, DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 was independent of the SUMOylation pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites and promoted its degradation. Mechanistically, this process was mediated by the viral papain-like protease (PLpro) and the proteasome. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX restricts SARS-CoV-2, which in turn has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.",

These life cycle phases of each species appear to have distinct spatial and temporal distributions in the oceans, with the heavily-calcified heterococcolithophores (HET) often more prevalent in winter and at greater depths, whilst the lightly-calcified holococcolithophores (HOL) are more abundant in summer and in shallower waters. The haplo-diplontic life cycle may therefore allow coccolithophores to expand their ecological niche, switching between life cycle phases to exploit conditions that are more favourable. However, coccolithophore life cycles remain poorly understood and fundamental information on the physiological differences between life cycle phases is required if we are to better understand the ecophysiology of coccolithophores. In this study, we have examined the physiology of HET and HOL phases of the coccolithophore Coccolithus braarudii in response to changes in light and nutrient availability. We found that the HOL phase was more tolerant to high light than the HET phase, which exhibited defects in calcification at high irradiances. The HET phase exhibited defects in coccolith formation under both nitrate (N) and phosphate (P) limitation, whilst no defects in calcification were detected in the HOL phase. The HOL phase grew to a higher cell density under P-limitation than N-limitation, whereas no difference was observed in the maximum cell density reached by the HET phase at these nutrient concentrations. HET cells grown under a light:dark cycle divided primarily in the dark and early part of the light phase, whereas HOL cells continued to divide throughout the 24 h period. The physiological differences may contribute to the distinct biogeographical distributions observed between life cycle phases, with the HOL phase potentially better adapted to high light, low nutrient regimes, such as those found in seasonally stratified surface waters.\n\nHighlightsO_LICoccolithus braarudii life cycle phases exhibit different physiological responses.\nC_LIO_LIThe heavily-calcified heterococcolithophores (HET) life cycle phase is more sensitive to high light.\nC_LIO_LIThe lightly-calcified holococcolithophores (HOL) life cycle phase may be better suited to growth under low phosphate availability.\nC_LI",

However, identifying signatures of divergence in homomorphic sex chromosomes can be challenging due to high levels of sequence similarity between the X and the Y. Variations in methodological precision and underlying data can make all the difference between detecting subtle divergence patterns or missing them entirely. Recent efforts to test for X-Y sequence differentiation in the guppy have led to contradictory results. Here we apply different analytical methodologies to the same dataset to test for the accuracy of different approaches in identifying patterns of sex chromosome divergence in the guppy. Our comparative analysis reveals that the most substantial source of variation in the results of the different analyses lies in the reference genome used. Analyses using custom-made de novo genome assemblies for the focal species successfully recover a signal of divergence across different methodological approaches. By contrast, using the distantly related Xiphophorus reference genome results in variable patterns, due to both sequence evolution and structural variations on the sex chromosomes between the guppy and Xiphophorus. Changes in mapping and filtering parameters can additionally introduce noise and obscure the signal. Our results illustrate how analytical differences can alter perceived results and we highlight best practices for the study of nascent sex chromosomes.",

We address this problem by using a parallelized Bayesian filter to specify hidden Markov models for current and fluorescence data. We demonstrate the flexibility of this algorithm by including different noise distributions. Our generalized Kalman filter outperforms both a classical Kalman filter and a rate equation approach when applied to patch-clamp data exhibiting realistic open-channel noise. The derived generalization also enables inclusion of orthogonal fluorescence data, making unidentifiable parameters identifiable and increasing the accuracy of the parameter estimates by an order of magnitude. By using Bayesian highest credibility volumes, we found that our approach, in contrast to the rate equation approach, yields a realistic quantification of uncertainty. Furthermore, the Bayesian filter delivers unbiased estimates for a wider range of data quality and identifies parameters which the rate equation approach does not identify. These results also demonstrate the power of assessing the validity of algorithms by Bayesian credibility volumes in general. Finally, we show that our Bayesian filter is more robust against errors induced by either analog filtering before analog-to-digital conversion or by limited time resolution of fluorescence data than a rate equation approach.",

The fused brain organoids were engrafted with robust vascular network-like structures, and exhibited increased number of neural progenitors, in line with the possibility that vessels regulate neural development. Fusion organoids also contained functional blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-like structures, as well as microglial cells, a specific population of immune cells in the brain. The incorporated microglia responded actively to immune stimuli to the fused brain organoids.

    "preprint_abstract": "Age-dependent loss of body wall muscle function and impaired locomotion occur within 2 weeks in C. elegans; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In humans, age-dependent loss of muscle function occurs at about 80 years of age and has been linked to dysfunction of ryanodine receptor (RyR)/intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Mammalian skeletal muscle RyR1 channels undergo age-related remodeling due to oxidative overload, leading to loss of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel macromolecular complex. This destabilizes the closed state of the channel resulting in intracellular Ca2+ leak, reduced muscle function, and impaired exercise capacity. We now show that the C. elegans RyR homolog, UNC-68, exhibits a remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation with mammalian RyR channels and similar age-dependent dysfunction. Like RyR1 in mammals UNC-68 encodes a protein that comprises a macromolecular complex which includes the calstabin1 homolog FKB-2 and is immunoreactive with antibodies raised against the RyR1 complex. Further, as in aged mammals, UNC-68 is oxidized and depleted of FKB-2 in an age-dependent manner, resulting in \"leaky\" channels, depleted SR Ca2+ stores, reduced body wall muscle Ca2+ transients, and age-dependent muscle weakness. FKB-2 (ok3007)-deficient worms exhibit reduced exercise capacity. Pharmacologically induced oxidization of UNC-68 and depletion of FKB-2 from the channel independently caused reduced body wall muscle Ca2+ transients. Preventing FKB-2 depletion from the UNC-68 macromolecular complex using the Rycal drug S107 improved muscle Ca2+ transients and function. Taken together, these data suggest that UNC-68 oxidation plays a role in age-dependent loss of muscle function. Remarkably, this age-dependent loss of muscle function induced by oxidative overload, which takes ~2 years in mice and ~80 years in humans, occurs in less than 2-3 weeks in C. elegans, suggesting that reduced anti-oxidant capacity may contribute to the differences in life span amongst species.",

Suppressor tRNAs have long been identified as a possible therapeutic for nonsense-associated diseases, however their ability to inhibit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and support significant protein translation from endogenous transcripts has not been determined in mammalian cells. Here we investigated the ability of anticodon edited (ACE)-tRNAs to suppress cystic fibrosis (CF) causing PTCs in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene in gene-edited immortalized human bronchial epithelial (16HBEge) cells. Delivery of ACE-tRNAs to 16HBEge cells harboring three common CF mutations G542X-, R1162X- and W1282X-CFTR PTCs significantly inhibited NMD and rescued endogenous mRNA expression. Furthermore, delivery of our highly active leucine encoding ACE-tRNA resulted in rescue of W1282X-CFTR channel function to levels that significantly exceed the necessary CFTR channel function for therapeutic relevance. This study establishes the ACE-tRNA approach as a potential stand-alone therapeutic for nonsense-associated diseases due to its ability to rescue both mRNA and full-length protein expression from PTC containing endogenous genes.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySuppression of endogenous CFTR nonsense mutations by anticodon engineered tRNAs significantly increases mRNA expression and channel function.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Although Escherichia coli K-12 strains represent perhaps the best known model bacteria, we do not know the identity or functions of all of their transcription factors (TFs). It is now possible to systematically discover the physiological function of TFs in E. coli BW25113 using a set of synergistic methods; including ChIP-exo, growth phenotyping, conserved gene clustering, and transcriptome analysis. Among 47 LysR-type TFs (LTFs) found on the E. coli K-12 genome, many regulate nitrogen source utilization or amino acid metabolism. However, 19 LTFs remain unknown. In this study, we elucidated the regulation of seven of these 19 LTFs: YbdO, YbeF, YgfI, YiaU, YneJ, YcaN, YbhD. We show that: 1) YbdO regulation has an effect on bacterial growth at low pH with citrate supplementation. YbdO is a repressor of the ybdNM operon and is implicated in the regulation of citrate lyase genes (citCDEFG); 2) YgfI activates the dhaKLM operon that encodes the phosphotransferase system involved in glycerol and dihydroxyacetone utilization; 3) YiaU regulates the yiaT gene encoding an outer membrane protein, and waaPSBOJYZU operon is also important in determining cell density at the stationary phase; 4) YneJ, re-named here as PtrR, directly regulates the expression of the succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, Sad (also known as YneI), and is a predicted regulator of fnrS (a small RNA molecule). PtrR is important for bacterial growth in the presence of L-glutamate and putrescine as nitrogen sources; and 5) YbhD and YcaN regulate adjacent y-genes on the genome and YbeF is involved in flagella gene regulation. We have thus established the functions for four LTFs and identified the target genes for three LTFs.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe reconstruction of the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) is important for gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli. LysR-type TFs are abundant in Enterobacteria, but many LTF functions still remain unknown. Here we report putative functions of uncharacterized TFs based on multi-omics data related to L-threonine, L-glutamate, and putrescine utilization. Amino acids (AAs) and polyamines are important sources of nitrogen for many microorganisms, but the increase in one amino acid or putrescine concentration in a minimal medium also induces stress. Although polyamine metabolism has been studied, the TRN that controls the putrescine (Ptr) and AA utilization at minimal medium conditions are still poorly understood. The function of previously uncharacterized transcriptional regulators YbdO, YgfI, and YneJ (PtrR) were identified in Escherichia coli. PtrR is important for Ptr and L-glutamate utilization, while YgfI transcriptional regulation was found to be important for growth on L-threonine and glycerol as a carbon source.",

We investigated the role of REM sleep in ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in layer 2/3 neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging in awake CP mice. In contrast to findings in layer 5 neurons, we find that REM sleep promotes changes consistent with synaptic strengthening and weakening. This supports recent suggestions that the effects of sleep on plasticity are highly dependent upon the type of circuit and preceding waking experience.",

We demonstrate that aminoglycosides block an early step of the viral life cycle, prior to genome replication. Phage inhibition was also achieved using supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers, hinting at a broad physiological significance of the antiviral properties of aminoglycosides. Strikingly, we show that acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic apramycin abolishes its antibacterial effect, but retains its antiviral properties. Altogether, this study expands the knowledge of potential aminoglycoside functions in bacterial communities suggesting that aminoglycosides are not only used by their producers as toxic molecules against their bacterial competitors, but could also provide protection against the threat of phage predation at the community level.",

    "preprint_abstract": "De novo designed receptor transmembrane domains (TMDs) present opportunities for precise control of cellular receptor functions. We developed a de novo design strategy for generating programmed membrane proteins (proMPs): single-pass -helical TMDs that self-assemble through computationally defined and crystallographically validated interfaces. We used these proMPs to program specific oligomeric interactions into a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and found that both in vitro CAR T cell cytokine release and in vivo antitumor activity scaled linearly with the oligomeric state encoded by the receptor TMD, from monomers up to tetramers. All programmed CARs (proCARs) stimulated substantially lower T cell cytokine release relative to the commonly used CD28 TMD, which we show elevated cytokine release through lateral recruitment of the endogenous T cell costimulatory receptor CD28. Precise design using orthogonal and modular TMDs thus provides a new way to program receptor structure and predictably tune activity for basic or applied synthetic biology.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacterial surface appendages called type IVa pili (T4aP) promote diverse activities including DNA uptake, twitching motility, and virulence. These activities rely on the ability of T4aP to dynamically extend and retract from the cell surface. Dynamic extension relies on a motor ATPase commonly called PilB. Most T4aP also rely on specific motor ATPases, commonly called PilT and PilU, to dynamically and forcefully retract. Here, we systematically assess whether motor ATPases from three orthologous T4aP can functionally complement Vibrio cholerae mutants that lack their endogenous motors. We found that the PilT and PilU retraction ATPases from the three T4aP systems tested are promiscuous and promote retraction of the V. cholerae competence T4aP despite a high degree of sequence divergence. In contrast, the orthologous extension ATPases from the same T4aP systems were not able to mediate extension of the V. cholerae competence T4aP despite exhibiting a similar degree of sequence divergence. Also, we show that one of the PilT orthologs characterized does not support PilU-dependent retraction and provide some data to indicate that the C-terminus of PilT is important for PilU-dependent retraction. Together, our data suggest that retraction ATPases may have maintained a high degree of promiscuity for promoting retraction of T4aP, while extension ATPases may have evolved to become specific for their cognate systems.\n\nIMPORTANCEOne way that bacteria interact with their environments is via hair-like appendages called type IVa pili (T4aP). These appendages dynamically extend and retract from the cell surface via the action of distinct ATPase motors. T4aP are present in diverse bacterial species. Here, we demonstrate that retraction motors from three T4aP are promiscuous, and capable of promoting retraction of a heterologous T4aP system. By contrast, the extension ATPase motors from these same T4aP systems are specific and cannot promote extension of a heterologous T4aP. Thus, these results suggest that T4aP extension may be more tightly regulated compared to T4aP retraction.",

    "preprint_abstract": "During sporulation, Bacillus subtilis undergoes an atypical cell division that requires overriding mechanisms which protect chromosomes from damage and ensure inheritance by daughter cells. Instead of assembling between segregated chromosomes at midcell, the FtsZ-ring (Z-ring) coalesces polarly, directing division over one chromosome. The DNA-binding protein RefZ facilitates the timely assembly of polar Z-rings and partially defines the region of chromosome initially captured in the forespore. RefZ binds to motifs (RBMs) located proximal to the origin of replication (oriC). Although refZ and the RBMs are conserved across the Bacillus genus, a refZ deletion mutant sporulates with wildtype efficiency, so the functional significance of RefZ during sporulation remains unclear. To further investigate RefZ function, we performed a candidate-based screen for synthetic sporulation defects by combining {Delta}refZ with deletions of genes previously implicated in FtsZ regulation and/or chromosome capture. Combining {Delta}refZ with deletions of ezrA, sepF, parA, or minD did not detectably affect sporulation. In contrast, a {Delta}refZ {Delta}noc mutant exhibited a sporulation defect, revealing a genetic interaction between RefZ and Noc. Using reporters of sporulation progression, we determined the {Delta}refZ {Delta}noc mutant exhibited sporulation delays after Spo0A activation but prior to late sporulation, with a subset of cells failing to divide polarly or activate the first forespore-specific sigma factor, SigF. The {Delta}refZ {Delta}noc mutant also exhibited extensive dysregulation of cell division, producing cells with extra, misplaced, or otherwise aberrant septa. Our results reveal a previously unknown epistatic relationship that suggests refZ and noc contribute synthetically to regulating cell division and supporting spore development.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe DNA-binding protein RefZ and its binding sites (RBMs) are conserved in sequence and location on the chromosome across the Bacillus genus and contribute to the timing of polar FtsZ-ring assembly during sporulation. Only a small number of non-coding and non-regulatory DNA motifs are known to be conserved in chromosomal position in bacteria, suggesting there is strong selective pressure for their maintenance; however a refZ deletion mutant sporulates efficiently, providing no clues as to their functional significance. Here we find that in the absence of the nucleoid occlusion factor Noc, deletion of refZ results in a sporulation defect characterized by developmental delays and aberrant divisions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Humans develop auditory-motor interaction to produce a variety of rhythmic sounds using body movements, which are often produced and amplified with tools, such as drumming. The extended production of sounds allows us to express a wide range of emotions, accompanied by physiological changes. According to previous studies, even young infants enhance movements in response to auditory feedback. However, their exhibition of physiological adaptation on emergence of auditory-motor interaction is unclear. We investigated the movement and cardiac changes associated with auditory feedback to spontaneous limb movements in 3-month-old infants. The results showed that infants increased the frequency of limb movements inducing auditory feedback, while they exhibited the more regular rhythm of the limb movements. Furthermore, heart rate increase associated with the limb movement was first inhibited immediately after the timing of the auditory feedback, which may reflect sustained attention to the auditory stimuli. Then, through auditory-motor experience, the heart rate increase was inhibited even prior to the auditory feedback, leading to suppression on the peak intensity of the heart rate increase. These findings suggest that young infants regulate the cardiovascular system as well as limb movements in anticipation of the auditory feedback. The anticipatory regulation associated with movement and attentional changes may contribute to reduced cardiovascular stress in auditory-motor interaction, and provide a developmental basis for more sophisticated goal-directed behavior of producing rhythmic sounds.",

In order to longitudinally track SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in people after vaccination or infection, a large-scale COVID-19 sero-surveillance progam entitled SPARTA (SeroPrevalence and Respiratory Tract Assessment) was established early in the pandemic. Anti-RBD antibody levels were tracked in more than 1,000 people. There was no significant decrease in antibody levels during the first 14 months after infection in unvaccinated participants, however, significant waning of antibody levels was observed following vaccination, regardless of previous infection status. Moreover, participants who were pre-immune to SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination seroconverted to significantly higher antibody levels, and antibodies were maintained at significantly higher levels than in previously infected, unvaccinated participants. This pattern was entirely due to differences in the magnitude of the initial seroconversion event, and the rate of antibody waning was not significantly different based on the pre-immune status. Participants who received a third (booster) dose of an mRNA vaccine not only increased their anti-RBD antibody levels [~]14-fold, but they also had [~]3 times more anti-RBD antibodies compared to the peak of their antibody levels after receiving their primary vaccine series. In order to ascertain whether the presence of serum antibodies is important for long-term seroprotection, PBMCs from 13 participants who lost all detectable circulating antibodies after vaccination or infection were differentiated into memory cells in vitro. There was a significant recall of memory B cells in the absence of serum antibodies in 70% of the vaccinated participants, but not in any of the infected participants. Therefore, there is a strong connection between anti-RBD antibody levels and the effectiveness of memory B cell recall.",

Vaccine development and mobilization against SARS-CoV-2 (the etiologic agent of COVID-19) has been rapid. However, novel strategies are still necessary to slow the pandemic, and this includes new approaches to vaccine development and/or delivery, which improve vaccination compliance and demonstrate efficacy against emerging variants. Here we report on the immunogenicity and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprised of stabilized, pre-fusion Spike protein trimers displayed on a ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) adjuvanted with either conventional aluminum hydroxide or the Army Liposomal Formulation QS-21 (ALFQ) in a cynomolgus macaque COVID-19 model. Vaccination resulted in robust cell-mediated and humoral responses and a significant reduction of lung lesions following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The strength of the immune response suggests that dose sparing through reduced or single dosing in primates may be possible with this vaccine. Overall, the data support further evaluation of SpFN as a SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine candidate with attention to fractional dosing and schedule optimization.",

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the diversity of coat colors and their inheritance is important for professional breeders because it helps to predict the phenotypes of the progeny. Although genetics of the main coat colors in dogs is extensively studied, there are types of coat pigmentation that are not explained yet. Recently a new model connected the variants in ASIP gene promoters with different coat colors in dogs. Here we used this model as a framework to investigate the genetics of the rare sesame coat color in Shiba Inu dogs. We determined the combination of two alleles of ASIP gene that determine sesame coat color. This finding can be used by the breeders to produce the dogs with this rare coat color pattern. We also demonstrate the incomplete dominance between the ASIP alleles involved in sesame coat formation. These results are in good agreement with the new model explaining how different levels of ASIP gene expression affect the regulation of pigment synthesis in melanocytes.",

The fetal liver is also the unique anatomical site where hematopoietic stem cells expand before colonizing the bone marrow, where they ensure life-long blood cell production and become mostly resting. The identification of the different cell types that comprise the hematopoietic stroma in the fetal liver is essential to understand the signals required for the expansion and differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cells. We used a panel of monoclonal antibodies to identify fetal liver stromal cells in a 5-laser equipped spectral flow cytometry analyzer. The \"Autofluorescence Finder\" of SONY ID7000 software identified two distinct autofluorescence emission spectra. Using autofluorescence as a fluorescence parameter we could assign the two autofluorescent signals to three distinct cell types and identified surface markers that characterize these populations. We found that one autofluorescent population corresponds to hepatoblasts and cholangiocytes whereas the other expresses mesenchymal transcripts and was identified as stellate cells. Importantly, after birth, autofluorescence becomes the unique identifying property of hepatoblasts because mature cholangiocytes are no longer autofluorescent.\n\nThese results show that autofluorescence used as a parameter in spectral flow cytometry is a useful tool to identify new cell subsets that are difficult to analyze in conventional flow cytometry.",

Strikingly, the combined loss of FOXO1 and FOXO3 resulted in the failure to restrict the myeloid potential of CLPs and the complete loss of the B cell lineage. This is underpinned by the failure to enforce the early B-lineage gene regulatory circuitry upon a predominantly pre-established open chromatin landscape. Altogether, this demonstrates that FOXO3 and FOXO1 cooperatively govern early lineage restriction and initiation of B-lineage commitment in CLPs.\n\nSUMMARYCommon lymphoid progenitors co-express the transcription factors FOXO1 and FOXO3.

We use an occupancy modeling framework to develop a new model, the multi-state diel occupancy model (MSDOM), which can evaluate species diel activity against continuous response variables which may impact diel activity within and across seasons or years. We used two case studies, fosa in Madagascar and coyote in Chicago, USA, to conceptualize the application of this model and to quantify the impacts of human activity on species spatial use in diel time. We found support that both species varied their habitat use by diel states--in and across years, and by human disturbance. Our results exemplify the importance of understanding animal diel activity patterns and how human disturbance can lead to temporal habitat loss.

To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated optogenetically and electrically layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals from both sexes, replicating in vitro an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles in vivo. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we find that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increase their correlation in spontaneous activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Unexpectedly, optogenetic and electrical stimulation-induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reduction in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance can revert this effect. These significant increases in excitability may partly explain the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We propose that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an \"iceberg\" model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.\n\nSignificance StatementWe investigated the synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of neuronal ensembles, i.e., spontaneously coactive groups of neurons. Using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetic in slices of mouse neocortex we replicated a protocol that generates ensembles in vivo. After optogenetic and electrical stimulation, we observed biphasic synaptic plasticity and, unexpectedly, major increases in excitability, input resistance, and reductions in firing threshold. The increased excitability can explain the observed synaptic plasticity. Our results reveal a major role for intrinsic excitability in the establishment of neuronal ensembles.",

Although most prominent in adult peripheral vision, crowding also disrupts foveal vision in typically-developing children and those with strabismic amblyopia. Do these crowding effects share the same mechanism? Here we exploit observations that crowded errors in peripheral vision are not random: target objects appear either averaged with the flankers (assimilation), or replaced by them (substitution). If amblyopic and developmental crowding share the same mechanism then their errors should be similarly systematic. We tested foveal vision in children aged 3-8 years with typical vision or strabismic amblyopia, and peripheral vision in typical adults. The perceptual effects of crowding were measured by requiring observers to adjust a reference stimulus to match the perceived orientation of a target  Vac-Man element. When the target was surrounded by flankers that differed by {+/-}30{degrees}, all three groups (adults and children with typical or amblyopic vision) reported orientations between the target and flankers (assimilation). Errors were reduced with {+/-}90{degrees} differences, but primarily matched the flanker orientation (substitution) when they did occur. A population pooling model of crowding successfully simulated this pattern of errors in all three groups. We conclude that the perceptual effects of amblyopic and developing crowding are systematic and resemble the near periphery in adults, suggesting a common underlying mechanism.\n\nPrecisCrowding strongly disrupts peripheral vision, as well as the foveal vision of children with typical vision and amblyopia. We show that typically developing and amblyopic children make the same crowded errors as adults in the visual periphery, consistent with a common mechanism in all three cases.",

The mechanisms through which p53 promotes downstream tumor suppressive gene expression programs remain, however, only superficially understood. Here, we used tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to reveal new components of the p53 response. This approach uncovered Mettl3, a component of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex (MTC), as a p53-interacting protein. Analysis of Mettl3- deficient cells revealed that Mettl3 promotes p53 protein stabilization and target gene expression in response to DNA damage. Mettl3 acts in part by competing with the p53 negative regulator, Mdm2, for binding to the p53 transactivation domains to promote methyltransferase-independent stabilization of p53. In addition, Mettl3 relies on its catalytic activity to augment p53 responses, with p53 recruiting Mettl3 to p53 target genes to co-transcriptionally direct m6A modification of p53 pathway transcripts to enhance their expression. Mettl3 also promotes p53 activity downstream of oncogenic signals in vivo, in both allograft and autochthonous lung adenocarcinoma models, suggesting cooperative action of p53 and Mettl3 in tumor suppression. Accordingly, we found in diverse human cancers that mutations in MTC components perturb expression of p53 target genes and that MTC mutations are mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations, suggesting that the MTC enhances the p53 transcriptional program in human cancer. Together, these studies reveal a fundamental role for Mettl3 in amplifying p53 signaling through protein stabilization and epitranscriptome regulation.",

A subset of oncogenic driver mutations results in neomorphic activity where the mutant protein mediates functions not engaged by the parental molecule. Here, we identify prevalent variant-enabled neomorph-protein-protein interactions (neoPPI) with a quantitative High Throughput differential Screening (qHT-dS) platform. Coupling of highly sensitive BRET biosensors with miniaturized co-expression in an ultra-HTS format allows large-scale monitoring of interactions of wild-type and mutant variant counterparts with a library of cancer-associated proteins in live cells. Screening of 13,392 interactions with 1,474,560 data points revealed a landscape of gain-of-interactions encompassing both oncogenic and tumor suppressor mutations. For example, the recurrent BRAF V600E lesion mediates KEAP1 neoPPI, rewiring a BRAFV600E-KEAP1 signaling axis and creating collateral vulnerability to NQO1 substrates, offering a combination therapeutic strategy. Thus, cancer genomic alterations can create neo-interactions, informing variant-directed therapeutic approaches for precision medicine.",

Here, we employed Stereo-seq, a high-definition spatially resolved transcriptomic technology, to dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression and regulatory networks in the developing zebrafish embryos. We profiled 91 embryo sections covering six critical time points during the first 24 hours of development, obtaining a total of 139,391 spots at cellular size ([~]100 m2) with spatial coordinates. Meanwhile, we identified spatial modules and co-varying genes for specific tissue organizations. By performing the integrative analysis of the Stereo-seq and scRNA-seq data from each time point, we reconstructed the spatially resolved developmental trajectories of cell fate transitions and molecular changes during zebrafish embryogenesis. We further investigated the spatial distribution of ligand-receptor pairs for major signaling pathways and identified novel interactions that potentially crosstalk with the Notch signaling pathway during zebrafish development.

All types of locomotion depend on integration of motor commands and sensory information to generate precise movements.

In fish, CSF-cN modulate swimming activity in response to changes in pH and bending of the spinal cord, yet their role in higher vertebrates remains unknown. We used mouse genetics to study their function in quadrupedal locomotion and found that CSF-cN are directly integrated into spinal motor circuits by forming connections with motor neurons and premotor interneurons. Elimination of CSF-cN selectively perturbs the accuracy of foot placement required for skilled movements at the balance beam and horizontal ladder. These results identify an important role for mouse CSF-cN in adaptive motor control and indicate that this sensory system evolved a novel function from lower vertebrates to accommodate the biomechanical requirements of terrestrial locomotion.",

They are molecules composed by a hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, which can present a panoply of various motions, including small localized movements of a few atoms up to the diffusion of the whole lipid or collective motions of many of them. In the past, efforts were made to measure these motions experimentally by incoherent neutron scattering and to quantify them, but with upcoming modern neutron sources and instruments, such models can now be improved. In the present work, we expose a quantitative and exhaustive study of lipid dynamics on DMPC and DMPG membranes, using the Matryoshka model recently developed by our group. The model is confronted here to experimental data collected on two different membrane samples, at three temperatures and two instruments. Despite such complexity, the model describes reliably the data and permits to extract a series of parameters.

Although we have learned a considerable amount about the function of single SC neurons, the way in which sensory information is represented and processed on the population level in awake behaving animals and across a large region of the retinotopic map is still largely unknown. Partially because the SC is anatomically located below the cortical sheet and the transverse sinus, it is technically difficult to measure neuronal activity from a large population of neurons in SC. To address this, we propose a tangential recording configuration using high-density electrode probes (Neuropixels) in mouse SC in vivo that permits a large number of recording sites (~200) accessibility inside the SC circuitry. This approach thereby provides a unique opportunity to measure the activity of SC neuronal populations composing up to ~2 mm of SC tissue and characterized by receptive fields covering an extended region in the visual field. Here we describe how to perform tangential recordings along the anterior-posterior and the medio-lateral axis of the mouse SC in vivo and how to combine this approach with optogenetic tools for cell-type identification on the population level.",

Cereals, like maize (Zea mays L.) are capable of utilizing less than 20% of the applied inorganic phosphate (Pi) - a non-renewable fertilizer resource. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition, transportation and utilization of Pi may lead to strategies to enhance phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) in field crops. In this study, we selected 12 Pi responsive genes in maize and carried out their comparative transcriptional expression in root and leaf tissues of a hydroponically grown Pi stress tolerant maize inbred line HKI-163, under sufficient and deficient Pi conditions. Pi starvation led to significant increase in root length; marked proliferation of root hairs and lesser number of crown roots. Eleven genes were significantly up or down regulated in Pi deficient condition. The putative acid phosphatase, ZmACP5, expression was up regulated by 162.81 and 74.40 fold in root and leaf tissues, respectively. The RNase, ZmRNS1 showed 115 fold up regulation in roots under Pi deprivation. Among the two putative high affinity Pi transporters ZmPht1;4 was found specific to root, whereas ZmPht2 was found to be up regulated in both root and leaf tissues. The genes involved in Pi homeostasis pathway (ZmSIZ1, SPX1 and Pho2) were up regulated in root and leaf. In light of the expression profiling of selected regulatory genes, an updated model of transcriptional regulation under Pi starvation in maize has been proposed.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils is widely studied as a critical factor in the pathology of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Misfolded Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) was the first protein linked to ALS, and non-native SOD1 trimeric oligomers were recently linked to cytotoxicity, while larger oligomers were protective to cells. The balance between trimers and larger aggregates in the process of SOD1 aggregation is, thus, a critical determinant of potential therapeutic approaches to treat ALS. Yet, it is unknown whether these trimeric oligomers are a necessary intermediate for larger aggregate formation or a distinct off-pathway species competing with fibril formation. Depending on the on- or off-pathway scenario of trimer formation, we expect drastically different therapeutic approaches. Here, we show that the toxic SOD1 trimer is an off-pathway intermediate competing with protective fibril formation. We design mutant SOD1 constructs that remain in a trimeric state (super stable trimers) and show that stabilizing the trimeric SOD1 prevents formation of fibrils in vitro and in a motor neuron like cell model (NSC-34). Using size exclusion chromatography we track the aggregation kinetics of purified SOD1 and show direct competition of trimeric SOD1 with larger oligomer and fibril formation. Finally, we show the trimer is structurally independent of both larger soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils using circular dichroism spectroscopy and limited proteolysis.\n\nSignificance StatementProtein aggregation into large insoluble species is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, but recent evidence suggests that smaller soluble aggregates are responsible for neuronal death. Depending on whether these toxic oligomers appear on- or off-pathway to larger aggregates, which is currently unknown, the strategies for pharmaceutic intervention would be drastically different. Here, we determine that stabilizing the trimeric form of SOD1 reduces larger aggregate formation while increasing toxicity to cells. Trimeric and larger aggregate concentrations have a strong negative correlation over time, and the structure of the trimer is significantly different from larger soluble and insoluble aggregates. Our findings show that formation of trimeric SOD1 is directly competing with that of larger aggregates.",

We hypothesize that therapy-induced senescence and senescence progression via bystander effects is a significant cause of this premature ageing phenotype. Accordingly, the study addresses the question whether a short anti-senescence intervention is able to block progression of radiation-induced frailty and disability in a pre-clinical setting.\n\nMale mice were sub-lethally irradiated at 5 months of age and treated (or not) with either a senolytic drug (Navitoclax or dasatinib + quercetin) for 10 days or with the senostatic metformin for 10 weeks. Follow up was for one year. Treatments commencing within a month after irradiation effectively reduced frailty progression (p<0.05) and improved muscle (p<0.01) and liver (p<0.05) function as well as short-term memory (p<0.05) until advanced age with no need for repeated interventions. Senolytic interventions that started late, after radiation-induced premature frailty was manifest, still had beneficial effects on frailty (p<0.05) and short-term memory (p<0.05). Metformin was similarly effective as senolytics. At therapeutically achievable concentrations metformin acted as a senostatic neither via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, nor via improvement of mitophagy or mitochondrial function, but by reducing non-mitochondrial ROS production via NOX4 inhibition in senescent cells.\n\nOur study suggests that the progression of adverse long-term health and quality-of-life effects of radiation exposure, as experienced by cancer survivors, might be rescued by short-term adjuvant anti-senescence interventions.",

We experimentally demonstrate that differences in diauxic lags, which occur as species deplete their own environments and adapt their metabolisms, allow slow-growing microbes to stably coexist with faster-growing species in multi-resource environments despite being excluded in single-resource environments. In our focal example, an Acinetobacter species (Aci2) competitively excludes Pseudomonas aurantiaca (Pa) on alanine and on glutamate. However, they coexist on the combination of both resources. Experiments reveal that Aci2 grows faster but Pa has shorter diauxic lags. We establish a tradeoff between Aci2s fast growth and Pas short lags as their mechanism for coexistence. We model this tradeoff to accurately predict how environmental changes affect community composition. We extend our work by surveying a large set of competitions and observe coexistence nearly three times as frequently when the slow-grower is the fast-switcher. Our work illustrates a potentially common mechanism for the emergence of multi-resource coexistence despite single-resource competitive exclusions.",

Population history reconstruction based on genetic diversity data routinely relies on simple demographic models while projecting the past. No specific demographic assumptions are needed to understand the genetic structure of the founder population of Quebec. Because genealogy and genetics are intimately related, we used descending genealogies of this population to pursue the fate of its founder lineages. Maternal and paternal lines reflect the transmission of mtDNA and the Y-chromosome, respectively. We followed their transmission in real-time, from the 17th century down to its 20th-century population. We counted the number of married children of immigrants (i.e., their effective family size, EFS), estimated the proportion of successful immigrants in terms of their survival ratio, and assessed net growth rates and extinction. Likewise, we evaluated the same parameters for their Quebec-born descendants. The survival ratio of the first immigrants was the highest and declined over time in association with the decreasing immigrants EFS. Parents with high EFS left plentiful married progeny, putting EFS as the most important variable determining the parental demographic success throughout time for generations ahead. The 17th and 18th-century immigrants bear the most remarkable demographic and genetic impact on the 20th-century population of Quebec. Lessons learned from Quebec genealogies can teach us about the consequences of founder effects and migrations through real peoples history.

Our results show that CDSM supplemented with 2% glycerol supported a specific growth rate of E. coli cultures equivalent to that achieved using a nutritionally rich microbiological media (LB). The titre of recombinant protein produced following induction in a 4-hour expression screen was approximately equivalent in the CDSM fed cultures to that of baseline, and this was maintained in a 16-hr preparative fermentation. To understand the protein production achieved in CDSM fed culture we performed a quantitative analysis of proteome changes in the E. coli using mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed significant upregulation of protein synthesis machinery enzymes and significant downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes.

Furthermore, the choice of species is important, and there are anatomical, physiological, and cognitive reasons for favoring the rat over the mouse, which has been the standard for models of neurodegeneration and dementia. We report an initial assessment of the spatial learning, reversal, and sequencing task capabilities of knock-in Long-Evans rats with humanizing mutations in the A{beta}-coding region of App, which encodes amyloid precursor protein (Apph/h rats), using the IntelliCage, an automated operant social home cage system, at 6-8 weeks of age, then again at 4-5 months of age. These rats were previously generated as control organisms for studies on neurodegeneration involving other knock-in rat models from our lab. Apph/h rats of either sex can acquire place learning and reversal tasks. They can also acquire a diagonal sequencing task by 6-8 weeks of age, but not a more advanced serial reversal task involving alternating diagonals, even by 4-5 months of age.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder, leading to both physical and social morbidity. Worldwide 1% of the population is struggling with the disease, with 100,000 new cases annually only in the United States. Despite its importance, the goal of finding effective treatments for schizophrenia remains a challenging task, and previous work conducted expensive large-scale phenotypic screens. This work investigates the benefits of Machine Learning for graphs to optimize drug phenotypic screens and predict compounds that mitigate abnormal brain reduction induced by excessive glial phagocytic activity in schizophrenia subjects. Given a compound and its concentration as input, we propose a method that predicts a score associated with three possible compound effects, i.e., reduce, increase, or not influence phagocytosis. We leverage a high-throughput screening to prove experimentally that our method achieves good generalization capabilities. The screening involves 2218 compounds at five different concentrations. Then, we analyze the usability of our approach in a practical setting, i.e., prioritizing the selection of compounds in the SWEETLEAD library. We provide a list of 64 compounds from the library that have the most potential clinical utility for glial phagocytosis mitigation. Lastly, we propose a novel approach to computationally validate their utility as possible therapies for schizophrenia.\n\nAuthor summaryPhagocytosis is a fundamental biological process to protect biological organisms from exogenous infectious particles as well as to preserve equilibrium and efficiency of the host by removing its unwanted cells. A dysregulation of the phagocytic activity can lead to severe consequences for the host. In this study, we focus on a recent theory that relates an excessive phagocytic activity in brain cells, and a consequent abnormal reduction in brain volume, to the development of schizophrenia. Our working hypothesis is that pharmaceutical compounds that can reduce excessive of phagocytic activity might prove effective as a schizophrenia treatment. Rather than attempting to develop ex-novo such a chemical compound, we rely on a more cost-effective and efficient approach that seeks candidate therapies in a set of approved chemical compounds. To achieve this, we train a machine learning model capable of predicting, with good accuracy, the ability of a molecular compound to increase or decrease phagocytosis in the target brain cells. Our approach leverages learning models capable of directly processing the molecular graph of the compound, leading to the identification of 64 candidate drugs of potential clinical utility.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Speech is often degraded by environmental noise or hearing impairment. People can compensate for degradation, but this requires cognitive effort. Previous research has identified frontotemporal networks involved in effortful perception, but materials in these works were also less intelligible, and so it is not clear whether activity reflected effort or intelligibility differences. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to which spoken sentences were processed under distraction, and whether this depended on speech quality even when intelligibility of degraded speech was matched to that of clear speech (i.e., 100%). On each trial, participants either attended to a sentence, or to a concurrent multiple object tracking (MOT) task that imposed parametric cognitive load. Activity in bilateral anterior insula reflected task demands: during the MOT task, activity increased as cognitive load increased, and during speech listening, activity increased as speech became more degraded. In marked contrast, activity in bilateral anterior temporal cortex was speech-selective, and gated by attention when speech was degraded. In this region, performance of the MOT task with a trivial load blocked processing of degraded speech whereas processing of clear speech was unaffected. As load increased, responses to clear speech in these areas declined, consistent with reduced capacity to process it. This result dissociates cognitive control from speech processing: substantially less cognitive control is required to process clear speech than is required to understand even very mildly degraded, 100% intelligible, speech. Perceptual and control systems clearly interact dynamically during real-world speech comprehension.\n\nSignificance StatementSpeech is often perfectly intelligible even when degraded, e.g., by background sound, phone transmission, or hearing loss. How does degradation alter cognitive demands? Here, we use fMRI to demonstrate a novel and critical role for cognitive control in the processing of mildly degraded but perfectly intelligible speech. We compare speech that is matched for intelligibility but differs in putative control demands, dissociating cognitive control from speech processing. We also impose a parametric cognitive load during perception, dissociating processes that depend on tasks from those that depend on available capacity. Our findings distinguish between frontal and temporal contributions to speech perception and reveal a hidden cost to processing mildly degraded speech, underscoring the importance of cognitive control for everyday speech comprehension.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Although there is mounting evidence that input from the dorsal visual pathway is crucial for object processes in the ventral pathway, the specific functional contributions of dorsal cortex to these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that dorsal cortex computes the spatial relations among an objects parts - a processes crucial for forming global shape percepts - and transmits this information to the ventral pathway to support object categorization. Using fMRI with human participants (females and males), we discovered regions in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) that were selectively involved in computing object-centered part relations. These regions exhibited task-dependent functional and effective connectivity with ventral cortex, and were distinct from other dorsal regions, such as those representing allocentric relations, 3D shape, and tools. In a subsequent experiment, we found that the multivariate response of posterior IPS, defined on the basis of part-relations, could be used to decode object category at levels comparable to ventral object regions. Moreover, mediation and multivariate effective connectivity analyses further suggested that IPS may account for representations of part relations in the ventral pathway. Together, our results highlight specific contributions of the dorsal visual pathway to object recognition. We suggest that dorsal cortex is a crucial source of input to the ventral pathway and may support the ability to categorize objects on the basis of global shape.\n\nSignificance StatementHumans categorize novel objects rapidly and effortlessly. Such categorization is achieved by representing an objects global shape structure, that is, the relations among object parts. Yet, despite their importance, it is unclear how part relations are represented neurally. Here, we hypothesized that object-centered part relations may be computed by the dorsal visual pathway, which is typically implicated in visuospatial processing. Using fMRI, we identified regions selective for the part relations in dorsal cortex. We found that these regions can support object categorization, and even mediate representations of part relations in the ventral pathway, the region typically thought to support object categorization. Together, these findings shed light on the broader network of brain regions that support object categorization.",

The central amygdala (CeA) is known to mediate a panoply of consummatory and defensive behaviors, yet how specific activity patterns within CeA subpopulations guide optimal choices is incompletely understood. In a paradigm of appetitive conditioning in which mice freely forage for food across a continuum of cues, we find that two major subpopulations of CeA neurons, Somatostatin-positive (CeASst) and protein kinase C{delta}-positive (CeAPKC{delta}) neurons can assign motivational properties to environmental cues and encode memory of goal location. While the proportion of food responsive cells was higher within CeASst than CeAPKC{delta} neurons, only the activities of CeAPKC{delta}, but not CeASst, neurons were required for learning of contextual food cues. Since CeAPKC{delta} neurons are known to promote a range of defensive behaviors, our findings point to a model in which CeA circuit components are not organized in specialized functional units but can process both aversive and rewarding information in a context and experience dependent manner.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSTwo populations of central amygdala (CeA) neurons, CeAPKC{delta} and CeASst neurons can assign motivational properties to environmental cues and encode memory of goal location.\n\nThe proportion of food responsive cells was higher among CeASst, than CeAPKC{delta} neurons.\n\nThe activities of CeAPKC{delta}, but not CeASst, neurons are required for learning of contextual food cues.

    "preprint_abstract": "Many hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells function as place cells, increasing their firing rate when a specific place field is traversed. The dependence of CA1 place cell firing on position within the place field is asymmetric. We investigated the source of this asymmetry by injecting triangular depolarizing current ramps to approximate the spatially-tuned, temporally-diffuse depolarizing synaptic input received by these neurons while traversing a place field. Ramps were applied to CA1 pyramidal neurons from male rats in vitro (slice electrophysiology) and in silico (multi-compartmental NEURON model). Under control conditions, CA1 neurons fired more action potentials at higher frequencies on the up-ramp versus the down-ramp. This effect was more pronounced for dendritic compared to somatic ramps. We incorporated a four-state Markov scheme for NaV1.6 channels into our model and calibrated the spatial dependence of long-term inactivation according to the literature; this spatial dependence was sufficient to explain the difference in dendritic versus somatic ramps. Long-term inactivation reduced the firing frequency by decreasing open-state occupancy, and reduced spike amplitude during trains by decreasing occupancy in closed states, which comprise the available pool. PKC activator phorbol-dibutyrate, known to reduce NaV long-term inactivation, removed spike amplitude attenuation in vitro more visibly in dendrites and greatly reduced adaptation, consistent with our hypothesized mechanism. Intracellular application of a peptide inducing long-term NaV inactivation elicited spike amplitude attenuation during spike trains in the soma and greatly enhanced adaptation. Our synergistic experimental/computational approach shows that long-term inactivation of NaV1.6 is a key mechanism of adaptation in CA1 pyramidal cells.\n\nSignificance statementThe hippocampus plays an important role in certain types of memory, in part through context-specific firing of \"place cells\"; these cells were first identified in rodents as being particularly active when an animal is in a specific location in an environment, called the place field of that neuron. In this in vitro/in silico study, we found that long-term inactivation of sodium channels causes adaptation in the firing rate that could potentially skew the firing of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons earlier within a place field. A computational model of the sodium channel revealed differential regulation of spike frequency and amplitude by long-term inactivation, which may be a general mechanism for spike frequency adaptation in the central nervous system.",

Modules within the network provide insight into cellular and genomic structure and function, such as genes functioning in distinct cellular compartments and DNA replication. Examination of the phenotypic impact of network perturbation across 14 environmental conditions using deletion mutant data from the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that fitness in diverse environments is impacted by orthologous gene neighborhood and connectivity. By mapping the network onto the chromosomes of S. cerevisiae and the opportunistic human pathogen Candida albicans, which diverged [~]235 million years ago, we discovered that coevolving orthologous genes are not clustered in either species; rather, they are most often located on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome. The budding yeast coevolution network captures the hierarchy of eukaryotic cellular structure and function, provides a roadmap for genotype-to-phenotype discovery, and portrays the genome as an extensively linked ensemble of genes.",

Here we visualized the subcellular location of viral particles formed during replication of Pseudomonas nucleus-forming jumbo phages and discovered that they assemble a unique structure inside cells we term phage bouquets. We show that after capsids complete DNA packaging at the surface of the phage nucleus, tails assemble and attach to the capsids, and these particles accumulate to form bouquets at specific subcellular locations. In these bouquets, the viral particles are arranged in a spherical pattern with tails oriented inward and the heads outwards. Localized at fixed distances on either side of the phage nucleus, bouquets grow in size and number over time as new phage particles are added. In the presence of mutations that cause the phage nucleus to be mispositioned away from its typical position at the midcell, bouquets still localize at the same fixed distance from the nucleus, suggesting an active mechanism for their formation and positioning.

Individual structural abnormality maps for every glioma patient were calculated from the preoperative T1 images, and the individual abnormality index were further computed and explored the associations with clinical indicators. The results manifested that: 1. Every glioma patient show unique atrophy pattern; 2. Glioma patients also share consistent atrophy regions; 3.

Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which utilizes accessible prior knowledge about regulatory interactions to bridge the gaps between feature spaces. Systematic benchmarks demonstrated that GLUE is accurate, robust and scalable. We further employed GLUE for various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, model-based regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction (over millions of cells) and found that GLUE achieved superior performance for each task. As a generalizable framework, GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE for the community.",

    "preprint_abstract": "KaiC is a dual ATPase, with one active site in its N-terminal domain and another in its C-terminal domain, that drives the circadian clock system of cyanobacteria through sophisticated coordination of the two sites. To elucidate the coordination mechanism, we studied the contribution of the dual ATPase activities in the ring-shaped KaiC hexamer and these structural bases for activation and inactivation. At the N-terminal active site, a lytic water molecule is sequestered between the N-terminal domains, and its reactivity to ATP is controlled by the quaternary structure of the N-terminal ring. The C-terminal ATPase activity is regulated mostly by water-incorporating voids between the C-terminal domains, and the size of these voids is sensitive to phosphoryl modification of S431. The N-terminal ATPase activity inversely correlates with the affinity of KaiC for KaiB, a clock protein constitutes the circadian oscillator together with KaiC and KaiA, and the complete dissociation of KaiB from KaiC requires KaiA-assisted activation of the dual ATPase. Delicate interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal rings make it possible for the components of the dual ATPase to work together, thereby driving the assembly and disassembly cycle of KaiA and KaiB.\n\nSignificance StatementKaiC, a core clock protein in the cyanobacterial circadian clock system, hydrolyzes ATP at two distinct sites in a slow but ordered manner to measure the circadian time scale. We used biochemical and structural biology techniques to characterize the properties and interplay of dual ATPase active sites. Our results show that the N-terminal and C-terminal ATPases communicate with each other through an interface between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains in KaiC. The dual ATPase sites are regulated rhythmically in a concerted or opposing manner dependent on the phase of the circadian clock system, controlling the affinities of KaiC for other clock proteins, KaiA and KaiB.",

In the current work, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-LAMP assays were performed on extracted RNA of 7 wastewater samples from COVID-19 hotspots. RT{square}LAMP assay was also performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction. Current detection of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly by RT-qPCR of ORF (ORF1ab) and N genes so we targeted both to find the best surrogate marker for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We also performed RT-LAMP with/without RNA extraction inside microfluidic device to target both genes. Positivity rates of RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP performed on extracted RNA were 100.0% (7/7) and 85.7% (6/7), respectively. RT-qPCR results revealed that all 7 wastewater samples were positive for N gene (Ct range 37-39), and negative for ORF1ab, suggesting that N gene could be used as a surrogate marker for detection of SARS-CoV-2. RT-LAMP of N and ORF (ORF1a) genes performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction indicated that all 7 samples remains pink (negative). The color remains pink in all microchannels except microchannels which subjected to RT-LAMP for targeting N region after RNA extraction (yellow color) in 6 out of 7 samples.

    "preprint_abstract": "Near-threshold perception is a paradigm case of perceptual reports diverging from reality - perception of an unchanging stimulus can vacillate from undetected to clearly perceived. Among the many factors that predict whether a stimulus will reach awareness, the amplitude of low-frequency brain oscillations - particularly in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) - has emerged as a reliable predictor of trial-to-trial variability in perceptual decisions. Analysis grounded in signal detection theory suggest that strong prestimulus alpha oscillations diminish subjective perception without affecting the accuracy or sensitivity (d) of perceptual decisions. These results, coupled with recent studies on sensory responses, point to an inhibitory influence of alpha-band amplitude on early visuocortical activity. The findings to date have been based on simple, low-level visual stimuli, which warrant a focus on early visual processing. However, the physiology of alpha in higher-level visual areas is known to be distinct from early visual cortex, with evidence indicating that alpha amplitude in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex is excitatory (rather than inhibitory, as in early visual cortex). Here, we addressed the question of how spontaneous oscillatory amplitude impacts subjective and objective aspects of perception using a high-level perceptual decision task. Human observers completed a near-threshold face/house discrimination task with subjective visibility ratings while electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded. Using a single-trial multiple regression analysis, we found that spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus alpha-band amplitude were negatively related to visibility ratings but did not predict trial-by-trial accuracy. These results suggest that the inhibitory influence of prestimulus alpha activity in early visual cortex, rather than the excitatory influence of alpha in IT, comes to bias high-level perceptual reports. Our findings provide further evidence that ongoing alpha amplitude dissociates subjective and objective measures of visual perception.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe human primary sensory (S1) and primary motor (M1) hand areas feature high-frequency neuronal responses. Electrical nerve stimulation evokes high-frequency oscillations (HFO) at around 650 Hz in the contralateral S1. Likewise, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 can evoke a series of descending volleys in the corticospinal pathway that can be detected non-invasively with a paired-pulse TMS protocol, called short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF). SICF features several peaks of facilitation of motor evoked potentials in contralateral hand muscles, which are separated by inter-peak intervals resembling HFO rhythmicity.\n\nHypothesisIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that the individual expressions of HFO and SICF are tightly related to each other and to the regional myelin content in the sensorimotor cortex.\n\nMethodsIn 24 healthy volunteers, we recorded HFO and SICF, and, in a subgroup of 20 participants, we mapped the cortical myelin content using the ratio between the T1- and T2-weighted MRI signal as read-out.\n\nResultsThe individual frequencies and magnitudes of HFO and SICF curves were tightly correlated: the intervals between the first and second peak of cortical HFO and SICF showed a positive linear relationship (r= 0.703, p< 0.001), while their amplitudes were inversely related (r= -0.613, p= 0.001). The rhythmicity, but not the magnitude of the high-frequency responses, was related to the cortical myelin content: the higher the cortical myelin content, the shorter the inter-peak intervals of HFO and SICF.\n\nConclusionThe results confirm a tight functional relationship between high-frequency responses in S1 (i.e., HFO) and M1 (i.e., as measured with SICF). They also establish a link between the degree of regional cortical myelination and the expression of high-frequency responses in the human sensorimotor cortex, giving further the opportunity to infer their generators.",

This process occurs mainly in the spleen, where blood flows through submicrometric constrictions called inter-endothelial slits (IES), subjecting RBCs to large-amplitude deformations. In this work, we circulated RBCs through microfluidic devices containing microchannels that replicate the IES. The cyclic mechanical stresses experienced by the cells affected their biophysical properties and molecular composition, accelerating cell aging. Specifically, RBCs quickly transitioned to a more spherical, less deformable phenotype that hindered microchannel passage, causing hemolysis. This transition was associated with the release of membrane vesicles, which self-extinguished as the spacing between membrane-cytoskeleton linkers became tighter. Proteomics analysis of the mechanically aged RBCs revealed significant losses of essential proteins involved in antioxidant protection, gas transport, and cell metabolism. Finally, we show that these changes made mechanically aged RBCs more susceptible to macrophage phagocytosis. These results provide a comprehensive model to explain how physical stress induces RBC clearance in the spleen.",

Mutations in ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) cause two types of CMT, demyelinating CMT4A and axonal CMT2K. The GDAP1-linked CMT genotypes are mainly missense point mutations. Despite clinical profiling and in vivo studies on the mutations, the etiology of GDAP1-linked CMT is poorly understood. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural properties of the Finnish founding CMT2K mutation H123R as well as CMT2K-linked R120W, both of which are autosomal dominant mutations. The disease variant proteins retain close to normal structure and solution behaviour, but both present a large decrease in thermal stability. Using GDAP1 variant crystal structures, we identify a side chain interaction network between helices 3, 6, and 7, which is affected by CMT mutations, as well as a hinge in the long helix 6, which is linked to structural flexibility. Structural analysis of GDAP1 indicates that CMT may arise from disruption of specific intra- and intermolecular interaction networks, leading to alterations in GDAP1 structure and stability, and eventually, insufficient motor and sensory neuron function.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) transfer lipids between different organelles, and thus play key roles in lipid homeostasis and organelle dynamics. The lipid transfer often occurs at the membrane contact sites (MCS) where two membranes are held within 10-30 nm. While most LTPs act as a shuttle to transfer lipids, recent experiments reveal a new category of eukaryotic LTPs that may serve as a bridge to transport lipids in bulk at MCSs. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid transfer and MCS formation are not well understood. Here, we first review two recent studies of extended synaptotagmin (E-Syt)-mediated membrane binding and lipid transfer using novel approaches. Then we describe mathematical models to quantify the kinetics of lipid transfer by shuttle LTPs based on a lipid exchange mechanism. We find that simple lipid mixing among membranes of similar composition and/or lipid partitioning among membranes of distinct composition can explain lipid transfer against a concentration gradient widely observed for LTPs. We predict that selective transport of lipids, but not membrane proteins, by bridge LTPs leads to osmotic membrane tension by analogy to the osmotic pressure across a semipermeable membrane. A gradient of such tension and the conventional membrane tension may drive bulk lipid flow through bridge LTPs at a speed consistent with the fast membrane expansion observed in vivo. Finally, we discuss the implications of membrane tension and lipid transfer in organelle biogenesis. Overall, the quantitative models may help clarify the mechanisms of LTP-mediated MCS formation and lipid transfer.",

The first step involves tau binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, followed by macropinocytosis. Pathological tau assemblies are thought to exit the vesicular compartment as \"seeds\" for replication in the cytoplasm. Tau uptake is highly efficient, but only [~]1-10% of cells that take up aggregates exhibit seeding. To investigate the basis for this observation, we used fluorescently tagged full-length (FL) tau fibrils added to native U2OS cells, and \"biosensor\" cells expressing FL tau or repeat domain fused to mClover (Clo). FL tau-Clo bound tubulin, but seeds triggered its aggregation in multiple locations simultaneously in the cytoplasm, generally independent of visible exogenous aggregates. Most exogenous tau trafficked to the lysosome, but imaging revealed a small percentage that slowly and steadily accumulated in the cytosol. Intracellular expression of Gal3-mRuby, which binds intravesicular galactosides and forms puncta upon vesicle rupture, revealed no evidence of vesicle damage following tau exposure. In fact, most seeded cells had no evidence of lysosome rupture. However, live cell imaging indicated that cells with pre-existing Gal3-positive puncta exhibited seeding at a slightly higher rate than the general population, indicating a potential role for vesicle instability as a predisposing factor. Clearance of tau seeds occurred rapidly in both vesicular and cytosolic fractions. Bafilomycin inhibited vesicular clearance, whereas MG132 inhibited cytosolic clearance. Tau seeds that enter the cell thus have at least two fates: lysosomal clearance that degrades most tau, and entry into the cytosol, where seeds replicate, and are cleared by the proteasome.",

Despite known roles for the retromer in multiple trafficking events in yeast and mammalian cells, its role in development is poorly understood, and its potential function in primary ciliogenesis remains unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, we demonstrated that vps-26 homozygous knockout C. elegans have reduced brood sizes and impaired vulval development, as well as decreased body length which has been linked to defects in primary ciliogenesis. Since many endocytic proteins are implicated in the generation of primary cilia, we addressed whether the retromer regulates ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. We observed VPS35 localized to the primary cilium, and depletion of VPS26, VPS35 or SNX1/SNX5 led to decreased ciliogenesis. Retromer also coimmunoprecipitated with the capping protein, CP110, and was required for its removal from the mother centriole. Herein, we characterize new roles for the retromer in C. elegans development and in the regulation of ciliogenesis in mammalian cells, and suggest a novel role for the retromer in CP110 removal from the mother centriole.",

After replacing the ortho-methyl of crotamiton with ortho-fluoro, crotamiton derivative JM03 was obtained and showed better activity in terms of lifespan-extension and stress resistance than crotamiton. It was further explored that JM03 extended the lifespan of C. elegans through osmotic avoidance abnormal-9 (OSM-9). Besides, JM03 improves the ability of nematode to resist oxidative stress and hypertonic stress through OSM-9, but not osm-9/capsaicin receptor related-2 (OCR-2). Then the inhibition of OSM-9 by JM03 reduces the aggregation of Q35 in C. elegans via upregulating the genes associated with proteostasis. SKN-1 signaling was also found to be activated after JM03 treatment, which might contribute to proteostasis, stress resistance and lifespan extension. In summary, this study explored a new small molecule derived from crotamiton, which has efficient anti-oxidative, anti-hypertonic and anti-aging effects, and could further lead to promising application prospects.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, a hormone that increases insulin sensitivity, has shown promise as a therapeutic agent to improve metabolic dysregulation. Here we report that FGF21 directly targets cardiac myocytes by binding {beta}-klotho and FGF receptor (FGFR) 4. In combination with high glucose, FGF21 induces cardiac myocyte growth in width mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. While short-term FGF21 elevation can be cardio-protective, we find that in type 2 diabetes (T2D) in mice, where serum FGF21 levels are elevated, FGFR4 activation induces concentric cardiac hypertrophy. As T2D patients are at risk for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), we propose that induction of concentric hypertrophy by elevated FGF21-FGFR4 signaling constitutes a novel mechanism promoting T2D-associated HFpEF and that FGFR4 blockade might serve as a cardio-protective therapy in T2D. In addition, potential adverse cardiac effects of FGF21 mimetics currently in clinical trials should be investigated.",

To determine how infection impacts placental trophoblasts, we utilized rhesus macaque trophoblast stem cells (TSC) that can be differentiated into early gestation syncytiotrophoblasts (ST) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT). TSCs and STs, but not EVTs, were highly permissive to productive infection with ZIKV strain DAK AR 41524. The impact of ZIKV on the cellular transcriptome showed that infection of TSCs and STs increased expression of immune related genes, including those involved in type I and type III interferon responses. ZIKV exposure altered extracellular vesicle (EV) protein, mRNA, and miRNA cargo, regardless of productive infection. These findings suggest that early gestation macaque TSCs and STs are permissive to ZIKV infection, and that EV analysis may provide a foundation for identifying non-invasive biomarkers of placental infection in a highly translational model.",

Although they have proven to be very effective in the general population, little is known about their efficacy in immunocompromised patients. HIV-infected individuals response to vaccine may vary according to the type of vaccine and their level of immunosuppression. We evaluated immunogenicity of an mRNA anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccine in HIV-positive individuals.\n\nMethodsHIV-positive individuals (n=121) were recruited from HIV clinics in Montreal and stratified according to their CD4 counts. A control group of 20 health care workers naive to SARS CoV-2 was used. The participants Anti-RBD IgG responses were measured by ELISA at baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine).\n\nResultsEleven of 121 participants had anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline, and a further 4 had incomplete data for the analysis. Mean anti-RBD IgG responses were similar between between the HIV negative control group (n=20) and the combined HIV+ group (n=106) (p = 0.72). However, these responses were significantly lower in the group with <250 CD4 cells/mm3. (p<0.0001). Increasing age was independently associated with decreased immunogenicity.\n\nConclusionHIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts over 250 cells/mm3 have an anti-RBD IgG response similar to the general population. However, HIV-positive individuals with the lowest CD4 counts (<250 cells/mm3) have a weaker response. These data would support the hypothesis that a booster dose might be needed in this subgroup of HIV-positive individuals, depending on their response to the second dose.",

One common mechanism is adaptive introgression, which has received increasing attention as a potential route to rapid adaptation in populations struggling in the face of ecological change, particularly global climate change. However, hybridization can also result in deleterious genetic interactions that may limit the benefits of adaptive introgression. Here, we used a combination of genome-wide quantitative trait locus mapping and differential gene expression analyses between the swordtail fish species Xiphophorus malinche and X. birchmanni to study the consequences of hybridization on thermotolerance. While these two species are adapted to different thermal environments, we document a complicated architecture of thermotolerance in hybrids. We identify a region of the genome that contributes to reduced thermotolerance in individuals heterozygous for X. malinche and X. birchmanni ancestry, as well as widespread misexpression in hybrids of genes that respond to thermal stress in the parental species, particularly in the circadian clock pathway. We also show that a previously mapped hybrid incompatibility between X. malinche and X. birchmanni contributes to reduced thermotolerance in hybrids. Together, our results highlight the challenges of understanding the impact of hybridization on complex ecological traits and its potential impact on adaptive introgression.",

In the genomics era, this debate continues, with relatedness estimates being sensitive to the methods used to generate markers, marker quality, and levels of diversity in sampled individuals. Here, we compare six commonly used genome-based relatedness estimators (kinship genetic distance (KGD), Wang Maximum Likelihood (TrioML), Queller and Goodnight (Rxy), Kinship INference for Genome-wide association studies (KING-robust), and Pairwise Relatedness (RAB), allele-sharing co-ancestry (AS)) across five species bred in captivity-including three birds and two mammals-with varying degrees of reliable pedigree data, using reduced-representation and whole genome resequencing data. Genome-based relatedness estimates varied widely across estimators, sequencing methods, and species, yet the most consistent results for known first order relationships were found using Rxy, RAB, and AS. However, AS was found to be less consistently correlated with known pedigree relatedness than either Rxy or RAB. Our combined results indicate there is not a single genome-based estimator that is ideal across different species and data types. To determine the most appropriate genome-based relatedness estimator for each new dataset, we recommend assessing the relative: (1) correlation of candidate estimators with known relationships in the pedigree and (2) precision of candidate estimators with known first-order relationships. These recommendations are broadly applicable to conservation breeding programs, particularly where genome-based estimates of relatedness can complement and complete poorly pedigreed populations. Given a growing interest in the application of wild pedigrees, our results and are also applicable to in-situ wildlife management.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In early limb embryogenesis, synovial joints acquire specific shapes which determine joint motion and function. The process by which the opposing cartilaginous joint surfaces are moulded into reciprocal and interlocking shapes, called joint morphogenesis, is one of the least understood aspect of joint formation and the cell-level dynamics underlying it are yet to be unravelled. In this research, we quantified key cellular dynamics involved in growth and morphogenesis of the zebrafish jaw joint and synthesised them in a predictive computational simulation of joint development. Cells in larval zebrafish jaw joints labelled with cartilage markers were tracked over a forty-eight hour time window using confocal imaging. Changes in distance and angle between adjacent cell centroids resulting from cell rearrangement, volume expansion and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition were measured and used to calculate the rate and direction of local tissue deformations. We observed spatially and temporally heterogeneous growth patterns with marked anisotropy over the developmental period assessed. There was notably elevated growth at the level of the retroarticular process of the Meckels cartilage, a feature known to undergo pronounced shape changes during zebrafish development. Analysis of cell dynamics indicated a dominant role for cell volume expansion in growth, with minor influences from ECM volume increases and cell intercalation. Cell proliferation in the joint was minimal over the timeframe of interest. Synthesising the dynamic cell data into a finite element model of jaw joint development resulted in accurate shape predictions. Our biofidelic computational simulation demonstrated that zebrafish jaw joint growth can be reasonably approximated based on cell positional information over time, where cell positional information derives mainly from cell orientation and cell volume expansion. By modifying the input parameters of the simulation, we were able to assess the relative contributions of heterogeneous growth rates and of growth orientation. The use of uniform rather than heterogeneous growth rates only minorly impacted the shape predictions whereas isotropic growth fields resulted in altered shape predictions. The simulation results suggest that growth anisotropy is the dominant influence on joint growth and morphogenesis. This study addresses the gap of the cellular processes underlying joint morphogenesis, with implications for understanding the aetiology of developmental joint disorders such as developmental dysplasia of the hip and arthrogryposis.",

The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) is a known component of the VAN and DAN, but there is an important gap in the current knowledge regarding its involvement in the SN. In this study, we used a translational and multimodal approach to fulfill this gap and demonstrate the existence of a SN node within the vlPFC. First, we used tract-tracing methods in non-human primates (NHP) to quantify the anatomic connectivity strength between the different vlPFC areas and the frontal and insular cortices. The strongest connections with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) locations comprising the two main cortical SN nodes were derived from the caudal area 47/12. This location also has strong axonal projections to subcortical structures of the salience network, including the dorsomedial thalamus, hypothalamus, sublenticular extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Second, we used a seed-based functional connectivity analysis in NHP resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data to validate the caudal area 47/12 as an SN node. Third, we used the same approach in human rsfMRI data to identify a homologous structure in caudal area 47/12, also showing strong connections with the SN cortical nodes, thus confirming the caudal area 47/12 as the SN node in the vlPFC. Taken together, the vlPFC contains nodes for all three cognitive networks, the VAN, DAN, and SN. Thus, the vlPFC is in a position to switch between these three cognitive networks, pointing to a key role as an attentional hub. Its tight additional connections to the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, and ventral premotor cortices, places the vlPFC at the center for switching behaviors based on environmental stimuli, computing value and cognitive control.",

In this study we use information quantifiers to measure the complexity of electrocorticogram recordings in monkeys. We apply these metrics to compare different stages of general anesthesia for evaluating consciousness in several anesthesia protocols. We find that the complexity of brain activity can be used as a correlate of consciousness. For two of the anaesthetics used, propofol and medetomidine, we find that the anaesthetised state is accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of brain activity. On the other hand we observe that use of ketamine produces an increase in complexity measurements. We relate this observation with increase activity within certain brain regions associated with the ketamine used doses. Our measurements indicate that complexity of brain activity is a good indicator for a general evaluation of different levels of consciousness awareness, both in anesthetized and non anesthetizes states.",

These dual dopamine- and GABA-releasing cells are capable of marked experience-dependent changes in the expression of neurotransmitter-synthesising enzymes, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). However, such plasticity has most commonly been studied in cell populations identified by their expression of the enzyme being studied, and after long periods of sensory deprivation. Here, instead, we used brief 1- or 3-day manipulations of olfactory experience in juvenile mice, coupled with a conditional genetic approach that labelled neurons contingent upon their expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT-tdTomato). This enabled us to evaluate the potential for rapid changes in neurotransmitter-synthesising enzyme expression in an independently identified neuronal population. Our labelling strategy showed good specificity for olfactory bulb dopaminergic neurons, whilst revealing a minority sub-population of non-dopaminergic DAT-tdTomato cells that expressed the calcium-binding protein calretinin. Crucially, the proportions of these neuronal subtypes were not affected by brief alterations in sensory experience. Short-term olfactory manipulations also produced no significant changes in immunofluorescence or whole-bulb mRNA for the GABA-synthesising enzyme GAD67/Gad1. However, in bulbar DAT-tdTomato neurons brief sensory deprivation was accompanied by a transient, small drop in immunofluorescence for the dopamine-synthesising enzyme dopa decarboxylase (DDC), and a sustained decrease for TH. Deprivation also produced a sustained decrease in whole-bulb Th mRNA. Careful characterisation of an independently identified, genetically labelled neuronal population therefore enabled us to uncover rapid experience-dependent changes in dopamine-synthesising enzyme expression.",

To address the effect of warming waters on coregonine reproduction we experimentally evaluated different embryo incubation temperatures on post-hatching survival, growth, and critical thermal maximum of larval cisco (Coregonus artedi) sampled from lakes Superior and Ontario. Embryos were incubated at water temperatures of 2.0, 4.4, 6.9, and 8.9{degrees}C to simulate present and increased winter temperatures, and hatched larvae were reared in a common environment. For both populations, larval survival and critical thermal maximum were negatively related to incubation temperature, and larval growth was positively related to incubation temperature. The magnitude of change across incubation temperatures was greater in the population sampled from Lake Superior than Lake Ontario for all traits examined. The more rapid decrease in survival and critical thermal maximum across incubation temperatures for larval cisco in Lake Superior, compared to those from Lake Ontario, suggests that Lake Superior larvae may possess a more limited ability to acclimate to and cope with increasing winter water temperatures. However, the rapid increase in growth rates across incubation temperatures in Lake Superior larvae suggests they could recover better from hatching at a small length induced by warm winters, as compared to Lake Ontario larvae. Our results suggest propagation and restoration programs may want to consider integrating natural habitat preferences and maximizing phenotypic variability to ensure offspring are set up for success upon stocking.",

Submitted], a new model called Matryoshka model has been proposed to describe the geometry of atomic motions in phospholipid molecules in bilayers and multilamellar vesicles based on their quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) spectra. Here, in order to characterize the relaxational aspects of this model, the energy widths of the QENS spectra of the samples were analyzed first in a model-free way. The spectra were decomposed into three Lorentzian functions, which are classified as slow, intermediate, and fast motions depending on their widths. The analysis provides the diffusion coefficients, residence times, and geometrical parameters for the three classes of motions. The results corroborate the parameter values such as the amplitudes and the mobile fractions of atomic motions obtained by the application of the Matryoshka model to the same samples. Since the current analysis was carried out independently of the development of the Matryoshka model, the present results enhance the validity of the model. The model will serve as a powerful tool to decipher the dynamics of lipid molecules not only in model systems, but also in more complex systems such as mixtures of different kinds of lipids or natural cell membranes.",

Although hexaploids can be produced via human intervention, these neo- polyploids have quite unstable genomes and usually suffer from severe genome reshuffling. Whether these genome rearrangements continue in later generations and whether genomic arrangements follow similar, reproducible patterns between different lines is still unknown. We crossed Brassica hexaploids resulting from different species combinations to produce five F1 hybrids, and analyzed the karyotypes of the parents and the F1 hybrids, as well as allele segregation in a resulting test-cross population via molecular karyotyping using SNP array genotyping. Although some genomic regions were found to be more likely to be duplicated, deleted or rearranged, a consensus pattern was not shared between genotypes. Brassica hexaploids had a high tolerance for fixed structural rearrangements, but which rearrangements occur and become fixed over many generations does not seem to show either strong reproducibility or to indicate selection for stability. On average, we observed 10 de novo chromosome rearrangements contributed almost equally from both parents to the F1 hybrids. At the same time, the F1 hybrid meiosis produced on average 8.6 new rearrangements. Hence, the increased heterozygosity in the F1 hybrid did not significantly improve genome stability in our hexaploid hybrids, and might have had the opposite effect. However, hybridization between lineages was readily achieved and may be exploited for future genetics and breeding purposes.",

We report that increased V0-V1 engagement is associated with, and sufficient for, CASM activation. Upon V0-V1 binding, V-ATPase directly recruits ATG16L1, via K490, during LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), STING- and drug-induced CASM, indicating a common mechanism. Furthermore, during LAP, key molecular players, including NADPH oxidase/ROS, converge on V-ATPase. Finally, we show that LAP is sensitive to Salmonella SopF, which disrupts the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis, and provide evidence that CASM contributes to the Salmonella host response. Together, these data identify V-ATPase as a universal regulator of CASM, and indicate that SopF evolved in part to evade non-canonical autophagy.",

We seek to understand whether a mutations impact at the molecular and cellular levels scale with the severity of brain malformation. Here we focus on two mutations at the valine 409 residue of TUBA1A, V409I and V409A, identified in patients with pachygyria or lissencephaly, respectively. We find that ectopic expression of TUBA1A-V409I/A mutants disrupt neuronal migration in mice and promote excessive neurite branching and delayed retraction in primary neuronal cultures, accompanied by increased microtubule acetylation. To determine the molecular mechanisms, we modeled the V409I/A mutants in budding yeast and found that they promote intrinsically faster microtubule polymerization rates in cells and in reconstitution experiments with purified tubulin. In addition, V409I/A mutants decrease the recruitment of XMAP215/Stu2 to plus ends and ablate tubulin binding to TOG domains. In each assay tested, the TUBA1A-V409I mutant exhibits an intermediate phenotype between wild type and the more severe TUBA1A-V409A, reflecting the severity observed in brain malformations. Together, our data support a model in which the V409I/A mutations may limit tubulin conformational states and thereby disrupt microtubule regulation during neuronal morphogenesis and migration.",

Deletion of Kv3.3 (but not Kv3.1) increased presynaptic AP duration and facilitated transmitter release, which in turn enhanced short-term depression during high frequency transmission. The response to sound was delayed in the Kv3.3KO, with higher spontaneous and lower evoked firing, thereby reducing signal-to-noise ratio. Computational modelling showed that the enhanced EPSC and short-term depression in the Kv3.3KO reflected increased vesicle release probability and accelerated activity-dependent vesicle replenishment.

They show the unique ability to go beyond variant-level genetic association evidence and implicate critical functional units, e.g., genes, in disease etiology. However, in practice, when the two approaches are applied to the same molecular and complex trait data, the inference results can be markedly different. This paper systematically investigates the inferential reproducibility between the two approaches through theoretical derivation, numerical experiments, and analyses of 4 complex trait GWAS and GTEx eQTL data. We identify two classes of inconsistent inference results. We find that the first class of inconsistent results may suggest an interesting biological phenomenon, i.e., horizontal pleiotropy; thus, the two approaches are truly complementary. The inconsistency in the second class can be understood and effectively reconciled. To this end, we propose a novel approach for locus-level colocalization analysis. We demonstrate that the joint TWAS and locus-level colocalization analysis improves specificity and sensitivity for implicating biological-relevant genes.",

Such learning is often characterized by a \"moment of insight\", an abrupt and dramatic improvement in recognition. The mechanisms that support abrupt learning are unknown, but one hypothesis is that they involve changes in synchronization between brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we used a behavioral task in which non-human primates rapidly learned to recognize novel images and to associate them with specific responses. Simultaneous recordings from inferotemporal and prefrontal cortices revealed a transient synchronization of neural activity between these areas that peaked around the moment of insight. Synchronization was strongest between inferotemporal sites that encoded images and reward-sensitive prefrontal sites. Moreover, its magnitude intensified gradually over image exposures, suggesting that abrupt learning culminates from the search for informative signals within a circuit linking sensory information to task demands.",

Here we integrated multiple scRNA-seq studies and found that apCAFs are derived from mesothelial cells.

Efficient transgenesis and gene-editing in human intestinal stem cells (hISCs) would significantly improve utility of these models by enabling generation of reporter and loss/gain-of-function hISCs, but no published methods exist for transfecting 2D hISC monolayers. Electroporation has proven effective in other difficult-to-transfect cells; thus we applied this method to hISCs.\n\nMethodsTwenty-four electroporation parameters were tested, and the optimal condition for efficiency and viability was validated on hISCs from six anatomical regions along the small intestine and colon. PiggyBac transposase and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were used for stable genomic integration of reporter genes. High-throughput methods for clone isolation, expansion, and screening were developed. An hISC OLFM4-emGFP reporter was generated and validated by qPCR, organoid assays, and hISC compartmentalization on a planar crypt-microarray (PCM) device.\n\nResultsMaximum electroporation efficiency was 79.9% with a mean survival of 65%. Transfection of 105 hISCs produced [~]142 (0.14%) stable transposase-mediated clones. Transfection of OLFM4-targetting RNPs yielded [~]35% editing and 99/220 (45%) of antibiotic-resistant colonies analyzed expressed emGFP. OLFM4-emGFP hISCs applied to PCMs remained emGFP+ and proliferative in high-Wnt3a/R-spondin3/Noggin zones yet differentiated to emGFP-/KRT20+ cells outside engineered crypt zones. OLFM4-emGFP levels correlated with endogenous OLFM4. Olfm4-emGFPhigh cells were LGR5high/KRT20low, and demonstrated high organoid-forming potential.\n\nConclusionsElectroporation of hISCs is highly efficient for stable transgenesis and transgenic lines can be generated in 3-4 weeks. Workflows mirror conventional culture methods, facilitating rapid integration into established tissue-culture operations. OLFM4high is a robust hISC marker with functional properties in culture.",

Herein, we report remarkable increases of coagulation factors V (f5, [~]3145-fold) and tissue factor (f3a, [~]120-fold) in zebrafish ovarian follicle cells during ovulation. This increase was mediated through the nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr), which is essential for ovulation in zebrafish, and was totally abolished in ovarian follicular cells from pgr-/- mutants. In addition, promoter activities of f5 and f3a were significantly enhanced by progestin (DHP) via Pgr. Similar regulation of human F5 promoter activity was induced via human PGRB, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis of the zebrafish f5 promoter further demonstrated a direct regulation of coagulation factors via progestin response elements. Moreover, a stark increase of erythrocytes occurred in capillaries meshed in wildtype preovulatory follicles but was absent in pgr-/- mutants. Interestingly, anticoagulants significantly inhibited ovulation both in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Furthermore, reduced fecundity was observed in f5+/- female zebrafish. Taken together, our study provides plausible evidence for steroid regulation of coagulation factors, and a new hypothesis for blood clotting triggered ovulation in vertebrates.",

MSI2 appears to repress translation by binding to 3 untranslated regions (3UTRs) of mRNA, but the identity of functional targets remains unknown. Here we used iCLIP to identify direct RNA binding partners of MSI2 and integrated these data with polysome profiling to obtain insights into MSI2 function. iCLIP revealed specific MSI2 binding to thousands of target mRNAs largely in 3UTRs, but translational differences were restricted to a small fraction of these transcripts, indicating that MSI2 regulation is not triggered by simple binding. Instead, the functional targets identified here were bound at higher density and contain more \"U/TAG\" motifs compared to targets bound non-productively. To further distinguish direct and indirect targets, MSI2 was acutely depleted. Surprisingly, only 50 transcripts were found to undergo translational induction on acute MSI2 loss. Eukaryotic elongation factor 3A (EIF3A) was determined to be an immediate, direct target. We propose that MSI2 down-regulation of EIF3A amplifies these effects on the proteome. Our results also underscore the challenges in defining functional targets of RBP since mere binding does not imply a discernible functional interaction.",

Many organisms contend with such fluctuations by entering a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity, a phenomenon known as dormancy. This pool of dormant individuals (i.e., a seed bank) does not reproduce and is expected to act as an evolutionary buffer, though it is difficult to observe this effect directly over an extended evolutionary timescale. Through genetic manipulation, we analyze the molecular evolutionary dynamics of Bacillus subtilis populations in the presence and absence of a seed bank over 700 days. The ability of these bacteria to enter a dormant state increased the accumulation of genetic diversity over time and altered the trajectory of mutations, findings that were recapitulated using simulations based on a mathematical model of evolutionary dynamics. While the ability to form a seed bank did not alter the degree of negative selection, we found that it consistently altered the direction of molecular evolution across genes. Together, these results show that the ability to form a seed bank can affect the direction and rate of molecular evolution over an extended evolutionary timescale.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest protein families in the human genome. GPCRs transduct chemical signals from extracellular to intracellular regions via a conformational switch between active and inactive states upon ligand binding. While experimental structures of GPCRs remain limited, high-accuracy computational predictions are now possible with AlphaFold2. However, AlphaFold2 only predicts one state and is biased towards either the active or inactive conformation depending on the GPCR class. Here, a multi-state prediction protocol is introduced that extends AlphaFold2 to predict either active or inactive states at very high accuracy using state-annotated templated GPCR databases. The predicted models accurately capture the main structural changes upon activation of the GPCR at the atomic level. For most of the benchmarked GPCRs (10 out of 15), models in the active and inactive states were closer to their corresponding activation state structures. Median RMSDs of the transmembrane regions were 1.12 [A] and 1.41 [A] for the active and inactive state models, respectively. The models were more suitable for protein-ligand docking than the original AlphaFold2 models and template-based models. Finally, our prediction protocol predicted accurate GPCR structures and GPCR-peptide complex structures in GPCR Dock 2021, a blind GPCR-ligand complex modeling competition. We expect that high accuracy GPCR models in both activation states will promote understanding in GPCR activation mechanisms and drug discovery for GPCRs. At the time, the new protocol paves the way towards capturing the dynamics of proteins at high-accuracy via machine-learning methods.",

Even patients that survive CNS infections can have lasting neurological dysfunction resulting from immune and pathogen induced pathology. Developing approaches to noninvasively track pathology and immunity in the infected CNS is crucial for patient management and development of new therapeutics. Here, we develop novel MRI-based approaches to monitor virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in the living brain. We studied a relevant murine model in which a neurotropic virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) was introduced intranasally and then entered the brain via olfactory sensory neurons - a route exploited by many pathogens in humans. Using T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI, we identified small cerebral microbleeds as the earliest form of pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. Mechanistically, these microbleeds occurred in the absence of peripheral immune cells and were associated with infection of vascular endothelial cells. We monitored the adaptive response to this infection by developing methods to iron label and track individual virus specific CD8+ T cells by MRI. Transferred antiviral T cells were detected in the brain within a day of infection and were able to reduce cerebral microbleeds. These data demonstrate the utility of MRI in detecting the earliest pathological events in the virally infected CNS as well as the therapeutic potential of antiviral T cells in mitigating this pathology.",

We use a combination of sequence analysis, functional assays and selection experiments to examine an overlapped region in HIV-1 that encodes helical regions in both Env and Rev. We find that functional segregation occurs even in this overlap, with each protein spacing its functional residues in a manner that allows a mutable non-binding face of one helix to encode important functional residues on a charged face in the other helix.

FOP is caused by mutations in the type I BMP receptor gene ACVR1, which enable ACVR1 to utilize its natural antagonist, Activin A, as an agonistic ligand. The physiological relevance of this property is underscored by the fact that HO in FOP is exquisitely dependent on activation of FOP-mutant ACVR1 by Activin A, an effect countered by inhibition of Activin A via monoclonal antibody treatment. Hence, we surmised that ACVR1 antibodies that block activation of ACVR1 by ligand should also inhibit HO in FOP and provide an additional therapeutic option for this condition. Therefore, we generated ACVR1 monoclonal antibodies that block ACVR1s activation by its ligands. Surprisingly, in vivo, these ACVR1 antibodies stimulate HO and activate signaling of FOP-mutant ACVR1. This property is restricted to FOP-mutant ACVR1 and results from ACVR1 antibody-mediated dimerization of ACVR1. Conversely, wild type ACVR1 is inhibited by ACVR1 antibodies. These results uncover an additional novel property of FOP-mutant ACVR1 and indicate that ACVR1 antibodies should not be considered as therapeutics for FOP.",

Experiments with reciprocal bone marrow chimeras demonstrate that radio-resistant, non-hematopoietic cells play a dominant role in shaping age-dependent features of the neuroinflammatory response, as well as the clinical course, during EAE. Reminiscent of pMS, EAE in middle-aged adoptive transfer recipients is characterized by widespread microglial activation. Microglia from older mice express a distinctive transcriptomic profile, suggestive of enhanced chemokine synthesis and antigen presentation. Collectively, our findings suggest that drugs that suppress microglial activation, and acquisition or expression of aging-associated properties, may be beneficial in the treatment of progressive forms of inflammatory demyelinating disease.",

Here, we perform high-throughput allele-specific reporter assays to prioritize disease-associated variants for five autoimmune diseases. By examining variants that both promote allele-specific reporter expression and are located in accessible chromatin, we identify 60 putatively causal variants that enrich for statistically fine-mapped variants by up to 57.8-fold. We introduced the risk allele of a prioritized variant (rs72928038) into a human T cell line and deleted the orthologous sequence in mice, both resulting in reduced BACH2 expression. Naive CD8 T cells from mice containing the deletion had reduced expression of genes that suppress activation and maintain stemness. Our results represent an example of an effective approach for prioritizing variants and studying their physiologically relevant effects.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Predictive breeding is now widely practised in crop improvement programs and has accelerated selection response (i.e., the amount of genetic gain between breeding cycles) for complex traits. However, world food production needs to increase further to meet the demands of the growing human population. The prediction of complex traits with current methods can be inconsistent across different genetic, environmental, and agronomic management contexts because the complex relationships between genomic and phenotypic variation are not well accounted for. Therefore, developing gene-to-phenotype network models for traits that integrate the knowledge of networks from systems biology, plant and crop physiology with population genomics has been proposed to close this gap in predictive modelling. Here, we develop a gene-to-phenotype network for shoot branching, a critical developmental pathway underpinning harvestable yield for many crop species, as a case study to explore the value of developing gene-to-phenotype networks to enhance understanding of selection responses. We observed that genetic canalization is an emergent property of the complex interactions among shoot branching gene-to-phenotype network components, leading to the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation, reduced selection responses, and large variation in selection trajectories across populations. As genetic canalization is expected to be pervasive in traits, such as grain yield, that result from interactions among multiple genes, traits, environments, and agronomic management practices, the need to model traits in crop improvement programs as outcomes of gene-to-phenotype networks is highlighted as an emerging opportunity to advance our understanding of selection response and the efficiency of developing resilient crops for future climates.",

Soil inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis revealed fewer arbuscules and other fungal structures in the endodermal cells of roots in tangmic relative to WT. The roots of tangmic hyperaccumulated acyclic cis-carotenes, while only trace levels of xanthophylls and abscisic acid were detected. In response to a water deficit, leaves from the tangmic plants displayed a rapid decline in maximum quantum yield of photosystem II compared to WT, indicating a defective root to shoot signalling response to drought. The lack of xanthophylls biosynthesis in tangmic roots reduced abscisic acid levels, thereby likely impairing endomycorrhiza colonisation and drought-induced root to shoot signalling.\n\nResearch HighlightsO_LIPhotoisomerization of prolycopene to lycopene is limited in root plastids.\nC_LIO_LIRoots of tangerine reveal an important tissue sink to store micronutrients such as prolycopene.\nC_LIO_LIRoots of tangerine lack ABA and show impaired mycorrhizal colonization.\nC_LIO_LIThe tangerine plant is drought sensitive and has a smaller biomass as well as reduced yield.\nC_LI",

One such evolution occurs in Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants at three amino acid positions K417, E484, and N501 in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. We examined the physical mechanisms underlying the convergent evolution of three mutations K417T/E484K/N501Y by delineating the individual and collective effects of mutations on binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, protein stability and expression. Our results show that each mutation serves a distinct function that improves virus fitness supporting its positive selection, even though individual mutations have deleterious effects that make them prone to negative selection. Compared to the wild-type, K417T escapes Class 1 antibodies, has increased stability and expression; however, it has decreased receptor binding. E484K escapes Class 2 antibodies; however, it has decreased receptor binding, stability and expression. N501Y increases receptor binding; however, has decreased stability and expression. When these mutations come together, the deleterious effects are mitigated due to the presence of compensatory effects. Triple mutant K417T/E484K/N501Y has increased receptor binding, escapes both Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies, and has similar stability and expression as that of the wild-type. These results show the implications of presence of multiple mutations on virus evolution that enhance viral fitness on different fronts by balancing both positive and negative selection and improves the chances of selection of mutations together.",

Specifically, we train a GNN to distinguish between functional networks associated with interictal and ictal phases. The GNN is equipped with an attention-based layer that automatically learns to identify those regions of the brain (associated with individual electrodes) that are most important for a correct classification. The localisation of these regions does not require any prior information regarding the seizure onset zone.\n\nWe show that the regions of interest identified by the GNN strongly correlate with the localisation of the seizure onset zone reported by electroencephalographers. We report results both for human patients and for simulators of brain activity. We also show that our GNN exhibits uncertainty on those patients for which the clinical localisation was unsuccessful, highlighting the robustness of the proposed approach.",

HCC immunotherapy offers great promise; however, recent data suggests NASH-HCC may be less sensitive to conventional immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). We hypothesised that targeting neutrophils using a CXCR2 small molecule inhibitor may sensitise NASH-HCC to ICI therapy.\n\nDesignNeutrophil infiltration was characterised in human HCC and mouse models of HCC. Late-stage intervention with anti-PD1 and/or a CXCR2 inhibitor was performed in murine models of NASH-HCC. The tumour immune microenvironment was characterised by imaging mass cytometry, RNA-seq and flow cytometry.\n\nResultsNeutrophils expressing CXCR2, a receptor crucial to neutrophil recruitment in acute-injury, are highly represented in human NASH-HCC. In models of NASH-HCC lacking response to ICI, the combination of a CXCR2 antagonist with anti-PD1 suppressed tumour burden and extended survival. Combination therapy increased intratumoral XCR1+ dendritic cell activation and CD8+ T cell numbers which are associated with anti-tumoral immunity, this was confirmed by loss of therapeutic effect upon genetic impairment of myeloid cell recruitment, neutralisation of the XCR1-ligand XCL1 or depletion of CD8+ T cells. Therapeutic benefit was accompanied by an unexpected increase in tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs) which switched from a pro-tumor to anti-tumour progenitor-like neutrophil phenotype. Reprogrammed TANs were found in direct contact with CD8+ T cells in clusters that were enriched for the cytotoxic anti-tumoural protease granzyme B. Neutrophil reprogramming was not observed in the circulation indicative of the combination therapy selectively influencing TANs.\n\nConclusionCXCR2-inhibition induces reprogramming of the tumour immune microenvironment that promotes ICI in NASH-HCC.\n\nSignificance of this studyWhat is already known on this subject? O_LIImmune checkpoint inhibition therapy is emerging as a promising new therapy for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nC_LIO_LIOnly a minority of HCC patients will respond to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy and recent data suggest that HCC on the background of NASH may have reduced sensitivity to this treatment strategy.\nC_LIO_LINeutrophils are a typical myeloid component of the liver in NASH and are found either within the HCC tumour microenvironment or in a peritumoural location.\nC_LIO_LINeutrophils have considerable phenotypic plasticity and can exist in both tumour promoting and tumour suppressing states.\nC_LIO_LINeutrophils may have the ability to influence ICI therapy.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings? O_LICXCR2+ neutrophils are found in human NASH and within the tumour of both human and mouse models of NASH-HCC.\nC_LIO_LIThe resistance of NASH-HCC to anti-PD1 therapy is overcome by co-treatment with a CXCR2 small molecule inhibitor, with evidence of reduced tumour burden and extended survival.\nC_LIO_LIAnti-PD1 and CXCR2 inhibitor combine to selectively reprogramme tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs) from a pro- to an anti-tumour phenotype.\nC_LIO_LIReprogrammed TANs proliferate locally within Granzyme B+ immune clusters that contain physically associating CD8+ T cells and antigen presenting cells.\nC_LIO_LIConventional XCR1+ dendritic cells (cDC1s) are found to be elevated in anti-PD1 and CXCR2 inhibitor treated HCCs and together with CD8+ T cells are required for therapeutic benefit.\nC_LI How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?\n\nO_LITANs can be selectively manipulated to adopt an anti-tumour phenotype which unlocks their potential for cancer therapy.

Traditional and molecular karyotyping are considered the first-tier diagnostic tests to detect macroscopic and cryptic deletions/duplications. However, their time-consuming and laborious experimental protocols protract diagnostic times from three to fifteen days. Long read sequencing approaches, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), have the ability to reduce time to results for the detection of uSVs with the same resolution of current state-of-the-art diagnostic tests.\n\nHere we compared ONT to molecular karyotyping for the detection of pathogenic uSVs of 7 patients with previously diagnosed causative CNVs of different sizes and allelic fractions. Larger chromosomal anomalies included trisomy 21 and mosaic tetrasomy 12p. Among smaller CNVs we tested two reciprocal genomic imbalances in 7q11.23 (1.367 Mb), a 170 kb deletion encompassing NRXN1 and mosaic 6q27 (1.231 Mb) and 2q23.1 (408 kb) deletions. DNA libraries were prepared following ONT standard protocols and sequenced on the GridION device for 48 h. Data generated during runs were analysed in online mode, using NanoGLADIATOR.\n\nWe were capable to identify all pathogenic CNVs with detection time inversely proportional to size and allelic fraction. Aneuploidies were called after only 30 minutes of sequencing, while 30 hours were needed to call CNVs < 500 kb also in mosaic state (44%). These results demonstrate the clinical utility of our approach that allows the molecular diagnosis of genomic disorders within a 30 minutes to 30 hours time-frame.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Animals integrate changes in external and internal environments to generate behavior. While neural circuits detecting external cues have been mapped, less is known about how internal states like hunger are integrated into behavioral outputs. We use the nematode C. elegans to decode how changes in internal nutritional status affects chemosensory behaviors. We show that acute food deprivation leads to a reversible decline in repellent, but not attractant, sensitivity. This behavioral change requires two conserved transcription factors MML-1 (Mondo A) and HLH-30 (TFEB), both of which translocate from the intestinal nuclei to the cytoplasm upon food deprivation. Next, we identify insulin-like peptides INS-23 and INS-31 as candidate ligands relaying food-status signals from the intestine to other tissues. Furthermore, we show that ASI chemosensory neurons use the DAF-2 insulin receptor, PI-3 Kinase, and the mTOR complex to integrate these intestine-released peptides. Together, our study shows how internal food status signals are integrated by transcription factors and intestine-neuron signaling to generate flexible behaviors.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe have all experienced behavioral changes when we are hungry - the pang in our stomach can cause us to behave erratically. In particular, hungry animals, including humans, are known to pursue behaviors that involve higher risk compared to when they are well-fed. Here we explore the molecular details of this behavior in the invertebrate animal model C. elegans. This behavior, termed sensory integration, shows that C. elegans display reduced copper sensitivity when hungry. Copper is toxic and repellant to C. elegans; reduced avoidance indicates that these animals use riskier food search behaviors when they are hungry. Luckily, like us, this behavioral change is reversible upon re-feeding. This hunger-induced behavioral change is not due to increased attraction to food or depletion of fat stores, but rather insulin signaling between the intestine and specific neurons. We use genetic tools, microscopy, and behavioral tests to determine that this risky behavior involves sensation of \"lack of food\" in the intestine, release of signaling molecules, and engagement with sensory neurons. Our work highlights new and potentially evolutionarily conserved ways in which intestinal cells and neurons communicate leading to largescale behavioral change, providing further support for the importance of the gut-brain-axis.",

Thus, tests with adequate levels of sensitivity are especially important for discriminating between infected and non-infected areas.\n\nAimWe reassessed the prevalence of E. multilocularis at the southern border of its distribution in Alto Adige (Italy), to improve surveillance in wildlife and provide more accurate estimates of exposure risk.\n\nMethodsWe compared results from the diagnostic test currently implemented for surveillance (based on Coproscopy+Multiplex PCR - CMPCR), against a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for 235 fox faeces collected in 2019-2020. The performances of the two tests were estimated using a scraping technique (SFCT) as the gold standard applied to the small intestines of a subsample (n=123) of the same hosts. True prevalence was calculated and sample size required by each faecal test for the detection of the parasite was then estimated.\n\nResultsTrue prevalence of E. multilocularis in foxes (14.3%) was definitely higher than reported in the last decade (never >5% from 2012 to 2018). The qPCR also had a higher sensitivity (83%) compared to CMPCR (21%). Agreement with the gold standard was far higher for qPCR (0.816) than CMPCR (0.298) as well, determining a smaller sample size required to detect the disease.\n\nConclusionsAlto Adige should be considered a highly endemic area. Surveillance at the edges of E. multilocularis distribution should adopt qPCR diagnostics on definitive hosts on a small geographic scale.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEchinococcus multilocularis is an intestinal flatworm, whose adult stage in Europe is harboured mainly by the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which spreads parasites eggs by faeces. This parasite is the agent of a severe and potentially lethal zoonosis, the alveolar echinococcosis, affecting humans after accidental ingestion of parasites eggs. In the Italian Alpine area, which represents the southernmost border of E. multilocularis European range, surveillance is hindered by a fragmented distributional pattern, where presence in foxes has been consistently reported only in few isolated foci in Alto Adige (Bolzano province - Italy) of low prevalence. In order to improve the efficiency of monitoring efforts, we tested the performances of two diagnostic protocols on fox faeces (sedimentation, filtration, counting technique followed by standard PCR, and whole stool real-time PCR) against a benchmark technique on fox intestines (scraping, filtration, counting technique - considered as the gold standard). This allowed not only to determine qPCR as a far more sensitive and sample-efficient diagnostic tool for E. multilocularis detection in marginally affected areas, but also to re-assess its prevalence in Alto Adige, which should be considered a highly endemic area. Consequent actions in the field and modifications in the surveillance strategy should be therefore considered.",

Current study applied gel-free proteomic techniques to unravel soybean response mechanism to flooding stress. Two-days-old soybeans were flooded for 4 days continuously and root samples were collected at days 2 to 6 for proteomic and enzymatic analyses. Age-matched untreated soybeans were collected as control. After protein extraction, purification and tryptic digestion, the peptides were analyzed on nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 539 and 472 proteins with matched peptides 2 or more were identified in control and flooded seedlings, respectively. Among these 364 proteins were commonly identified in both control and flooded soybeans. Fourty-two proteins abundances were changed 4-fold after 2-days of flooding stress as compared to starting point. The cluster analysis showed that highly increased proteins included cupin family proteins, enolase, pectin methylesterase inhibitor, glyoxalase II, alcohol dehydrogenase and aldolase. The enzyme assay of enolase and pectin methylesterase inhibitor confirmed protein abundance changes. These findings suggest that soybean adopts the less energy consuming strategies and brings biochemical and structural changes in the cell wall to effectively respond to flooding stress and for the survival.",

However, the mechanisms that control the subsynaptic dynamics of these receptors and their contribution to synaptic signaling are poorly understood. Here, using complementary super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule tracking techniques, we provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the nanoscale distribution and mobility of presynaptic mGluRs in hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate that the group II receptor mGluR2 localizes diffusely along the axon and boutons, and is highly mobile, while the group III receptor mGluR7 is stably anchored at the active zone, indicating that distinct mechanisms underlie the dynamic distribution of these receptor types. Surprisingly, using domain swapping experiments we found that intracellular interactions modulate surface diffusion of mGluR2, but not mGluR7. Instead, we found that immobilization of mGluR7 at the active zone relies on its extracellular domain. Importantly, receptor activation or increase in synaptic activity did not alter the surface mobility of presynaptic mGluRs. Finally, computational modeling of presynaptic mGluR activity revealed that the precise subsynaptic distribution of mGluRs controls their activation probability and thus directly impacts their ability to modulate neurotransmitter release. Altogether, this study demonstrates that distinct mechanisms control surface mobility of presynaptic mGluRs to differentially contribute to the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission.",

An important downstream response of EPO signaling is calcium influx, which is regulated by transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) proteins, particularly TRPC2 and TRPC6. While EPO induces Ca2+influx through TRPC2, TRPC6 inhibits the function of TRPC2. Thus, interactions between TRPC2 and TRPC6 regulate the rate of Ca2+influx in EPO-induced erythropoiesis. In this study, we observed that the expression of TRPC6 in c-KIT positive erythroid progenitor cells is regulated by DOT1L. DOT1L is a methyltransferase that plays an important role in many biological processes during embryonic development, including early erythropoiesis. We previously reported that Dot1L knockout (Dot1L-KO) hematopoietic progenitors in the yolk sac failed to develop properly, which resulted in lethal anemia. In this study, we have detected a marked downregulation of Trpc6 gene expression in Dot1L-KO progenitor cells in the yolk sac compared to wildtype. However, the expression of Trpc2, the positive regulator of Ca2+influx, remained unchanged. The promoter and the proximal region of the Trpc6 gene loci exhibited an enrichment of H3K79 methylation, which is mediated solely by DOT1L. As the loss of DOT1L affects the expression of TRPC6, which inhibits Ca2+influx by TRPC2, Dot1L-KO progenitor cells in the yolk sac exhibit accelerated and sustained high levels of Ca2+influx. Such heightened Ca2+ levels might have detrimental effects on the development of hematopoietic progenitor cells in response to erythropoietin.",

This mechanism patterns diverse chromatin landscapes and stabilizes constitutive heterochromatin of neocortical neurons. We show NDE1 undergoes dynamic liquid-liquid phase separation, partitioning to the nucleus and interacting with pericentromeric and centromeric satellite repeats. Nde1 LOF results in nuclear architecture aberrations and DNA double strand breaks, as well as instability and derepression of pericentromeric satellite repeats in neocortical neurons.

In recent decades, protein-level fitness landscapes have revealed extensive idiosyncratic epistasis among specific mutations. In contrast, other work has found ubiquitous and apparently non-specific patterns of global diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis among mutations across the genome. Here, we use a hierarchical CRISPR gene drive system to construct all combinations of 10 missense mutations from across the genome in budding yeast, and measure their fitness in six environments. We show that the resulting fitness landscapes exhibit global fitness-correlated trends, but that these trends emerge from specific idiosyncratic interactions.

    "preprint_abstract": "The Toxoplasma gondii lytic cycle is a repetition of host cell invasion, replication, egress, and re-invasion into the next host cell. While the molecular players involved in egress have been studied in greater detail in recent years, the signals and pathways for triggering egress from the host cell have not been fully elucidated. A perforin-like protein, PLP1, has been shown to be necessary for permeabilizing the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane or exit from the host cell. In vitro studies indicated that PLP1 is most active in acidic conditions, and indirect evidence using superecliptic pHluorin indicated that the PV pH drops prior to parasite egress. Using ratiometric pHluorin, a GFP variant that responds to changes in pH with changes in its bimodal excitation spectrum peaks, allowed us to directly measure the pH in the PV prior to and during egress by live-imaging microscopy. A statistically significant change was observed in PV pH during egress in both wild-type RH and {Delta}plp1 vacuoles compared to DMSO-treated vacuoles. Interestingly, if parasites are chemically paralyzed, a pH drop is still observed in RH but not in {Delta}plp1 tachyzoites. This indicates that the pH drop is dependent on the presence of PLP1 or motility. Efforts to determine transporters, exchangers, or pumps that could contribute to the drop in PV pH identified two formate-nitrite transporters (FNTs). Auxin-induced conditional knockdown and knockouts of FNT1 and FNT2 reduced the levels of lactate and pyruvate released by the parasites and lead an abatement of vacuolar acidification. While additional transporters and molecules are undoubtedly involved, we provide evidence of a definitive reduction in vacuolar pH associated with induced and natural egress and characterize two transporters that contribute to the acidification.\n\nAuthor SummaryToxoplasma gondii is a single celled intracellular parasite that infects many different animals, and it is thought to infect up to one third of the human population. This parasite must rupture out of its replicative compartment and the host cell to spread from one cell to another. Previous studies indicated that a decrease in pH occurs within the replicative compartment near the time of parasite exit from host cells, an event termed egress. However, it remained unknown whether the decrease in pH is directly tied to egress and, if so, what is responsible for the decrease in pH. Here we used a fluorescent reporter protein to directly measure pH within the replicative compartment during parasite egress. We found that pH decreases immediately prior to parasite egress and that this decrease is linked to parasite disruption of membranes. We also identified a family of transporters that release acidic products from parasite use of glucose for energy as contributing to the decrease in pH during egress. Our findings provide new insight that connects parasite glucose metabolism to acidification of its replicative compartment during egress from infected cells.",

The pattern of staining for FMDV proteins was consistent with the virus binding to follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). We have now demonstrated a similar pattern of FMDV protein staining in mouse spleens after acute infection and showed FMDV proteins are colocalised with FDCs. Blocking antigen binding to complement receptor type 2 and 1 (CR2/CR1) prior to infection with FMDV significantly reduced the detection of viral proteins on FDCs and FMDV genomic RNA in spleen samples. Blocking the receptors prior to infection also significantly reduced neutralising antibody titres. Therefore, the binding of FMDV to FDCs and sustained induction of neutralising antibody responses are dependent on FMDV binding to CR2/CR1 in mice.\n\nAuthor SummaryFoot and mouth disease virus causes a highly contagious acute vesicular disease, resulting in more than 50% of cattle, regardless of vaccination status, and almost 100% of African buffalo becoming persistently infected for long periods (months) of time. Yet, the mechanisms associated with establishment of persistent infections are still poorly understood. Infected animals are characterised by the presence of long-lived neutralising antibody titres, which contrast with the short-lived response induced by vaccination. We have used a mouse model to understand how foot and mouth disease virus is trapped and retained in the spleen for up to 28 days post infection and how the absence of antigen in the germinal centre prevents a sustainable neutralising antibody response, in the mouse. Our results highlight the importance of targeting antigen to FDCs to stimulate potent neutralising antibody responses after vaccination.",

However, the extraction and integration of word meaning from the parafoveal word and its possible influence on the semantic sentence context are controversial. In the current study, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in the RSVP-with-flankers paradigm to test whether and how updates of sentential meaning that are based only on parafoveal information influence the subsequent foveal processing. Using Chinese sentences, the sentence congruency of parafoveal and foveal target words were orthogonally manipulated. In contrast to previous research, we also controlled for potentially confounding effects of parafoveal-to-foveal repetition priming (identity preview effects) on the N400. Crucially, we found that the classic effect of foveal congruency on the N400 component only appeared when the word in preview had been congruent with sentence meaning; in contrast, there was no N400 when the preview word had been incongruent. These results indicate that sentence meaning rapidly adapts to parafoveal preview, which already changes the context for the then fixated word. We also show that a correct parafoveal preview generally attenuates the N400 once a word is fixated, regardless of congruency. Taken together, our findings underline the highly generative and adaptive framework of language comprehension.",

    "preprint_abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that sex chromosomes are not only the \"battlegrounds\" between sexes, but also the \"Great Walls\" fencing-off introgression between diverging lineages. Here we describe conflicting roles of nascent sex chromosomes on patterns of introgression in an experimental hybrid swarm. Drosophila nasuta and D. albomicans are recently diverged, fully fertile sister species that have different sex chromosome systems. The fusion between an autosome (Muller CD) with the ancestral X and Y gave rise to neo-sex chromosomes in D. albomicans, while Muller CDs remains unfused in D. nasuta. We found that a large block containing overlapping inversions on the neo-sex chromosome stood out as the strongest barrier to introgression. Intriguingly, the neo-sex chromosome introgression barrier is asymmetrical in a sex-dependent manner. Female hybrids showed significant D. albomicans biased introgression on Muller CD (neo-X excess), while males showed heterosis with excessive (neo-X, D. nasuta Muller CD) genotypes. While the neo-Y is a more compatible pairing partner of the neo-X, it also shows moderate levels of degeneration and may thus be selectively disfavored, and sex ratio assay revealed heterospecific meiotic drive. We used a population genetic model to dissect the interplay of sex chromosome drive, heterospecific pairing incompatibility between the neo-sex chromosomes and unfused Muller CD, neo-Y disadvantage, and neo-X advantage in generating the observed neo-X excess in females and heterozygous (neo-X, D. nasuta Muller CD) genotypes in males. We show that moderate neo-Y disadvantage and D. albomicans specific meiotic drive are required to counteract the effect of heterospecific meiotic drive observed in our cross, in concert with pairing incompatibility and neo-X advantage to explain observed genotype frequencies. Together, this hybrid swarm between a young species pair shed light onto the dual roles of neo-sex chromosome evolution in creating a sex-dependent asymmetrical introgression barrier at species boundary.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The most commonly occurring intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are polyampholytes, which are defined by the duality of low net charge per residue and high fractions of charged residues. Recent experiments have uncovered nuances regarding sequence-ensemble relationships of model polyampholytic IDPs. These include differences in conformational preferences for sequences with lysine vs. arginine, and the suggestion that well-mixed sequences form a range of conformations, including globules, conformations with ensemble averages that are reminiscent of ideal chains, or self-avoiding walks. Here, we explain these observations by analyzing results from atomistic simulations. We find that polyampholytic IDPs generally sample two distinct stable states, namely globules and self-avoiding walks. Globules are favored by electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged residues, whereas self-avoiding walks are favored by favorable free energies of hydration of charged residues. We find sequence-specific temperatures of bistability at which globules and self-avoiding walks can coexist. At these temperatures, ensemble averages over coexisting states give rise to statistics that resemble ideal chains without there being an actual counterbalancing of intra-chain and chain-solvent interactions. At equivalent temperatures, arginine-rich sequences tilt the preference toward globular conformations whereas lysine-rich sequences tilt the preference toward self-avoiding walks. We also identify differences between aspartate and glutamate containing sequences, whereby the shorter aspartate sidechain engenders preferences for metastable, necklace-like conformations. Finally, although segregation of oppositely charged residues within the linear sequence maintains the overall two-state behavior, compact states are highly favored by such systems.\n\nSignificance StatementIntrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins, when tethered to folded domains, function either as flexible tails or as linkers between domains. Most IDRs are polyampholytes that comprise a mixture of oppositely charged residues. Recent measurements of tethered polyampholytes showed that tendency of arginine- and lysine-rich sequences to behave very differently from one another. Using computer simulations, we show that these differences are determined by differences in free energies of hydration, steric volumes, and other considerations. Further, the interplay between electrostatic attractions and favorable free energies of hydration creates distinct stable states for polyampholytic IDRs. These findings have implications for switch-like transitions and the regulation of effective concentrations of interaction motifs by IDRs.",

In humans, there is a sex difference in body fat distribution, and steroid hormones are known to regulate several cellular processes within adipose tissue. Our aim was to investigate if intra-adipose steroid concentration and expression or activity of steroidogenic enzymes were associated with features of adipose tissue dysfunction in individuals with severe obesity.\n\nMethodsSamples from 40 bariatric candidates (31 women, 9 men) were included in the study. Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were collected during surgery. Adipose tissue morphology was measured by a combination of histological staining and semi-automated quantification. Following extraction, intra-adipose and plasma steroid concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Aromatase activity was estimated using product-over-substrate ratio, while AKR1C2 activity was measured directly by fluorogenic probe. Gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR.\n\nResultsVAT aromatase activity was positively associated with VAT adipocyte hypertrophy (p-valueadj < 0.01) and negatively with plasma HDL-cholesterol (p-valueadj < 0.01), while SAT aromatase activity predicted dyslipidemia in women even after adjustment for waist circumference, age and hormonal contraceptive use. We additionally compared women with high and low visceral adiposity index (VAI) and found that VAT excess is characterized by adipose tissue dysfunction, increased androgen catabolism mirrored by increased AKR1C2 activity and higher aromatase expression and activity indices.\n\nConclusionIn women, increased androgen catabolism or aromatization is associated with visceral adiposity and adipose tissue dysfunction.\n\nDISCLOSURE SUMMARYAT obtained consulting fees form Bausch Health, Novo Nordisk and research funding from Johnson & Johnson Medical Companies as well as Medtronic and GI Windows for studies unrelated to this manuscript.

Optogenetics has received considerable attention because of its demonstrated promise in rodent brains to manipulate cells and circuits. In a recent report, Tremblay and colleagues (2020) introduce an open resource detailing optogenetic studies of the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain and make robust claims about the translatability of the technology. We propose that their quantitative (e.g., a 91% success rate) and theoretical claims are questionable because the data were analyzed at a level relevant to the rodent but not NHP brain, injections were clustered within a few monkeys in a few studies in a few brain regions, and their definitions of success was not clearly relevant to human neuropsychiatric disease. A reanalysis of the data with a modified definition of success that included a behavioral and biological effect revealed an 62.5% success rate that was lower when considering only strong outcomes (53.1%). This calls into question the current efficacy of optogenetic techniques in the NHP brain and suggests that we are a long way from being able to leverage them in \"the service of patients with neurological or psychiatric conditions\" as the Tremblay report claims.",

While its function in maintaining proper motor neuron function is well-established, investigation into its role in the health and function of reproductive processes is only just beginning to be studied. Single-cell-sequencing analysis of all ovarian cells from the murine perinatal period revealed that Uchl1 is very highly expressed in the developing oocyte population, an observation which was corroborated by high levels of oocyte-enriched UCHL1 protein expression in oocytes of all stages throughout the mouse reproductive lifespan. To better understand the role UCHL1 may be playing in oocytes, we utilized a UCHL1-deficient mouse line, finding reduced number of litters, reduced litter sizes, altered folliculogenesis, morphologically abnormal oocytes, disrupted estrous cyclicity and apparent endocrine dysfunction in these animals compared to their wild-type and heterozygous littermates. These data reveal a novel role of UCHL1 in female fertility as well as overall ovarian function, and suggest a potentially essential role for the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in mediating reproductive health.\n\nSummary sentenceUbiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is required for proper ovarian folliculogenesis, estrous cyclicity, and fertility in the female mouse.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hematozoa are a subclass of protozoan parasites that invade and develop within vertebrate red blood cells to cause the pathological symptoms associated with diseases of both medical and veterinary importance such as malaria and babesiosis. A major limitation in the study of the most prominent hematozoa, Plasmodium spp, the causative agents of malaria, is the lack of a broadly accessible mouse model to evaluate parasite infection in vivo as is the case for P. falciparum or altogether the lack of an in vitro culture and mouse models as is the case for P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale. Similarly, no in vitro culture system exists for Babesia microti, the predominant agent of human babesiosis. In this study, we show that human red blood cells infected with the human pathogen Babesia duncani continuously propagated in culture, as well as merozoites purified from parasite cultures, can cause lethal infection in immunocompetent C3H/HeJ mice. Furthermore, highly reproducible parasitemia and survival outcomes were established using specific parasite loads and different mouse genetic backgrounds. Using the combined in culture-in mouse (ICIM) model of B. duncani infection, we demonstrate that current recommended combination therapies for the treatment of human babesiosis, while synergistic in cell culture, have weak potency in vitro and failed to clear infection or prevent death in mice. Interestingly, using the ICIM model, we identified two new endochin-like quinolone prodrugs, ELQ-331 and ELQ-468, that alone or in combination with atovaquone are highly efficacious against B. duncani and B. microti. The novelty, ease of use and scalability of the B. duncani ICIM dual model make it an ideal system to study intraerythrocytic parasitism by protozoa, unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying parasite virulence and pathogenesis, and accelerate the development of innovative therapeutic strategies that could be translated to unculturable parasites and important pathogens for which an animal model is lacking.\n\nAuthor SummaryUse of model organisms is vital to the understanding of virulence and pathogenesis of a large number of human and animal pathogens. In case of hematozoan parasites that invade and develop within vertebrate erythrocytes, the studies are challenging because of the dearth of small animal model systems and the lack of continuous parasite growth in in vitro culture conditions. Here, we report a small animal model of lethal infection of Babesia duncani, one of the causative agents of human babesiosis. We show that in vitro cultured parasites and as well as parasites propagated in vivo can establish highly reproducible parasitemia which is dependent on the parasite load and also defined by different mouse genetic backgrounds. We further use this combined in culture-in mouse (ICIM) model of B. duncani infection to demonstrate the anti-babesial efficacy of two novel endochin like quinoline compounds. We propose that this ICIM dual model of B. duncani is an ideal system to get insights into protozoan intraerythrocytic parasitism, virulence, pathogenesis, and therapeutics and will open the vista to other important pathogens which are unculturable or lack an animal model.",

Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions plays a key role in increasing the efficiency of drug research and safety when multiple drugs are c o-prescribed. With various data sources that describe the relationships and properties between drugs, the comprehensive approach that integrates multiple data sources would be considerably effective in making high-accuracy prediction. In this paper, we propose a Deep Attention Neural Network based Drug-Drug Interaction prediction framework, abbreviated as DANN-DDI, to predict unobserved drug-drug interactions. First, we construct multiple drug feature networks and learn drug representations from these networks using the graph embedding method; then, we concatenate the learned drug embeddings and design an attention neural network to learn representations of drug-drug pairs; finally, we adopt a deep neural network to accurately predict drug-drug interactions. The experimental results demonstrate that our model DANN-DDI has improved prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed model can predict novel drug-drug interactions and drug-drug interaction-associated events.",

However, the mechanisms underlying diet-dependent modulation of chemosensory gene expression are unclear. Here, we show that the expression of the srh-234 chemoreceptor gene localized in a single ADL sensory neuron type of C. elegans is downregulated when animals are fed a Comamonas bacterial diet, but not on an E. coli diet. Remarkably, this diet-modulated effect on srh-234 gene expression levels is dependent on the micronutrient vitamin B12 endogenously produced by Comamonas bacteria. Excess propionate and genetic perturbations in the canonical and shunt propionate breakdown pathways are able to override the repressing effects of vitamin B12 on srh-234 expression. The vitamin B12-mediated regulation of srh-234 expression levels in ADL requires the MEF-2 transcription factor, providing a potential mechanism by which dietary vitamin B12 may transcriptionally tune individual chemoreceptor genes in a single sensory neuron type, which in turn may change animal responses to biologically relevant chemicals in their diet.",

Additionally, while these knowledgebases have been extremely useful, they typically cannot interpret novel mutations, which may also have functional and clinical impacts in cancer. To address these challenges, we developed an automated interpretation tool called CancerVar (Cancer Variants interpretation) to score more than 12.9 million somatic mutations and classify them into four tiers: strong clinical significance, potential clinical significance, uncertain clinical significance, and benign/likely benign, based on the AMP/ASCO/CAP 2017 guideline. Considering that the AMP/ASCO/CAP rule-based scoring system may have inherent limitations, such as lack of a clear guidance on weighing different pieces of functional evidence or unclear definition for certain clinical evidence, it may cause misinterpretation for certain variants that have functional impacts but no proven clinical significance. To address this issue, we further introduced a deep learning-based scoring system to predict oncogenicity of mutations by semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SGAN) method using both functional and clinical evidence. We trained and validated the SGAN model on 5,234 somatic mutations from an in-house database of clinical reports on cancer patients, and achieved a good performance when testing on 6,226 variants that were curated by us through literature search. We also compared the prediction with several independent datasets and showed great utility in classifying variants with previously unknown interpretations. CancerVar is also incorporated into a web server that can generate automated texts with summarized descriptive interpretations, such as diagnostic, prognostic, targeted drug responses and clinical trial information for many hotspot mutations. In summary, CancerVar can facilitate clinical interpretation and hypothesis generation for somatic mutations, and greatly reduce manual workload for retrieving relevant evidence and implementing existing guidelines.",

The genomic basis of thermal tolerance has been evaluated across strong spatial and environmental gradients, but this variation also exists within populations due to neutral evolutionary processes. Small scale heterogeneity in coral bleaching is ubiquitous, so we used corals from a single reef to examine genomic signatures of bleaching performance, their biochemical correlates and the downstream consequences of selective breeding. In the absence of directional selection due to environmental differences, adult corals from a single population exhibit strong genomic patterns related to natural bleaching tolerance and symbiosis state, including functional differentiation in signaling pathways, protein and amino acid modification and metabolism. Conversely, growth, development and innate immune responses did not distinguish bleaching tolerance in adult corals. The genomic signatures of these gene ontologies influence biochemical patterns in healthy corals, primarily via cell-signaling pathway impacts on peptides and amino acids. Thermal tolerance in this population is highly heritable, with significantly higher survivorship under temperature stress in larvae and juveniles reared from thermally tolerant parents than those from sensitive parents. Using a select and re-sequence approach, certain gene ontologies were reproducibly impacted, while antioxidant activity and cell signaling ontologies were disproportionately selected in thermally tolerant corals, demonstrating the genomic drivers of successful selective breeding.

Due to their major role in synaptic transmission, both in the nervous system and the somatic neuromuscular junction, LGICs present attractive therapeutic targets. During the last few years several computational methods for the detection of LGICs have been developed. These methods are based on machine learning approaches utilizing features extracted solely from amino acid composition. Here we report the development of LiGIoNs, a profile Hidden Markov Model (pHMM) method for the prediction and ligand-based classification of LGICs. The method consists of a library of 10 pHMMs, one per LGIC subfamily, built from the alignment of representative LGIC sequences. In addition, 14 Pfam pHMMs are used to further annotate and classify unknown protein sequences into one of the 10 LGIC subfamilies. Evaluation of the method showed that it outperforms existent methods in the detection of LGICs. On top of that, LiGIoNs is the only currently available method that classifies LGICs into subfamilies.\n\nThe method is available online at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/ligions/.",

The intestinal epithelium has an important role in effector responses, which is coordinated by immune-type specific cytokines. It is incompletely understood how cytokines drive epithelial responses. Here, using organoid-cytokine co-cultures, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how key cytokines affect the intestinal epithelium, and relate this to in vivo infection models. We use imaging, based on a convolutional neural network, and transcriptomic analysis to reveal that cytokines use developmental pathways to define intestinal epithelial effector responses. For example, we find IL-22 and IL-13 dichotomously induce goblet cells, in which only IL-13 driven goblet cells are associated with NOTCH signaling. We further show that IL-13 induces BMP signalling to act as a negative feedback loop in IL-13 induced tuft cell hyperplasia, an important aspect of type 2 immunity. Together, we show that targeting developmental pathways may be a useful tool to tailor epithelial effector responses that are necessary for immunity to infection.",

Prior to stimulus onset followed by a face-vs. house-report, FFA showed stronger connectivity to primary visual cortex and to the rest of the cortex in the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz) but there were no differences in local oscillatory alpha power.

Surface electromyography or sEMG provides a measure of the neural activation of muscles which can be used to estimate the force produced by the muscle. However, sEMG based measures of force suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatiotemporal specificity. In this paper, we propose an ultrasound imaging or sonomyography-based approach for estimating continuous isometric force from a sparse set of ultrasound scanlines. Our approach isolates anatomically relevant features from A-mode ultrasound signals, greatly reducing the dimensionality of the feature space and the computational complexity involved in traditional ultrasound-based methods. We evaluate the performance of four regression methodologies for force prediction using the reduced feature set. We also evaluate the feasibility of a practical wearable sonomyography-based system by simulating the effect of transducer placement and varying the number of transducers used in force prediction. Our results demonstrate that Gaussian process regression models outperform other regression methods in predicting continuous force levels from just four equispaced transducers and are tolerant to speckle noise. These findings will aid in the design of wearable sonomyography-based force prediction systems with robust, computationally efficient operation.",

The fundamental nature of this temporal asymmetry led us to hypothesize its presence in the neural activity evoked by conscious perception of the physical world, and thus its covariance with the level of conscious awareness. Inspired by recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics, we implemented a data-driven and model-free deep learning framework to decode the temporal inversion of electrocorticography signals acquired from non-human primates. Brain activity time series recorded during conscious wakefulness could be distinguished from their inverted counterparts with high accuracy, both using frequency and phase information. However, classification accuracy was reduced for data acquired during deep sleep and under ketamine-induced anesthesia; moreover, the predictions obtained from multiple independent neural networks were less consistent for sleep and anesthesia than for conscious wakefulness. Finally, the analysis of feature importance scores highlighted transitions between slow ({approx}20 Hz) and fast frequencies (> 40 Hz) as the main contributors to the temporal asymmetry observed during conscious wakefulness. Our results show that a preferred temporal direction is simultaneously manifest in the neural activity evoked by conscious mentation and in the phenomenology of the passage of time, establishing common ground to tackle the relationship between brain and subjective experience.",

Although it has been demonstrated that the tumor suppressor p53 functions in endothelial cells to prevent the development of radiation-induced myocardial injury, the key mechanism(s) by which p53 regulates the radiosensitivity of cardiac endothelial cells is not completely understood. Here, we utilized genetically engineered mice that express mutations in p53 transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) (p5325,26) or mutations in p53 TAD1 and TAD2 (p5325,26,53,54) specifically in endothelial cells to study the p53 transcriptional program that protects cardiac endothelial cells from ionizing radiation in vivo. p5325,26,53,54 loses the ability to drive transactivation of p53 target genes after irradiation while p5325,26 can induce transcription of a group of non-canonical p53 target genes, but not the majority of classic radiation-induced p53 targets critical for p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. After 12 Gy whole-heart irradiation, we found that both p5325,26 and p5325,26,53,54 sensitized mice to radiation-induced cardiac injury, in contrast to wild-type p53. Histopathological examination suggested that mutation of TAD1 contributes to myocardial necrosis after whole-heart irradiation, while mutation of both TAD1 and TAD2 abolishes the ability of p53 to prevent radiation-induced heart disease. Taken together, our results show that the transcriptional program downstream of p53 TAD1, which activates the acute DNA damage response after irradiation, is necessary to protect cardiac endothelial cells from radiation injury in vivo.",

Using a two-phase-agar system, we characterized Arabidopsis thaliana responses to low and high mechanical impedance at three root penetration stages. We found that seedlings whose roots fail to penetrate agar barriers show drastic changes in shoot and root morphology, while those capable of penetrating have only minor morphological effects. The assessment of 21 Arabidopsis accessions revealed that primary root penetrability (PRP) varies widely among accessions. To search for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated to root system penetrability, we evaluated a recombinant inbred population (RIL) derived from Landsberg erecta (Ler-0, with a high PRP) and Shahdara (Sha, with a low PRP) accessions. QTL analysis revealed a major-effect QTL localized in chromosome 3 (q-RPI3), which accounted for 29.98% (LOD = 8.82) of the total phenotypic variation. Employing an introgression line (IL-321), with a homozygous q-RPI3 region from Sha in the Ler-0 genetic background, we demonstrated that q-RPI3 plays a crucial role in root penetrability. This multiscale study revels new insights into root plasticity during the penetration process in hard agar layers, natural variation and genetic architecture behind primary root penetrability in Arabidopsis.\n\nHighlightWe found a wide natural variation in the capacity of Arabidopsis accessions to penetrate hard agar layers. Using a Ler-0 x Sha recombinant inbred population, a major-effect QTL (q-RPI3) strongly associated with root penetrability of compact agar layers was identified.",

We give for the first time an insight at early stages of starch synthesis and breakdown. Starch and sugar synthesis and breakdown are processes that take place simultaneously. During the first eight to ten weeks the balance between synthesis and breakdown is clearly in favour of sugar breakdown and a net starch synthesis occurs. During this period, plantain fruit accumulates up to 48% of starch. The initiation of the ripening process is accompanied with a shift in balance towards net starch breakdown. The key enzymes related to this are phosphoglucan water dikinase (PWD), phosphoglucan phosphatase, -1,6-glucosidase starch debranching enzyme (DBE), alpha glucan phosphorylase (PHS) and 4-alpha glucanotransferase disproportioning enzyme (DPE). The highest correlations with sucrose have been observed for PHS and DPE. There is also a significant correlation between the enzymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, starch breakdown, pulp softening and ascorbate biosynthesis. The faster ending of maturation and starting of ripening in the Agbagba cultivar are linked to the key enzymes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase and DPE. This knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate starch and sugar metabolisms during maturation and ripening is fundamental to determine the harvest moment, reduce postharvest losses and improve final product quality of breeding programs.",

One of their potential applications is the customization of plant metabolome through the activation of selected enzymes in a given metabolic pathway. Using the previously described multiplexable CRISPR activator dCasEV2.1, we assayed the selective enrichment in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves of four different flavonoids, namely naringenin, eriodictyol, kaempferol and quercetin. After careful selection of target genes and guide RNAs combinations, we created successful activation programs for each of the four metabolites, each program activating between three and seven genes, and with individual gene activation levels ranging from 4- to 1500-fold. Metabolic analysis of the flavonoid profiles of each multigene activation program showed a sharp and selective enrichment of the intended metabolites and their glycosylated derivatives. Remarkably, principal component analysis of untargeted metabolic profiles clearly separated samples according to their activation treatment, and hierarchical clustering separated the samples in five groups, corresponding to the expected four highly enriched metabolite groups, plus an un-activated control. These results demonstrate that dCasEV2.1 is a powerful tool for re-routing metabolic fluxes towards the accumulation of metabolites of interest, opening the door for custom-made design of metabolic contents in plants.",

Here, we analyze a neural mass model of the thalamocortical loop of which the cortical node can generate slow oscillations (approx. 1 Hz) while its thalamic component can generate fast sleep spindles of{sigma} -band activity (12-15 Hz). We study the dynamics for different coupling strengths between the thalamic and cortical nodes, for different conductance values of the thalamic nodes potassium leak and anomalous rectifying currents, and for different parameter regimes of the cortical node. The latter are: (1) a low activity (DOWN) state with noise-induced, transient excursions into a high activity (UP) state, (2) an adaptation induced slow oscillation limit cycle with alternating UP and DOWN states, and (3) a high activity (UP) state with noise-induced, transient excursions into the low activity (DOWN) state. During UP states, thalamic spindling is abolished or reduced. During DOWN states, the thalamic node generates sleep spindles, which in turn can cause DOWN to UP transitions in the cortical node. Consequently, this leads to spindle-induced UP state transitions in parameter regime (1), thalamic spindles induced in some but not all DOWN states in regime (2), and thalamic spindles following UP to DOWN transitions in regime (3). The spindle-induced{sigma} -band activity in the cortical node, however, is typically strongest during the UP state, which follows a DOWN state \"window of opportunity\" for spindling. When the cortical node is parametrized in regime (3), the model well explains the interactions between slow oscillations and sleep spindles observed experimentally during Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. The model is computationally efficient and can be integrated into large-scale modeling frameworks to study spatial aspects like sleep wave propagation.",

Here we evaluated the impact of surgical trauma on the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, including the expression of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), caspase-1, and IL-1{beta} in the hippocampus of C57BL6/J male mice, adult (3-months) and aged (>18-months). Surgery triggered ASC specks formation in CA1 hippocampal microglia, but without inducing significant morphological changes in NLRP3 and ASC knockout mice. Since no therapies are currently available to treat PNDs, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of a biomimetic peptide derived from the endogenous inflammation-ending molecule, Annexin-A1 (ANXA1). We tested the hypothesis that this peptide (ANXA1sp) inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus preventing microglial activation and hippocampal-dependent memory deficits. Together these results uncover a previously underrecognized role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in triggering postoperative neuroinflammation and offer a new target for advancing treatment of PNDs through resolution of inflammation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "For many environments, biome-specific microbial gene catalogues are being recovered using shotgun metagenomics followed by assembly and gene-calling on the assembled contigs. The assembly can be conducted either by individually assembling each sample or by co-assembling reads from all the samples. The co-assembly approach can potentially recover genes that display too low abundance to be assembled from individual samples. On the other hand, combining samples increases the risk of mixing data from closely related strains, which can hamper the assembly process. In this respect, assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of (near) identical genes is likely preferable. Thus, both approaches have pros and cons and it remains to be evaluated which assembly strategy is most effective. Here, we have evaluated three assembly strategies for generating gene catalogues from metagenomes using a dataset of 124 samples from the Baltic Sea: 1) assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of the resulting genes, 2) co-assembly on all samples, and 3) mix-assembly, combining individual and co-assembly. The mix-assembly approach resulted in a more extensive non-redundant gene set than the other approaches, and with more genes predicted to be complete and that could be functionally annotated. The mix-assembly consists of 67 million genes (Baltic Sea gene set; BAGS) that have been functionally and taxonomically annotated. The majority of the BAGS genes are dissimilar (<95% amino acid identity) to the Tara Oceans gene dataset, and hence BAGS represents a valuable resource for brackish water research.\n\nIMPORTANCESeveral ecosystem types, such as soils and oceans, are studied through metagenomics. It allows the analysis of genetic material of the microbes within a sample without the need for cultivation. When performing the DNA sequencing with an instrument that generates short sequence reads, these reads need to be assembled in order to obtain more complete gene sequences. In this paper, we have evaluated three strategies for assembling metagenome sequences using a large metagenomic dataset from the Baltic Sea. The method that we call mix-assembly generated the greatest number of non-redundant genes and the largest fraction of genes that were predicted to be complete. The resulting gene catalogue will serve as an important resource for brackish water research. We believe this method to be efficient also for generating gene catalogs for other biomes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Malaria is caused by infection with protozoan parasites of the Plasmodium genus, which is part of the phylum Apicomplexa. Most organisms in this phylum contain a relic plastid called the apicoplast. The apicoplast genome is replicated by a single DNA polymerase (apPOL), which is an attractive target for anti-malarial drugs. We screened small-molecule libraries (206,504 compounds) using a fluorescence-based high-throughput DNA polymerase assay. Dose/response analysis and counter-screening identified 186 specific apPOL inhibitors. Toxicity screening against human HepaRG human cells removed 84 compounds and the remaining were subjected to parasite killing assays using chloroquine resistant P. falciparum parasites. Nine compounds were potent inhibitors of parasite growth and may serve as lead compounds in efforts to discover novel malaria drugs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19 poses a life-threatening endangerment to individuals with chronic diseases. However, not all comorbidities affect COVID-19 prognosis equally. Some increase the risk of COVID-19 related death by more than six folds while others show little to no impact. To prevent severe outcomes, it is critical that we comprehend pre-existing molecular abnormalities in common health conditions that predispose patients to poor prognoses. In this study, we aim to discover some of these molecular risk factors by associating gene expression dysregulations in common health conditions with COVID-19 mortality rates in different cohorts.\n\nMethodsWe focused on fourteen pre-existing health conditions, for which age-and-sex-adjusted hazard ratios of COVID-19 mortality have been documented. For each health condition, we analyzed existing transcriptomics data to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between affected individuals and unaffected individuals. We then tested if fold changes of any DEG in these pre-existing conditions were correlated with hazard ratios of COVID-19 mortality to discover molecular risk factors. We performed gene set enrichment analysis to identify functional groups overrepresented in these risk factor genes and examined their relationships with the COVID-19 disease pathway.\n\nResultsWe found that upregulated expression of 70 genes and downregulated expression of 181 genes in pre-existing health conditions were correlated with increased risk of COVID-19 related death. These genes were significantly enriched with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, proinflammatory reaction, and interferon production that participate in viral transcription and immune responses to viral infections.\n\nConclusionsImpaired innate immunity in pre-existing health conditions are associated with increased hazard of COVID-19 mortality. The discovered molecular risk factors are potential prognostic biomarkers and targets for therapeutic interventions.",

Similar to the human phenotype, zebrafish slc39a14U801-/- mutants show prominent brain manganese accumulation and abnormal locomotor behaviour. In order to identify novel potential targets of manganese neurotoxicity, we performed transcriptome analysis of individual homozygous mutant and sibling slc39a14U801 zebrafish at five days post fertilisation unexposed and exposed to MnCl2. Anatomical gene enrichment analysis confirmed that differentially expressed genes map to the central nervous system and eye. Biological interpretation of differentially expressed genes suggests that calcium dyshomeostasis, activation of the unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal disruption, apoptosis and autophagy, and interference with proteostasis are key events in manganese neurotoxicity. Differential expression of visual phototransduction genes also predicted visual dysfunction in mutant larvae which was confirmed by the absence of visual background adaptation and a diminished optokinetic reflex. Surprisingly, we found a group of differentially expressed genes in mutant larvae that normalised upon MnCl2 treatment suggesting that, in addition to neurotoxicity, manganese deficiency is present either subcellularly or in specific cells or tissues. This may have important implications for treatment as manganese chelation may aggravate neurological symptoms. Our analyses show that slc39a14U801-/- mutant zebrafish present a powerful model to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying disrupted manganese homeostasis.\n\nSignificance statementManganese neurotoxicity leading to progressive dystonia-parkinsonism is a characteristic feature of Hypermanganesemia with dystonia 2 (HMNDYT2) caused by mutations in SLC39A14, a manganese uptake transporter. Transcriptional profiling in slc39a14U801 loss-of-function zebrafish suggests that, in addition to manganese neurotoxicity, subcellular or cell type specific manganese deficiency contributes to the disease phenotype. Both manganese overload and deficiency appear to be associated with Ca2+ dyshomeostasis. We further demonstrate that activation of the unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and autophagy, and disrupted proteostasis are likely downstream events in manganese neurotoxicity. Our study shows that the zebrafish slc39a14U801 loss-of-function mutant is a powerful model to elucidate the mechanistic basis of diseases affected by manganese dyshomeostasis.",

While the distribution of these key taxa may vary with a suite of abiotic and biotic factors, the relative role of host species identity on soil fungal community composition and function remains unresolved. In this study, we used a combination of amplicon sequencing and enzymatic assays to assess soil fungal composition and associated function under three tree species, Quercus rubra, Betula nigra, and Acer rubrum, planted individually and in all combinations in a greenhouse, with added fungal inoculum collected below mature field trees. Across treatments, fungal communities were dominated by the phylum Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota. Nonetheless, fungal communities differed between each of the solo planted treatments, suggesting at least some taxa may associate preferentially with these tree species. Additionally, fungal community composition under mixed sapling treatments broadly differed from solo saplings. The data also suggests that there were larger enzymatic activities in the solo treatments as compared with all mixed treatments. This difference may be due to the greater relative abundance of saprobic taxa found in the solo treatments. This study provides evidence of the importance of tree identity on soil microbial communities and functional changes to forest soils.",

Knowing how K. marxianus responds and adapts to changing environments is important to achieve a full understanding of the its biology and to develop bioprocesses. For this, a full suite of omics tools to measure and compare global patterns of gene expression and protein synthesis is needed. Whereas transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq quantifies mRNA abundance, ribosome profiling allows codon-resolution of translation on a genome-wide scale by deep sequencing of ribosome locations on mRNAs and is emerging as a valuable tool to study translation control of gene expression. We report here the development of a ribosome profiling method for K. marxianus and we make the procedure available as a step by step protocol. To aid in the analysis and sharing of ribosome profiling data, we also added the K. marxianus genome as well as transcriptome and ribosome profiling data to the publicly accessible GWIPS-viz and Trips-Viz browsers. Users are able to upload custom ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data to both browsers, therefore allowing easy analysis and sharing of data. As many studies only focus on the use of RNA-Seq to study K. marxianus in different environments, the availability of ribosome profiling is a powerful addition to the K. marxianus toolbox.\n\nGraphical abstractDevelopment of a Ribosome Profiling protocol to study gene expression in the thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478964v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1268da7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ddff1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1597da4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@47c2ae_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We created novel therapeutics using tmSCF embedded in proteoliposomes or lipid nanodiscs. Mouse models of anaphylaxis and ischemia revealed the tmSCF-based therapies did not activate mast cells and improved the revascularization in the ischemic hind limb. Proteoliposomal tmSCF preferentially acted on endothelial cells to induce angiogenesis while tmSCF nanodiscs had greater activity in inducing stem cell mobilization and recruitment to the site of injury.

In a field experiment with plants originating from low and high elevations and conducted across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps, we find that both lowland and highland species can better persist in the presence of competition within than beyond their elevation ranges, suggesting that competition helps set both lower and upper elevation range limits of these species. Furthermore, the reduced ability of pairs of lowland or highland species to coexist beyond their range edges is mainly driven by diminishing niche differences; changes in both niche differences and relative fitness differences drive weakening competitive dominance of lowland over highland species with increasing elevation. These results highlight the need to account for competitive interactions and investigate underlying coexistence mechanisms to understand current and future species distributions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Plants can generate motion by absorbing and releasing water. Such motion often facilitates reproductive success through the dispersal of seeds and fruits or their self-burial into the soil. Asteraceae plants, such as the dandelion, often have a hairy pappus attached to their fruits to allow them to fly and in many cases, these can open and close depending on moisture levels to modify dispersal. Here we demonstrate the relationship between structure, composition and function of the underlying hygroscopic actuator. By investigating the structure and properties of the actuator cell walls we have identified the mechanism by which the dandelion pappus closes and developed a structural computational model that can capture observed pappus closing. This model was used to explore the contribution of differential material domains in the actuator function and the critical design features. We find that the actuator relies on the radial arrangement of vascular bundles and surrounding tissues including cortex and the floral podium around a central cavity. This allows heterogeneous swelling in a radially symmetric manner to co-ordinate precise movements of the pappus hairs attached at the upper flank. This actuator is a derivative of bilayer structures, but is radial and can synchronise the movement of a planar or lateral attachment. The simple, material-based mechanism presents a promising biomimetic potential in robotics and functional materials.",

While protein aggregates can contribute to pathologies exemplified by Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, their abundance is normally minimised by molecular chaperones such as HSP70/90, which promote native folding and drive the recycling of aberrantly folded species. Cytoplasmic chaperones (e.g. HSP70/40) can resolve insoluble protein aggregates should the preventive mechanisms falter. However, it is unknown whether an analogous disaggregation system is needed and exists in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), where [~]30% of the proteome is synthesised. Here we show that the ER of a variety of mammalian cell types, including neurons, is endowed with the capability to resolve protein aggregates that accumulate upon expression of metastable proteins. Utilising a purpose-developed protein aggregation probing system with a sub-organellar resolution, we observed steady-state aggregate accumulation in the ER. Strikingly, pharmacological induction of ER stress did not augment aggregates but rather stimulated their clearance within hours. We found that this disaggregation activity was catalysed by the stress-responsive ER molecular chaperone - BiP. Its elimination abolished the disaggregation activity in cells. Further, we reconstructed the disaggregation-reaction in-vitro by a minimal system of ATP-fuelled BiP and its J-protein cofactor. These data reveal a hitherto unknown, non-redundant function of the ER stress response. Thus, our findings may facilitate the identification of aggregation-antagonising strategies and rationalising the age-dependent protein misfolding pathology.\n\nSummaryER stress induction activates a protein disaggregation machinery, powered by BiP - an abundant ER chaperone, revealed by a FLIM-based protein aggregation monitoring in live cells.",

Previous work links endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with behavioral efficiency across perceptual and cognitive domains, with potentially the strongest impact on those behaviors that require a high level of dynamic control. Based on the integrated analyses of behavior and modulation of interhemispheric phase-based connectivity during dynamic motor state transitions and endogenous GABA concentration, we provide converging evidence for age-related differences in the behaviorally more beneficial state of endogenous GABA concentration. We suggest that the increased interhemispheric connectivity seen in the older adults represents a compensatory mechanism caused by rhythmic entrainment of neural populations in homotopic motor cortices. This mechanism appears to be most relevant in the presence of a less optimal tuning of the inhibitory tone to uphold the required flexibility of behavioral action.",

Recent theoretical advances integrated both research lines proposing a sequence of stochastic and niche-based processes along successional gradients. Shifts in assembly processes are predicted to occur abruptly once abiotic and biotic factors dominate over dispersal as main driver. Considering the multidiversity composed of five organismal groups including plants, animals, and microbes, we empirically show that stochastic dispersal-dominated community assembly is replaced by environmental filters and biotic interactions after around 60 years of succession in a glacier forefield. The niche-based character of later successional processes is further supported by a decline in multi-beta-diversity. Our results may update concepts of community assembly by considering multiple taxa, help to bridge the gap between research on successions and community assembly, and provide new insights into the emergence of multidiverse and complex ecosystems.",

Here, we report on 10 strains of Ostreobium isolated from coral skeletons from the Great Barrier Reef. Phenotypic diversity showed differences in the gross morphology and in few structures. Phylogenetic analyses of the tufA and rbcL put the strains in the context of the lineages identified previously through environmental sequencing.

However, the contribution of the peristaltic motion in the seminiferous tubule to sperm release and transport remains unclear. We, therefore, investigated luminal flow and movements in the seminiferous tubules by three-dimensional analysis and in vivo imaging.\n\nMaterials and MethodsSerial testicular sections were cut in 5-m-thick and 50-m-interval and stained by PAS-hematoxylin. After the three-dimensional reconstruction of the seminiferous tubules, the localization of the flowing spermatozoa and stages observed in the sections were recorded in each reconstructed tubule. The luminal movements in the seminiferous tubule were observed by in vivo imaging using a fluorescent-reporter mouse and two-photon excitation microscopy system.\n\nResultsFlowing spermatozoa were mainly scattered in the lumina at stage VII/VIII, and clustered spermatozoa were also found in some regions. The clustered spermatozoa were observed at zero to two regions in each seminiferous tubule. Flowing spermatozoa were also found in the opposite direction to the rete testis. The flagellum direction of the spermatozoa attached to the seminiferous epithelium was reversed within a few seconds to a few tens of seconds when observed by in vivo imaging. The epithelium at the inner curve of the seminiferous tubule moved more actively and attached fewer spermatozoa compared to that at the outer curve.\n\nDiscussionThis study revealed the presence of repeatedly reversed luminal flow in the seminiferous tubule. Such movements are suggested to help the sperm release from the Sertoli cells and the following aggregation of the released spermatozoa.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Codon usage bias has long been appreciated to influence protein production. Yet, relatively few studies have analyzed the impacts of codon usage on tissue-specific mRNA and protein expression. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to perform an organism-wide screen in Drosophila melanogaster for distinct tissue responses to codon usage bias. These reporters reveal a cliff-like decline of protein expression near the limit of rare codon usage in endogenously expressed Drosophila genes. Near the edge of this limit, however, we find the testis and brain are uniquely capable of expressing rare codon-enriched reporters. We define a new metric of tissue-specific codon usage, the tissue-apparent Codon Adaptation Index, to reveal a conserved enrichment for rare codon usage in the endogenously expressed genes of both Drosophila and human testis. We further demonstrate a role for rare codons in restricting protein expression of an evolutionarily young gene, RpL10Aa, to the Drosophila testis. Rare codon-mediated restriction of this testis-specific protein is critical for female fertility. Our work highlights distinct responses to rarely used codons in select tissues, revealing a critical role for codon bias in tissue biology.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is an emerging technology that provides high chemical specificity for endogenous biomolecules and can circumvent common constraints of fluorescence microscopy including limited capabilities to probe small biomolecules and difficulty resolving many colors simultaneously due to spectral overlap. However, the resolution of SRS microscopy remains governed by the diffraction limit. To overcome this, we describe a new technique called Molecule Anchorable Gel-enabled Nanoscale Imaging of Fluorescence and stImulatEd Raman Scattering microscopy (MAGNIFIERS), that integrates SRS microscopy with expansion microscopy (ExM). ExM is a powerful strategy providing significant improvement in imaging resolution by physical magnification of hydrogel-embedded preserved biological specimens. MAGNIFIERS offers chemical-specific nanoscale imaging with sub-50 nm resolution and has scalable multiplexity when combined with multiplex Raman probes and fluorescent labels. We used MAGNIFIERS to visualize nanoscale features in a label-free manner with C-H vibration of proteins, lipids and DNA in a broad range of biological specimens, from mouse brain, liver and kidney to human lung organoid. In addition, we applied MAGNIFIERS to track nanoscale features of protein synthesis in protein aggregates using metabolic labeling of small metabolites. Finally, we used MAGNIFIERS to demonstrate 8-color nanoscale imaging in an expanded mouse brain section. Overall, MAGNIFIERS is a valuable platform for super-resolution label-free chemical imaging, high-resolution metabolic imaging, and highly multiplexed nanoscale imaging, thus bringing SRS to nanoscopy.",

Identifying genetic risk alleles for FASD is challenging since time, dose, and frequency of exposure are often unknown, and manifestations of FASD are diverse and evident long after exposure. Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model to study the genetic basis of the effects of developmental alcohol exposure since many individuals of the same genotype can be reared under controlled environmental conditions. We used 96 sequenced, wild-derived inbred lines from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to profile genome-wide transcript abundances in young adult flies that developed on ethanol-supplemented medium or standard culture medium. We found substantial genetic variation in gene expression in response to ethanol with extensive sexual dimorphism. We constructed sex-specific genetic networks associated with alcohol-dependent modulation of gene expression that include protein-coding genes, Novel Transcribed Regions (NTRs, postulated to encode long non-coding RNAs) and female-specific coordinated regulation of snoRNAs that regulate pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNA. We reared DGRP lines which showed extreme upregulation or downregulation of snoRNA expression during developmental alcohol exposure on standard or ethanol supplemented medium and demonstrated that developmental exposure to ethanol has genotype-specific effects on adult locomotor activity and sleep. There is significant and sex-specific natural genetic variation in the transcriptional response to developmental exposure to ethanol in Drosophila that comprises networks of genes affecting nervous system development and ethanol metabolism as well as networks of regulatory non-coding RNAs.\n\nSummary statementWe developed a Drosophila model for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and found that developmental exposure to alcohol modulates expression of networks of genes affecting nervous system development and ethanol metabolism as well as networks of regulatory noncoding RNAs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Seed germination represents a major developmental switch in plants that is vital to agricultural, but how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that successful germination in Arabidopsis requires a chromatin mechanism that progressively silences NCED6, which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, through the cooperative action of the RNA-binding protein RZ-1 and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Simultaneous inactivation of RZ-1 and PRC2 blocks germination and synergistically derepresses NCEDs and hundreds of genes. At NCED6, by promoting H3 deacetylation and suppressing H3K4me3, RZ-1 facilitates transcriptional silencing and also a H3K27me3 accumulation process that occurs during seed germination and early seedling growth. Genome-wide analysis reveals RZ-1 is preferentially required for transcriptional silencing of many PRC2 targets early during seed germination when H3K27me3 is not yet established. We propose RZ-1 confers a novel silencing mechanism to compensate and coordinate with PRC2. Our work highlights the progressive chromatin silencing of ABA biosynthesis genes via synergized action of the RNA-binding protein RZ1 and PRC2, which is vital for seed germination.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Metagenomic data sets of host-associated microbial communities often contain host DNA that is usually discarded because the amount of data is too low for accurate host genetic analyses. However, if a reference panel is available, genotype imputation can be employed to reconstruct host genotypes and maximise the use of such a priori useless data. We tested the performance of a two-step strategy to input genotypes from four types of reference panels, comprised of deeply sequenced chickens to low-depth host genome (~2x coverage) data recovered from metagenomic samples of chicken intestines. The target chicken population was formed by two broiler breeds and the four reference panels employed were (i) an internal panel formed by population-specific individuals, (ii) an external panel created from a public database, (iii) a combined panel of the previous two, and (iv) a diverse panel including more distant populations. Imputation accuracy was high for all tested panels (concordance >0.90), although samples with coverage under 0.28x consistently showed the lowest accuracies. The best imputation performance was achieved by the combined panel due to the high number of imputed variants, including low-frequency ones. However, common population genetics parameters measured to characterise the chicken populations, including observed heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, pairwise distances and kinship, were only minimally affected by panel choice, with all four panels yielding suitable results for host population characterization and comparison. Likewise, genome scans between the two studied broiler breeds using imputed data with each panel consistently identified the same sweep regions. In conclusion, we show that the applied imputation strategy enables leveraging insofar discarded host DNA to get insights into the genetic structure of host populations, and in doing so, facilitate the implementation of hologenomic approaches that jointly analyse host genomic and microbial metagenomic data.\n\nAuthor summaryWe introduce and assess a methodological approach that enables recovering animal genomes from complex mixtures of metagenomic data, and thus expand the portfolio of analyses that can be conducted from samples such as faeces and gut contents. Metagenomic data sets of host-associated microbial communities often contain DNA of the host organism. The principal drawback to use this data for host genomic characterisation is the low percentage and quality of the host DNA. In order to leverage this data, we propose a two-step imputation method, to recover high-density of variants. We tested the pipeline in a chicken metagenomic dataset, validated imputation accuracy statistics, and studied common population genetics parameters to assess how these are affected by genotype imputation and choice of reference panel. Being able to analyse both domains from the same data set could considerably reduce sampling and laboratory efforts and resources, thereby yielding more sustainable practices for future studies that embrace a hologenomic approach that jointly analyses animal genomic and microbial metagenomic features.",

Some models propose specific fixed loci and mechanisms for the storage of visual information in working memory, such as sustained spiking in parietal and prefrontal cortex during working memory maintenance. An alternative view is that information can be remembered in a flexible format that best suits current behavioral goals. For example, remembered visual information might be stored in sensory areas for easier comparison to future sensory inputs, or might be re-coded into a more abstract action-oriented format and stored in motor areas. Here, we tested this hypothesis using a visuo-spatial working memory task where the required behavioral response was either known or unknown during the memory delay period. Using fMRI and multivariate decoding, we found that there was less information about remembered spatial position in early visual and parietal regions when the required response was known versus unknown. Further, a representation of the planned motor action emerged in primary somatosensory, primary motor, and premotor cortex during the same task condition where spatial information was reduced in early visual cortex. These results suggest that the neural networks supporting working memory can be strategically reconfigured depending on specific behavioral requirements during a canonical visual working memory paradigm.",

The current model of PKR activation considers the formation of back-to-back PKR dimers as a prerequisite for signal propagation. Here we show that PKR signaling involves the assembly of dynamic PKR clusters. PKR clustering is driven by ligand binding to PKRs sensor domain and by front-to-front interfaces between PKRs kinase domains. PKR clusters are discrete, heterogeneous, autonomous coalescences that share some protein components with processing bodies. Strikingly, eIF2 is not recruited to PKR clusters, and PKR cluster disruption enhances eIF2 phosphorylation. Together, these results support a model in which PKR clustering buffers downstream signaling, which may enable proofreading the ISR.",

Although the effects of body size on metabolism are well-known, the potential reciprocal effects of body size and density are less clear. Specifically, 1) whether changes in body size or density more strongly influence the other and 2) whether coupled rapid changes in body size and density are due to plasticity, rapid evolutionary change, or a combination of both.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we address these two issues by experimentally tracking population density and mean body size in the protist Tetrahymena pyriformis as it grows from low density to carrying capacity. We then use Convergent Cross Mapping time series analyses to infer the direction, magnitude, and causality of the link between body size and ecological dynamics. We confirm the results of our analysis by experimentally manipulating body size and density while keeping the other constant. Last, we fit mathematical models to our experimental time series that account for purely plastic change in body size, rapid evolution in size, or a combination of both, to gain insight into the processes that most likely explain the observed dynamics.\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate that changes in body size more strongly influence changes in density than the other way around, but also show that there is reciprocity in this effect (i.e., a feedback). We show that a model that only accounts for purely plastic change in size most parsimoniously explains observed, coupled phenotypic and ecological dynamics.\nC_LIO_LITogether, these results suggest 1) that body size can shift dramatically through plasticity, well within ecological timescales, 2) that rapid changes in body size may have a larger effect on ecological dynamics than the reverse, but 3) phenotypic and ecological dynamics influence each as populations grow.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) genetic variants are risk factors for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A soluble TREM2 isoform (sTREM2) is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in the early stages of AD suggesting it may be a biomarker of progressive alterations in immune response to AD-related pathology. Multiple studies have reported an altered peripheral immune response in AD. However, less is known about the relationship between plasma sTREM2 and the altered peripheral immune response in AD. The objective of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory activity in human participants defined by clinically characterized cognitive symptoms and groups defined by the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau, and neurodegeneration (NIA-AA Research Framework: \"ATN continuum\".) The hypothesis of this exploratory study was that sTREM2 related inflammatory activity differs by AD stage. We observed different patterns of inflammatory activity across disease groups and ATN categories that implicates peripheral sTREM2 related inflammatory activity as altered in the early stages of AD. Notably, fractalkine showed a significant relationship with sTREM2 across different analyses in the control groups that was lost as disease progressed, and fractalkine, IL-5 and IL-17A were decreased in AD. These preliminary data provide important support to the hypothesis that sTREM2-related inflammatory activity is a stage-specific biomarker of AD progression, providing the groundwork for future studies and therapeutic strategies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Parkinsons disease is a devastating motor disorder involving the aberrant aggregation of the synaptic protein synuclein (aSyn) and degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic tract. We previously showed that proSAAS, a small secreted chaperone protein widely expressed in neurons within the brain, is able to block aSyn-induced dopaminergic cytotoxicity in primary nigral neuron cultures. We show here that coinjection of proSAAS-encoding lentivirus profoundly reduced the motor asymmetry caused by unilateral nigral AAV-mediated human aSyn overexpression. This positive functional outcome was accompanied by significant amelioration of the human aSyn-induced loss of both nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase-positive terminals, demonstrating clear proSAAS-mediated protection of the nigro-striatal tract. ProSAAS overexpression also reduced the content of human aSyn protein in both the nigra and striatum and reduced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase protein in both regions. Since proSAAS is a secreted protein, we tested the possibility that proSAAS is able to block the transsynaptic spread of aSyn from the periphery to the central nervous system, increasingly recognized as a potentially significant pathological mechanism. The number of human aSyn-positive neurites in the pons and caudal midbrain of mice following administration of human aSyn-encoding AAV into the vagus nerve was considerably reduced in mice coinjected with proSAAS-encoding AAV, supporting proSAAS-mediated blockade of transsynaptic aSyn transmission. We suggest that proSAAS may represent a promising target for therapeutic development in Parkinsons disease.\n\nSignificanceThis paper describes two independent avenues of research that both provide support for the in vivo neuroprotective function of this small chaperone protein. In the first approach, we show that proSAAS overexpression provides remarkably effective protection against dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a rat model of Parkinsons disease. This conclusion is supported both by three independent assays of motor function as well as by quantitative analysis of surviving dopaminergic neurons in brain areas involved in the control of motor function. In the second line of research, we show that in mice, the spread of human synuclein across synapses can be blunted by proSAAS overexpression.",

This flexibility depends on continuous comparison of short-term postural dynamics and the longer-term goals of an animal, thereby necessitating neural mechanisms that can operate across multiple timescales. To understand how such body-brain interactions emerge to control movement across timescales, we performed whole-cell patch recordings from visual neurons involved in course control in Drosophila. We demonstrate that the activity of leg mechanosensory cells, propagating via specific ascending neurons, is critical to provide a clock signal to the visual circuit for stride-by-stride steering adjustments and, at longer timescales, information on speed-associated motor context to flexibly recruit visual circuits for course control. Thus, our data reveal a stride-based mechanism for the control of high-performance walking operating at multiple timescales. We propose that this mechanism functions as a general basis for adaptive control of locomotion.",

Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, we describe a method that relies on polymeric hydrogel substrates for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self-assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel-free conditions. By engineering pre-defined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure was reduced when compared to 3D culture while maintaining alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2 and primary mouse tissue-derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible culture system for the culture of primary and iPSC-derived lung progenitors and the method could be expanded to the culture of other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The translocator protein (TSPO) has been implicated in mitochondrial transmembrane cholesterol transport, brain inflammation, and other mitochondrial functions. It is upregulated in glial cells during neuroinflammation in Alzheimers disease. High affinity TSPO imaging radioligands are utilized to visualize neuroinflammation. However, this is hampered by the common A147T polymorphism which compromises ligand binding. Furthermore, this polymorphism has been linked to increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, and possibly reduces TSPO protein stability. Here, we used immunoprecipitation coupled to mass-spectrometry (IP-MS) to establish a mitochondrial protein binding profile of wild-type (WT) TSPO and the A147T polymorphism variant. Using mitochondria from human glial cells expressing either WT or A147T TSPO, we identified 30 WT TSPO binding partners, yet only 23 for A147T TSPO. Confirming that A147T polymorphism of the TSPO might confer loss of function, we found that one of the identified interactors of WT TSPO, 14-3-3 theta (YWHAQ), a protein involved in regulating mitochondrial membrane proteins, interacts much less with A147T TSPO. Our data presents a network of mitochondrial interactions of TSPO and its A147T polymorphism variant in human glial cells and indicate functional relevance of A147T in mitochondrial protein networks.",

    "preprint_abstract": "IntroductionAcademia uses scholarly metrics, such as the h-index, to make hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. These high-stakes decisions require that those using scholarly metrics be able to recognize, interpret, critically assess and effectively and ethically use them. This study aimed to characterize educational videos about the h-index to understand available resources and provide recommendations for future educational initiatives.\n\nMethodsThe authors analyzed videos on the h-index posted to YouTube. Videos were identified by searching YouTube and were screened by two authors. To code the videos the authors created a coding sheet, which assessed content and presentation style with a focus on the videos educational quality based on Cognitive Load Theory. Two authors coded each video independently with discrepancies resolved by group consensus.\n\nResultsThirty-one videos met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one videos (68%) were screencasts and seven used a \"talking head\" approach. Twenty-six videos defined the h-index (83%) and provided examples of how to calculate and find it. The importance of the h-index in high-stakes decisions was raised in 14 (45%) videos. Sixteen videos (52%) described caveats about using the h-index, with potential disadvantages to early researchers the most prevalent (n=7; 23%). All videos incorporated various educational approaches with potential impact on viewer cognitive load. Most videos (n=21; 68%) displayed amateurish production quality.\n\nDiscussionThe videos featured content with potential to enhance viewers metrics literacies such that many defined the h-index and described its calculation, providing viewers with skills to recognize and interpret the metric. However, less than half described the h-index as an author quality indicator, which has been contested, and caveats about h-index use were inconsistently presented, suggesting room for improvement. While most videos integrated practices to facilitate balancing viewers cognitive load, few (32%) were of professional production quality. Some videos missed opportunities to adopt particular practices that could benefit learning.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Polycystin-1 (PC1) is an important unusual G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with 11 transmembrane (TM) domains and its mutations account for 85% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). PC1 shares multiple characteristics with Adhesion GPCRs. These include a GPCR proteolysis site that autocatalytically divides these proteins into extracellular, N-terminal and membrane-embedded, C-terminal (CTF) fragments, and a tethered agonist (TA) within the N-terminal stalk of the CTF that is suggested to activate signaling. However, the mechanism by which a TA can activate PC1 is not known. Here, we have combined functional cellular signaling experiments of PC1 CTF expression constructs encoding wild type, stalkless and three different ADPKD stalk variants with all-atom Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations to investigate TA-mediated signaling activation. Correlations of residue motions and free-energy profiles calculated from the GaMD simulations correlated with the differential signaling abilities of wild type and stalk variants of PC1 CTF. They suggested an allosteric mechanism involving residue interactions connecting the stalk, Tetragonal Opening for Polycystins (TOP) domain and putative pore loop in TA-mediated activation of PC1 CTF. Key interacting residues such as N3074-S3585 and R3848-E4078 predicted from the GaMD simulations were validated by new mutagenesis experiments. Together, these complementary analyses have provided novel insights into a TA-mediated activation mechanism of PC1 CTF signaling, which will be important for future rational drug design targeting PC1.\n\nSignificance StatementMutations of polycystin-1 (PC1) are the major cause (85% of cases) of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the fourth leading cause of kidney failure. PC1 is thought to function as an atypical GPCR, yet the mechanism by which PC1 regulates G-protein signaling remains poorly understood. A significant portion of ADPKD mutations of PC1 encode a protein with defects in maturation or reduced function that may be amenable to functional rescue. In this work, we have combined complementary biochemical and cellular assay experiments and accelerated molecular simulations, which revealed a novel allosteric transduction pathway in activation of the PC1 CTF. Our findings shall facilitate future rational drug design efforts targeting the PC1 signaling function.",

Since coccolithophores calcify intracellularly, the mechanisms through which changes in seawater carbonate chemistry affect calcification remain unclear. Here we show that voltage-gated H+ channels in the plasma membrane of Coccolithus braarudii serve to regulate pH and maintain calcification under normal conditions, but have greatly reduced activity in cells acclimated to low pH. This disrupts intracellular pH homeostasis and impairs the ability of C. braarudii to remove H+ generated by the calcification process, leading to specific coccolith malformations. These coccolith malformations can be reproduced by pharmacological inhibition of H+ channels. Heavily-calcified coccolithophore species such as C. braarudii, which make the major contribution to carbonate export to the deep ocean, have a large intracellular H+ load and are likely to be most vulnerable to future decreases in ocean pH.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Gene body methylation (GBM) is an ancestral aspect of DNA methylation (Sarda, Zeng, Hunt, & Yi, 2012; Yi, 2012; Zemach, McDaniel, Silva, & Zilberman, 2010) whose role in development has been obscured by the more prominent roles of promoter and CpG island methylation. The wasp Nasonia has little promoter and CpG island methylation, yet retains strong GBM (Park et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Werren et al., 2010), making it an excellent model for elucidating the role of GBM. Here we show that Nasonia DNA methyl transferase 1a (Nv-Dnmt1a) knockdown leads to failures in cellularization and gastrulation of the embryo. Both of these disrupted events are hallmarks of the maternal-zygotic transition (MZT) in insects. Analysis of the embryonic transcriptome and methylome revealed strong reduction of GBM and widespread disruption of gene expression during embryogenesis after Nv-Dnmt1a knockdown. There was a strong correlation between loss of GBM and reduced gene expression in thousands of methylated loci, while affected unmethylated genes tended to be upregulated. We propose that reduced GBM and subsequent lower expression levels of methylated genes was the direct effect of Nv-Dnmt1 knockdown, and that this disruption led to widespread downstream dysregulation of MZT, and manifesting in developmental failure at gastrulation.\n\nSignificance StatementThe importance of gene-body methylation (GBM) in development is unclear, due to the difficulty in teasing apart the effects of cis-regulatory methylation from those of GBM in vertebrate model systems. Unlike vertebrate models, the methylation machinery in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis appears to exclusively mediate GBM, thus simplifying interpretation of the role of GBM in development. Knockdown of DNMT1 (Nv-Dnmt1a) in Nasonia leads to embryonic lethality, which we show is caused by a failure of cellularization and gastrulation. Nv-Dnmt1a knockdown resulted in a global loss of GBM in the embryo, which was strongly correlated with a down-regulation of gene expression. We propose that GBM facilitated by Nv-Dnmt1a is required for proper zygotic genome activation in the wasp.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Polygenic scores link the genotypes of ancient individuals to their phenotypes, which are often unobservable, offering a tantalizing opportunity to reconstruct complex trait evolution. In practice, however, interpretation of ancient polygenic scores is subject to numerous assumptions. For one, the genome-wide association (GWA) studies from which polygenic scores are derived, can only estimate effect sizes for loci segregating in contemporary populations. Therefore, a GWA study may not correctly identify all loci relevant to trait variation in the ancient population. In addition, the frequencies of trait-associated loci may have changed in the intervening years. Here, we devise a theoretical framework to quantify the effect of this allelic turnover on the statistical properties of polygenic scores as functions of population genetic dynamics, trait architecture, power to detect significant loci, and the age of the ancient sample. We model the allele frequencies of loci underlying trait variation using the Wright-Fisher diffusion, and employ the spectral representation of its transition density to find analytical expressions for several error metrics, including the correlation between an ancient individuals polygenic score and true phenotype, referred to as polygenic score accuracy. Our theory also applies to a two-population scenario and demonstrates that allelic turnover alone may explain a substantial percentage of the reduced accuracy observed in cross-population predictions, akin to those performed in human genetics. Finally, we use simulations to explore the effects of recent directional selection, a bias-inducing process, on the statistics of interest. We find that even in the presence of bias, weak selection induces minimal deviations from our neutral expectations for the decay of polygenic score accuracy. By quantifying the limitations of polygenic scores in an explicit evolutionary context, our work lays the foundation for the development of more sophisticated statistical procedures to analyze both temporally and geographically resolved polygenic scores.",

Mathematical models that assume well-mixed cell populations, together with experimental data, have suggested that negative feedback from differentiated cells on the stem cell self-renewal probability can maintain a stable equilibrium and hence homeostasis. Cell lineage dynamics, however, are characterized by spatial structure, which can lead to different properties. Here, we investigate these dynamics using spatially explicit computational models, including cell division, differentiation, death, and migration / diffusion processes. According to these models, the negative feedback loop on stem cell self-renewal fails to maintain homeostasis, both under the assumption of strong spatial restrictions and fast migration / diffusion. Although homeostasis cannot be maintained, this feedback can regulate cell density and promote the formation of spatial structures in the model. Tissue homeostasis, however, can be achieved if spatially restricted negative feedback on self-renewal is combined with an experimentally documented spatial feedforward loop in which stem cells regulate the fate of transit amplifying cells. This indicates that the dynamics of feedback regulation in tissue cell lineages are more complex than previously thought, and that combinations of spatially explicit control mechanisms are likely instrumental.",

For sockeye salmon in British Columbia, Canada, juveniles migrate past numerous Atlantic salmon farms from which they may acquire a number of infectious agents. We analyse patterns of molecular detection in juvenile sockeye salmon for one bacterial pathogen, Tenacibaculum maritimum, known to cause disease in fish species around the globe and to cause mouthrot disease in farmed Atlantic salmon in BC. Our data show a clear peak in T. maritimum detections in the Discovery Islands region of BC, where sockeye migrate close to salmon farms. Using well established differential-equation models to describe sockeye migration and T. maritimum infection spread, we fit models to our detection data to assess support for multiple hypotheses describing farm- and background-origin infection. Despite a data-constrained inability to resolve certain epidemiological features of the system, such as the relative roles of post infection mortality and recovery, our models clearly support the role of Discovery-Islands salmon farms in producing the observed patterns. Our best models (with 99.8% empirical model support) describe relatively constant (background) infection pressure, except around Discovery-Islands salmon farms, where farm-origin infection pressure peaked at 12.7 (approximate 95% CI: 4.5 to 31) times background levels. Given the evidence for farm-origin transfer of T. maritimum to Fraser-River sockeye salmon, the severity of associated disease in related species, and the imperilled nature of Fraser River sockeye generally, our results suggest the need for a more precautionary approach to managing farm/wild interactions in sockeye salmon.",

Our study seeks to examine how the biophysical parameters of the Delta variant correlate to the clinical observations. Receptor binding domain (RBD) is the first point of contact with the human host cells and is the immunodominant form of the spike protein. Delta variant RBD contains two novel mutations L452R and T478K. We examined the effect of single mutations as well as the double mutation on RBD expression in human Expi293 cells, RBD stability using urea and thermal denaturation, and RBD binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to neutralizing antibodies using isothermal titration calorimetry. Delta variant RBD showed significantly higher expression compared to the wild-type RBD, and the increased expression is due to L452R mutation. Despite their non-conservative nature, none of the mutations significantly affected RBD structure and stability. All mutants showed similar binding affinity to ACE2 and to Class 1 antibodies (CC12.1 and LY-CoV016) as that of the wild-type. Delta double mutant L452R/T478K showed no binding to Class 2 antibodies (P2B-2F6 and LY-CoV555) and a hundred-fold weaker binding to a Class 3 antibody (REGN10987), and the decreased antibody binding is determined by the L452R mutation. These results indicate that the immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, rather than receptor binding, is the main biophysical parameter determining the fitness landscape of the Delta variant RBD and is determined by the L452R mutation.",

Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying meditation remain elusive. In the present work, we investigated meditation-related changes in structural and functional connectivities (SC and FC, respectively). For this purpose, we scanned experienced meditators and control (naive) subjects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to acquire structural and functional data during two conditions, resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). In this way, we aimed to characterize and distinguish both short-term and long-term modifications in the brains structure and function. First, we performed a network-based analysis of anatomical connectivity. Then, to analyze the fMRI data, we calculated whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) estimates, relying on a dynamical network model to replicate BOLD signals spatio-temporal structure, akin to FC with lagged correlations. We compared the estimated EC, FC, and SC links as features to train classifiers to predict behavioral conditions and group identity. The whole-brain SC analysis revealed strengthened anatomical connectivity across large-scale networks for meditators compared to controls. We found that differences in SC were reflected in the functional domain as well. We demonstrated through a machine-learning approach that EC features were more informative than FC and SC solely. Using EC features we reached high performance for the condition-based classification within each group and moderately high accuracies when comparing the two groups in each condition. Moreover, we showed that the most informative EC links that discriminated between meditators and controls involved the same large-scale networks previously found to have increased anatomical connectivity. Overall, the results of our whole-brain model-based approach revealed a mechanism underlying meditation by providing causal relationships at the structure-function level.",

However, the transcriptional strategies by which the intestinal epithelium integrates and adapts to dietary and microbial information remains unresolved. We compared adult mice reared germ free (GF) or conventionalized with a microbiota (CV) either fed normally or after a single high-fat meal (HFM). Jejunal epithelium preparations were queried using genomewide assays for RNA-seq, the activating histone mark H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and ChIP-seq of the microbially-responsive transcription factor HNF4A. We identified distinct nutritional and microbial responses at certain genes, but also apparent simultaneous influence of both stimuli at many other loci and regulatory regions. Increased expression levels and H3K27ac enrichment following HFM at a subset of these sites was dependent on microbial status. H3K27ac sites that were preferentially increased by HFM in the presence of microbes neighbor lipid anabolism and proliferation genes as well as intestinal stem cell (ISC) markers, were usually active only in ISCs, and were not HNF4A targets. In contrast, H3K27ac sites that were preferentially increased by HFM in the absence of microbes neighbored targets of the nuclear receptor and energy homeostasis regulator PPARA, were frequently accessible only in enterocytes, and were HNF4A bound. These results reveal that HNF4A supports a differentiated enterocyte and FAO program in GF, and that suppression of HNF4A by the combination of microbes and HFM may result in preferential activation of IEC proliferation programs. Microbial and nutritional responses are therefore integrated with some of the same transcriptional programs that regulate intestinal proliferation and differentiation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Variant benchmarking is a critical component of method development and evaluating the accuracy of studies of genetic variation. Currently, the best approach to evaluate the accuracy of a callset is the comparison against a well curated gold standard. In repetitive regions of the genome it may be difficult to establish what is the truth for a call, for example when different alignment scoring metrics provide equally supported but different variant calls in on the same data. Here we provide an alternative approach, TT-Mars, that takes advantage of the recent production of high-quality haplotype-resolved genome assemblies by evaluating variant calls based on how well their call reflects the content of the assembly, rather than comparing calls themselves. We used TT-Mars to assess callsets from different SV discovery methods on multiple human genome samples and demonstrated that it is capable at accurately classifying true positive and false positive SVs. On the HG002 personal genome, TT-Mars recapitulates 96.0%-99.6% of the validations made using the Genome in a Bottle gold standard callset evaluated by truvari, and evaluates an additional 121-10,966 variants across different callsets. Furthermore, with a group of high-quality assemblies, TT-Mars can evaluate performance of SV calling algorithms as a distribution rather than a point estimate. We also compare TT-Mars against the long-read based validation tool, VaPoR, and when assembly-based variant calls produced by dipcall are used as a gold standard. Compared with VaPoR, TT-Mars analyzes more calls on a long read callset by assessing more short variant calls (< 100 bases), while requiring smaller input. Compared with validation using dipcall variants, TT-Mars analyzes 1,497-2,229 more calls on long read callsets and has favorable results when candidate calls are fragmented into multiple calls in alignments. TT-Mars is available at https://github.com/ChaissonLab/TT-Mars.git with accompanying assembly data and corresponding liftover files.",

Recently, a freshwater red alga, Montagnia macrospora, was introduced from South America to East Asia via the global aquarium trade. The earliest occurrence record of this alga in Taiwan is dated 2005. To determine whether M. macrospora has become an invasive species in Taiwan and to understand its traits that facilitated its invasion, we took a total-evidence approach that combines examination of ecological background and population genetic analysis. Our island-wide survey showed that M. macrospora alga was widespread in the field across Taiwan, where the climate greatly differs from that of South America. Our population genetic analysis revealed that the cox2-3 sequences of all the specimens of M. macrospora from Taiwan were identical, consistent with the hypothesis that the alga expanded through asexual reproduction. Moreover, during our long-term ecological assessments and field surveys, we observed that M. macrospora is an ecological generalist that can self-sustain for a decade and bloom. Taken together, our data suggest that M. macrospora has successfully invaded the freshwater ecosystems in Taiwan due to its ability to disperse asexually and to grow under broad environmental conditions. We hope that our study brings attention to invasive freshwater algae, which have been overlooked in conservation planning and management.",

Many structural conformations are too small to be resolved via conventional fluorescence microscopy and the long acquisition time of super-resolution PALM imaging precludes the structural characterization of chromatin below the optical diffraction limit in living cells due to chromatin motion. Here we develop a correlative conventional fluorescence and PALM imaging approach to quantitatively map time-averaged chromatin structure and dynamics below the optical diffraction limit in living cells. By assigning localizations to a locus as it moves, we reliably discriminate between bound and searching dCas9 molecules, whose mobility overlap. Our approach accounts for changes in DNA mobility and relates local chromatin motion to larger scale domain movement. In our experimental system, we show that compacted telomeres have a higher density of bound dCas9 molecules, but the relative motion of those molecules is more restricted than in less compacted telomeres. Correlative conventional and PALM imaging therefore improves the ability to analyze the mobility and time-averaged nanoscopic structural features of locus specific chromatin with single molecule precision and yields unprecedented insights across length and time scales.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Sociality is often seen as a single phenotypic trait, but it relies on motivational and cognitive components implemented by specific causal mechanisms. Hence, these components may have evolved independently, or may have been linked by phenotypic correlations driven by a shared selective pressure for increased social competence. Furthermore, these components may be domain-specific or of general domain across social and non-social contexts. Here we have characterized the phenotypic architecture of sociality in zebrafish, which has been increasingly used as a model organism in social neuroscience. For this purpose, we have behaviorally phenotyped zebrafish from different wild type lines in four tests: social tendency, social and non-social recognition, and open-field test. Our results indicate that: (1) sociality has two main components that are independent from each other (social tendency and social recognition), hence not supporting the occurrence of a sociality syndrome; (2) both social traits are phenotypically linked to non-social traits (non-social exploration and non-social memory, respectively), forming two general behavioral modules, general inspection and general recognition, and suggesting that sociality traits have been co-opted from general-domain motivational and cognitive traits. Moreover, the study of the association between genetic polymorphisms (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and each behavioral module further supports this view, since several SNPs from a list of candidate \"social\" genes, are statistically associated with the general inspection (motivational), but not with a general recognition (cognitive), behavioral module. The SNPs associated with general inspection are widespread across different chromosomes and include neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and synaptic plasticity genes, suggesting that this behavioral module is regulated by multiple genes, each of them with small effects. Together, these results support the occurrence of general domain motivational and cognitive behavioral modules in zebrafish, which have been co-opted for the social domain.\n\nAuthor summarySocial living has been considered one of the major transitions in evolution and it has been considered to act as a major selective force shaping the evolution of brain and behavior in animals. Sociality relies on two basic behavioral mechanisms: (1) the willingness to approach and be near others (aka social tendency); and (2) the ability to distinguish between others (aka social recognition) in order to adjust the behavior expressed during social interactions according to the identity of the interactant. There is an ongoing debate on to what extent these social abilities have specifically evolved in response to social living and are domain specific, or if they were selected as a broad response to cognitive demands and are of general domain. Here, we used zebrafish to test the domain-specific vs. general domain hypotheses and to assess the association of social tendency and social recognition with a set of candidate \"social\" genes (i.e. genes that have been linked to social behavior in other studies with different vertebrate species). We found that both social traits are not correlated to each other and are of general domain, and that only social tendency is associated with candidate \"social\" genes, suggesting that social tendency and social recognition are independent behavioral modules that rely on separate genetic architectures and that can evolve separately.",

One system where chromosomal inversions may be important for eco-evolutionary dynamics are in freshwater fishes, which often live in heterogenous environments characterized by varying levels of connectivity and varying opportunities for gene flow. In the present study, reduced representation sequencing was used to study possible adaptation in n = 345 walleye (Sander vitreus) from three North American waterbodies: Cedar Bluff Reservoir (Kansas, USA), Lake Manitoba (Manitoba, Canada), and Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada). Haplotype and outlier-based tests revealed a putative chromosomal inversion that contained three expressed genes and was nearly fixed for alternate genotypes in each Canadian lake. These patterns exist despite several opportunities for gene flow between these proximate Canadian lakes, suggesting that the inversion may be important for facilitating adaptive divergence between the two lakes despite gene flow. Our study illuminates the importance of genomic architecture for facilitating local adaptation in freshwater fishes. Furthermore, our results provide additional evidence that inversions may facilitate local adaptation in many organisms that inhabit connected but heterogenous environments.",

Fossils and other preserved biosignatures in the paleontological record are the most direct evidence for reconstructing the broad historical contours of this adaptive interplay. However, biosignatures dating to Earths earliest history are exceedingly rare. Here, we combine phylogenetic inference of primordial rhodopsin proteins with modeled spectral features of the Precambrian Earth environment to reconstruct the paleobiological history of this essential family of photoactive transmembrane proteins. Our results suggest that ancestral microbial rhodopsins likely acted as light-driven proton pumps and were spectrally tuned toward the absorption of green light, which would have enabled their hosts to occupy depths in a water column or biofilm where UV wavelengths were attenuated. Subsequent diversification of rhodopsin functions and peak absorption frequencies was enabled by the expansion of surface ecological niches induced by the accumulation of atmospheric oxygen. Inferred ancestors retain distinct associations between extant functions and peak absorption frequencies. Our findings suggest that novel information encoded by biomolecules can be used as \"paleosensors\" for conditions of ancient, inhabited niches of host organisms not represented elsewhere in the paleontological record. The coupling of functional diversification and spectral tuning of this taxonomically diverse protein family underscores the utility of rhodopsins as universal testbeds for inferring remotely detectable biosignatures on inhabited planetary bodies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundOcean microbes constitute [~]70% of the marine biomass, are responsible for [~]50% of the Earths primary production, and are crucial for global biogeochemical cycles. Marine microbiotas include core taxa that are usually key for ecosystem function. Despite their importance, core marine microbes are relatively unknown, which reflects the lack of consensus on how to identify them. So far, most core microbiotas have been defined based on species occurrence and abundance. Yet, species interactions are also important to identify core microbes, as communities include interacting species. Here, we investigate interconnected bacteria and small protists of the core pelagic microbiota populating a long-term marine-coastal observatory in the Mediterranean Sea over a decade.\n\nResultsCore microbes were defined as those present in >30% of the monthly samples over 10 years, with the strongest associations. The core microbiota included 259 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) including 182 bacteria, 77 protists, and 1,411 strong and mostly positive ([~]95%) associations. Core bacteria tended to be associated with other bacteria, while core protists tended to be associated with bacteria. The richness and abundance of core OTUs varied annually, decreasing in stratified warmers waters and increasing in colder mixed waters. Most core OTUs had a preference for one season, mostly winter, which featured subnetworks with the highest connectivity. Groups of highly associated taxa tended to include protists and bacteria with predominance in the same season, particularly winter. A group of 13 highly-connected hub-OTUs, with potentially important ecological roles dominated in winter and spring. Similarly, 18 connector OTUs with a low degree but high centrality were mostly associated with summer or autumn and may represent transitions between seasonal communities.\n\nConclusionsWe found a relatively small and dynamic interconnected core microbiota in a model temperate marine-coastal site, with potential interactions being more deterministic in winter than in other seasons. These core microbes would be essential for the functioning of this ecosystem over the year. Other non-core taxa may also carry out important functions but would be redundant and non-essential. Our work contributes to the understanding of the dynamics and potential interactions of core microbes possibly sustaining ocean ecosystem function.",

House mice are genetically diverse, yet their genetic background at the global level has not been fully understood. Previous studies suggested that they originated in South Asia and diverged into three major subspecies almost simultaneously, approximately 350,000-500,000 years ago; however, they have spread across the world with the migration of modern humans in prehistoric and historic times ([~]10,000 years ago to present), and undergone secondary contact, which have complicated the genetic landscape of wild house mice. In this study, we sequenced the whole genomes of 98 wild house mice collected from Eurasia, particularly East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. We found that although wild house mice consist of three major genetic groups corresponding to the three major subspecies, individuals representing admixture between subspecies are much more ubiquitous than previously recognized. Furthermore, several samples showed an incongruent pattern of genealogies between mitochondrial and autosomal genomes. Using samples likely retaining the original genetic components of subspecies with least admixture, we estimated the pattern and timing of divergence among the subspecies. The results are important for understanding the genetic diversity of wild mice on a global level and the information will be particularly useful in future biomedical and evolutionary studies using laboratory mice established from these wild mice.",

With no clinically approved treatment for COVID-19, physicians initially struggled to treat the disease and there is still need for improved anti-viral therapies in this area. We conceived early in the pandemic that an inhalable formulation of the drug Remdesivir which directly targets the virus at the initial site of infection could improve therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19. We developed a set of requirements that would be conducive to rapid drug approval: 1) try to use GRAS or GRAS similar reagents 2) minimize excipient concentration and 3) achieve a working concentration of 5 mg/mL Remdesivir to achieve a deliverable dose which is 5-10% of the IV dose. In this work, we discovered that Poly(2-oxazoline) block copolymers can stabilize drug nanocrystal suspensions and provide suitable formulation characteristics for aerosol delivery while maintaining anti-viral efficacy.

Recent evidences highlight a role of the mitochondria calcium homeostasis in the development of CRC. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the role of the mitochondrial sodium-calcium-lithium exchanger (NCLX) and its targeting in CRC. We also identified curcumin as a new potential inhibitor of NCLX.\n\nIn vitro, curcumin exerted strong anti-tumoral activity through its action on NCLX with mtCa2+ and reactive oxygen species overload associated with a mitochondrial membrane depolarization, leading to reduced ATP production and apoptosis through mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening concomitant with G2/M cell cycle arrest. NCLX inhibition with either CGP37157 (a benzodiazepine derivative), small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down or knockout approaches reproduced the effects of curcumin. Altered mitochondrial respiration, cellular aerobic glycolysis and endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria membrane perturbations participated in these mechanisms. In a xenograft mouse model, NCLX inhibitors decreased CRC tumor growth. Both transcriptomic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays from 381 patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)-driven CRC demonstrated that higher NCLX expression was associated with MSI status and for the first time NCLX expression was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival in MSI CRC patients.\n\nOur findings provide strong evidence that blocking NCLX inhibits CRC in vitro and in vivo. We highlight a novel anti-tumoral mechanism of curcumin through its action on NCLX and mitochondria calcium overload that could benefit for therapeutic treatment of patients with MSI CRC.",

Heme extraction is mediated by a tridomain unit within the receptor that contains its second (N2) and third (N3) NEAT domains joined by a helical linker domain. Extraction occurs within a dynamic complex, in which receptors engage each globin chain; the N2 domain tightly binds to Hb, while substantial inter-domain motions within the receptor enable its N3 domain to transiently distort the globins heme pocket. Using molecular simulations, Markov modeling, and quantitative measurements of heme transfer kinetics, we show that directed inter-domain motions within the receptor play a critical role in the extraction process. The directionality of N3 domain motion and the rate of heme extraction is controlled by amino acids within a short, flexible inter-domain tether that connects the N2 and linker domains. In the wild-type receptor directed motions originating from the tether enable the N3 domain to populate configurations capable of distorting Hbs pocket, whereas mutant receptors containing altered tethers are less able to adopt these conformers and capture heme slowly via indirect processes in which Hb first releases heme into the solvent. Thus, our results show inter-domain motions within the IsdH receptor play a critical role in its ability to extract heme from Hb and highlight the importance of directed motions by the short, unstructured, amino acid sequence connecting the domains in controlling the directionality and magnitude of these functionally important motions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundA genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlates variation in the genotype with variation in the phenotype across a cohort, but the causal gene mediating that impact is often unclear. When the phenotype is protein abundance, a reasonable hypothesis is that the gene encoding that protein is the causal gene. However, as variants impacting protein levels can occur thousands or even millions of base pairs from the gene encoding the protein, it is unclear at what distance this simple hypothesis breaks down.\n\nResultsBy making the simple assumption that cis-pQTLs should be distance dependent while trans-pQTLs are distance independent, we arrive at a simple and empirical distance cutoff separating cis- and trans-pQTLs. Analyzing a recent large-scale pQTL study (Pietzner, 2021) we arrive at an estimated distance cutoff of 944 kilobasepairs (kbp) (95% confidence interval: 767-1,161) separating the cis and trans regimes.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that this simple model can be applied to other molecular GWAS traits. Since much of biology is built on molecular traits like protein, transcript and metabolite abundance, we posit that the mathematical models for cis and trans distance distributions derived here will also apply to more complex phenotypes and traits.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Exercise is associated with various health benefits, including the prevention and management of obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors. However, a strong heterogeneity in the adaptive response to exercise training exists. The objective of this study was to evaluate if changes in extracellular vesicles (EVs) after acute aerobic exercise (AE) were associated with the responder phenotype following 6-weeks of resistance exercise training. This is a secondary analysis of plasma samples from the EXIT trial (clinical trial #02204670). Eleven sedentary youth with obesity (15.7{+/-}0.5 years, BMI [&ge;] 95th percentile) underwent an acute bout of AE (60% heart rate reserve, 45 min). Blood was collected before exercise [at time (AT) 0 min], during [AT15, 30, 45 min], and 75 min after exercise [AT120]. Afterward, youth participated in 6-week resistance training program, and were categorized into responders (RE) or non-responders (NRE) based on changes in insulin sensitivity as measured by the Matsuda Index. EVs were isolated using size exclusion chromatography (Izon(R)). The primary outcome variable was EV biophysical profile, which includes size, zeta potential, protein yield and expression of markers associated with EV subtypes. The variables were analyzed in a single-blind fashion. Overall, there was a general increase in EV production in both groups. Average EV size was larger in RE (~147 nm) vs. NRE (~124 nm; p<0.05). Average EV size at AT0 was associated with absolute change in Matsuda index following 6-weeks of resistance training (r=0.44, p=0.08). EV size distribution revealed RE preferentially expressed EVs between 150 - 250 nm in size, whereas NRE expressed EVs between 50 - 100 nm (p<0.05). At baseline, RE-EVs contained ~25% lower Tsg101 protein, ~85% higher MMP2 content, while CD63 levels remained unchanged between the groups. Total protein yield in RE-EVs was higher than NRE at AT15 (p<0.05). Our data suggest that youth with obesity that respond to exercise training produce larger EVs, with lower exosome- and higher microvesicle-specific protein expression. RE-EVs also had higher EV protein yield during AE. The relationship between larger EV subtypes and/or cargo, and the individual response to exercise has yet to be fully elucidated.",

While certain lncRNAs have been functionally characterised in adipose tissue, their overall contribution in the activation of BAT remains elusive. We identified lncRNAs correlating to inter-scapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) function in high fat diet (HFD) and cold stressed mice. We focused on Gm15551 which has an adipose tissue specific expression profile, is highly upregulated during adipogenesis and downregulated by {beta}-adrenergic activation in mature adipocytes.

    "preprint_abstract": "Despite the advances in the techniques of indirect estimation of leaf area, the destructive measurement approaches have still remained as the reference and the most accurate methods. However, even utilizing the modern sensors and applications usually requires the laborious and time-consuming practice of unfolding and analyzing the single leaves, separately. In the present study, a volumetric approach was tested to determine the pile leaf area based on the ratio of leaf volume divided by thickness. For this purpose, the suspension technique was used for volumetry, which is based on the simple practice and calculations of the Archimedes principle. The results indicated that the wheat volumetric leaf area (VLA), had an approximately 1:1 correlation with the conventionally measured optical leaf area (OLA). Exclusion of the midrib volume from calculations, did not affect the estimation error (i.e. NRMSE less than 2.61%); however, improved the slope of the linear model by about 6%. The error of sampling for determining the mean leaf thickness of the pile, was also less than 2% throughout the season. Besides, a more practical and facilitated version of the pile volumetry was tested using a Specific Gravity Bench (SGB), which is currently available as a laboratory equipment. As an important observation, which was also expectable according to the 3D shape of the leaf (i.e. expansion in a 2D plane), it was evidenced that the variations in the OLA exactly follows the pattern of the changes in the leaf volume. Accordingly, it was suggested that the relative leaf areas of various experimental treatments may be compared directly based on the volume, and independently of leaf thickness. Furthermore, no considerable difference was observed among the OLAs measured using various image resolutions (NRMSE < 0.212%); which indicates that even the current superfast scanners with low resolutions as 200 dpi may be used for a precision optical measurement of leaf area. It is expected that utilizing the reliable and simple concept of volumetric leaf area, based on which the measurement time may be independent of the sample size, facilitate the laborious practice of leaf area measurement; and consequently, improve the precision of the field experiments.",

To investigate the role of HOIL1 in regulating intestinal inflammation, we employed a mouse model of HOIL1 deficiency. The ileum of Hoil1-/- mice displayed features of type 2 inflammation including tuft cell and goblet cell hyperplasia, and elevated expression of Il13, Il5 and Il25 mRNA. Inflammation persisted in the absence of T and B cells, and bone marrow chimeric mice revealed a requirement for HOIL1 expression in radiation-resistant cells to regulate inflammation. Although disruption of IL-4 receptor alpha (IL4R) signaling on intestinal epithelial cells ameliorated tuft and goblet cell hyperplasia, expression of Il5 and Il13 mRNA remained elevated. KLRG1hi CD90lo group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) were increased independent of IL4R signaling, tuft cell hyperplasia and IL-25 induction. Antibiotic treatment dampened intestinal inflammation indicating commensal microbes as a contributing factor. We have identified a key role for HOIL1, a component of the Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex, in regulating type 2 inflammation in the small intestine. Understanding the mechanism by which HOIL1 regulates type 2 inflammation will advance our understanding of intestinal homeostasis and inflammatory disorders and may lead to the identification of new targets for treatment.",

Most participants expressed very low levels of altruistic decision making, and two homogeneous groups could be identified, one formed by fair (N = 10) individuals and another by selfish (N = 8) individuals. At fronto-central cortical sites, the ERP early negativity (N1) was reduced in selfish participants with a latency about 10 ms earlier than in fair participants. In fair DG players, the features of the subsequent positive wave P2 suggested that more cognitive resources were required when they allocated the least gains to the other party. P2 latency and amplitude in the selfish group supported the hypothesis that these participants tended to maximize their profit, as expected by a rational Homo economicus. During UG, we observed that a medial frontal negativity (MFN) occurred earlier and with greater amplitude when selfish participants rejected less favorable endowment shares. In this case, all players received zero payoffs, which showed that MFN in selfish participants was associated with a spiteful punishment. At posterior-parietal sites we found that the greater the selfishness, the greater the amplitude of the late positive component (LPC). Our results bring new evidence to the existence of specific somatic markers associated with the activation of distinct cerebral circuits by the evaluation of fair and unfair proposals in participants characterized by different expressions of perceived fairness, thus suggesting that particular brain dynamics could be associated with moral decisions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "For Clostridium ljungdahlii, the RNF complex plays a key role for energy conversion from gaseous substrates such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In a previous study, a disruption of RNF-complex genes led to the loss of autotrophy, while heterotrophy was still possible via glycolysis. Furthermore, it was shown that the energy limitation during autotrophy could be lifted by nitrate supplementation, which resulted in an elevated cellular growth and ATP yield. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas12a to delete: 1) the RNF complex-encoding gene cluster rnfCDGEAB; 2) the putative RNF regulator gene rseC; and 3) a gene cluster that encodes for a putative nitrate reductase. The deletion of either rnfCDGEAB or rseC resulted in a complete loss of autotrophy, which could be restored by plasmid-based complementation of the deleted genes. We observed a transcriptional repression of the RNF-gene cluster in the rseC-deletion strain during autotrophy and investigated the distribution of the rseC gene among acetogenic bacteria. To examine nitrate reduction and its connection to the RNF complex, we compared autotrophic and heterotrophic growth of our three deletion strains with either ammonium or nitrate. The rnfCDGEAB- and rseC-deletion strains failed to reduce nitrate as a metabolic activity in non-growing cultures during autotrophy but not during heterotrophy. In contrast, the nitrate reductase deletion strain was able to grow in all tested conditions but lost the ability to reduce nitrate. Our findings highlight the important role of the rseC gene for autotrophy and contribute to understand the connection of nitrate reduction to energy metabolism.\n\nSignificance StatementAcetogenic bacteria are widely known for their ability to convert gaseous substrates, such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, into short-chain fatty acids and alcohols, which can be utilized as sustainable platform chemicals and fuels. However, acetogenic bacteria conserve energy at the thermodynamic limit of life during autotrophy, and thus the production of more complex and energy-dense chemicals is limited due to low ATP yields. Therefore, it is key to decipher the interplay of the electron balancing reactions to understand and optimize the acetogenic metabolism. Recent findings with alternative electron acceptors that accelerated the cellular growth and ATP yield during autotrophy, such as nitrate, provide an opportunity to overcome energetic barriers in the acetogenic metabolism. The interrogation of the nitrate metabolism and the interplay between nitrate reduction and energy conservation in C. ljungdahlii, will contribute to fine-tuning of the acetogenic metabolism for biotechnological applications.",

Amongst the major lineages, clades I and IV preferentially thrive in temperate and cold, nutrient-rich waters, whilst clades II and III prefer warm, nitrogen or phosphorus-depleted waters. The existence of such cold (I/IV) and warm (II/III) thermotypes is corroborated by physiological characterization of representative strains. A fifth clade, CRD1, was recently shown to dominate the Synechococcus community in iron-depleted areas of the world ocean and to encompass three distinct ecologically significant taxonomic units (ESTUs CRD1A-C) occupying different thermal niches, suggesting that distinct thermotypes could also occur within this clade.\n\nHere, using comparative thermophysiology of strains representative of these three CRD1 ESTUs we show that the CRD1A strain MITS9220 is a warm thermotype, the CRD1B strain BIOS-U3-1 a cold temperate thermotype, and the CRD1C strain BIOS-E4-1 a warm temperate stenotherm. Curiously, the CRD1B thermotype lacks traits and/or genomic features typical of cold thermotypes. In contrast, we found specific physiological traits of the CRD1 strains compared to their clade I, II, III and IV counterparts, including a lower growth rate and photosystem II maximal quantum yield at most temperatures and a higher turnover rate of the D1 protein. Together, our data suggests that the CRD1 clade prioritizes adaptation to low-iron conditions over temperature adaptation, even though the occurrence of several CRD1 thermotypes likely explains why the CRD1 clade as a whole occupies most iron-limited waters.",

In previous studies, a live, attenuated Cryptococcus neoformans {Delta}sgl1 mutant accumulating sterylglucosides was found to be avirulent and protected mice from a subsequent lethal infection even in absence of CD4+ T cells, a condition most associated with cryptococcosis (e.g., HIV). Here, we tested three strategies of vaccination against cryptococcosis. First, in our preventative model, protection was achieved even after a 3-fold increase of the vaccination window. Second, because live C. neoformans {Delta}sgl1-vaccinated mice challenged more than once with WT strain had a significant decrease in lung fungal burden, we tested C. neoformans {Delta}sgl1 as an immunotherapeutic. We found that therapeutic administrations of HK C. neoformans {Delta}sgl1 subsequent to WT challenge significantly improve the lung fungal burden. Similarly, therapeutic administration of HK C. neoformans {Delta}sgl1 post WT challenge resulted in 100% or 70% survival depending on the time of vaccine administration, suggesting that HK {Delta}sgl1 is a robust immunotherapeutic option. Third, we investigated a novel model of vaccination in preventing reactivation from lung granuloma using C. neoformans {Delta}gcs1. Remarkably, we show that administration of HK {Delta}sgl1 prevents mice from reactivating {Delta}gcs1 upon inducing immunosuppression with corticosteroids or by depleting CD4+ T cells. Our results suggest that HK {Delta}sgl1 represents a clinically relevant, efficacious vaccine that confers robust host protection in three models of vaccination against cryptococcosis even during CD4-deficiency.\n\nImportanceCryptococcosis results in [~]180,000 global deaths per year in immunocompromised individuals. Current antifungal treatment options are potentially toxic, lacking in areas of need, and exhibit limited efficacy. In addition to these lackluster therapeutic options, no fungal vaccines are currently available for clinical use. Due to the increasing rate of immunocompromised individuals, there is a dire need for the development of improved antifungal therapeutics. Presently, we have demonstrated the high efficacy of a clinically relevant heat-killed mutant strain of Cryptococcus neoformans in inducing advantageous host protection in three models of vaccination against cryptococcosis during immunodeficiencies most associated with this disease.",

The vertebrate orthologue, Kif9 is required for beating in mouse sperm flagella, but the mechanism of Kif9/Klp1 function remains poorly defined.

In addition, single-molecule assays in vitro revealed that Xenopus Kif9 is a processive motor, though like axonemal dyneins it displays no processivity in ciliary axonemes in vivo.

One suggestion is that a function of encoding-related theta power may be to  tag memories for subsequent processing during sleep. This study aimed to extend previous work on the relationships between sleep spindles, slow oscillation-spindle coupling and task-related theta activity with a combined Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) and nap paradigm. This allowed us to examine the influence of task- and sleep-related oscillatory activity on the recognition of both encoded list words and associative theme words. Thirty-three participants (29 females, mean age = 23.2 years) learned and recognised DRM lists separated by either a 2hr wake or sleep period. Mixed-effects modelling revealed the sleep condition endorsed more associative theme words and fewer list words in comparison to the wake group. Encoding-related theta power was also found to influence sleep spindle density, and this interaction was predictive of memory outcomes. The influence of encoding-related theta was specific to sleep spindle density, and did not appear to influence the strength of slow oscillation-spindle coupling as it relates to memory outcomes. The finding of interactions between wakeful and sleep oscillatory-related activity in promoting memory and learning has important implications for theoretical models of sleep-based memory consolidation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Background and PurposeDoes the brain become more resilient after a first stroke to reduce the consequences of a new lesion? Although recurrent strokes are a major clinical issue, whether and how the brain prepares for a second attack is unknown. This is due to the difficulties to obtain an appropriate dataset of stroke patients with comparable lesions, imaged at the same interval after onset. Furthermore, timing of the recurrent event remains unpredictable.\n\nMethodsHere we used a novel clinical lesion simulation approach to test the hypothesis that resilience in brain networks increases during stroke recovery. 16 patients with a lesion restricted to the primary motor cortex were recruited. At 3 time points of the index event (10 days, 3 weeks, 3 months), we mimicked recurrent infarcts by deletion of nodes in brain networks (resting-state fMRI). Graph measures were applied to determine resilience (global efficiency) and wiring cost (mean degree) of the network.\n\nResultsAt 10 days and 3 weeks after stroke, resilience was similar in patients and controls. However, at 3 months, while motor function had fully recovered, resilience to clinically representative simulated lesions was higher compared to controls (cortical lesion p=0.012; subcortical: p=0.009; cortico-subcortical: p=0.009). Similar results were found after random (p=0.012) and targeted (p=0.015) attacks.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that, after a lesion, brain networks reconfigure to increase resilience to future insults. Lesion simulation is an innovative approach, which may have major implications for stroke therapy. Individualized neuromodulation strategies could be developed to foster resilient network reconfigurations after a first stroke to limit the consequences of future attacks.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Combination antimicrobial therapy has been considered a promising strategy to combat the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Francisella tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia and in addition to being found in the nature, is recognized as a threat agent that requires vigilance. We investigated the evolutionary outcome of adapting the Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) of Francisella to two non-interacting drugs, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, individually, sequentially, and in combination. Despite their individual efficacies and independence of mechanisms, evolution to the combination appeared to progress faster than evolution to the two drugs sequentially. We conducted a longitudinal mutational analysis of the populations evolving to the drug combination, genetically reconstructed the identified evolutionary pathway, and carried out biochemical validation. We discovered that, after the appearance of an initial weak generalist mutation (FupA/B), each successive mutation alternated between adaptation to one drug or the other. In combination, these mutations allowed the population to more efficiently ascend the fitness peak through a series of evolutionary switch-backs. Clonal interference, weak pleiotropy, and positive epistasis also contributed to combinatorial evolution. This finding suggests that, under some selection conditions, the use of non-interacting drug pairs as a treatment strategy may result in a more rapid ascent to multi-drug resistance and serves as a cautionary tale.\n\nAuthor summaryThe antimicrobial resistance crisis requires the use of novel treatment strategies to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance. Combinations of drugs offer one strategy to delay resistance, but the efficacy of such drug combinations depends on the evolutionary response of the organism. Using experimental evolution, we show that under some conditions, a potential drug combination does not delay the onset of resistance in bacteria responsible for causing tularemia, Francisella. In fact, they evolve resistance to the combination faster than when the two drugs are applied sequentially. This result is surprising and concerning: using this drug combination in a hospital setting could lead to simultaneous emergence of resistance to two antibiotics. Employing whole genome sequencing, we identified the molecular mechanism leading to evolution of resistance to the combination. The mechanism is similar to the switch-back route used by hikers while scaling steep mountains i.e., instead of simultaneously acquiring mutations conferring resistance to both drugs, the bacteria acquire mutations to each drug in alternating manner. Rather than scaling the steep mountain directly, the bacteria ascend the mountain by a series of evolutionary switch-backs to gain elevation and in doing so, they get to the top more efficiently.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Freshwater lakes represent an important source of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are regulated to large parts by aerobic (MOx) and anaerobic (AOM) oxidation of methane that are important sinks in lakes. In contrast to marine benthic environments, our knowledge about the modes of AOM and the related methanotrophic microorganisms in anoxic lake sediments is still rudimentary. Here we demonstrate the occurrence of AOM in the anoxic sediments of Lake Sempach (Switzerland), with maximum in situ AOM rates observed within the surface sediment layers in presence of multiple groups of methanotrophic bacteria and various oxidants known to support AOM. However, substrate-amended incubations (with NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, Fe3+ and Mn4+) revealed that none of the electron acceptors previously reported to support AOM enhanced methane turnover in Lake Sempach sediments under anoxic conditions. In contrast, the addition of oxygen to the anoxic sediments resulted in an approximately tenfold increase in methane oxidation relative to the anoxic incubations. Phylogenetic and isotopic evidence indicate that both Type I and Type II aerobic methanotrophs were growing on methane under both oxic and anoxic conditions, although methane assimilation rates were an order of magnitude higher under oxic conditions. While the anaerobic electron acceptor responsible for AOM could not be identified, these findings expand our understanding of the metabolic versatility of canonically aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions, with important implications for future investigations to identify methane oxidation processes. Bacterial AOM by facultative aerobic methane oxidizers might be of much larger environmental significance in reducing methane emissions than previously thought.",

Therefore, aiming at strong B cell somatic hypermutation - not only at high antibody titers - is a priority when utilizing vaccines that are not targeted at individual variants. Here, we developed a next-generation sequencing based SARS-CoV-2 B cell tracking protocol to rapidly determine the level of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation at distinct points during the immunization period. The percentage of somatically hypermutated B cells in the SARS-CoV-2 specific repertoire was low after the primary vaccination series, evolved further over months and increased steeply after boosting. The third vaccination mobilized not only naive, but also antigen-experienced B cell clones into further rapid somatic hypermutation trajectories indicating increased affinity. Together, the strongly mutated post-booster repertoires and antibodies deriving from this may explain why the booster, but not the primary vaccination series, offers some protection against immune-escape variants such as Omicron B.1.1.529.\n\nBrief summaryPriming SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations generate antibodies from low-level matured B cells while the third vaccination strongly boosts somatic hypermutation potentially explaining different protection from immune-escape variants.",

However, it is still unknown how different neuroplastic mechanisms act together and if cognitive advancements relate to general or task-specific changes. To address these questions, we tested how hierarchical network interactions contribute to improvements in the performance of a visuo-spatial processing task by employing simultaneous PET/MR neuroimaging before and after a 4-week learning period. We combined functional PET with metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM) to infer directional interactions across brain regions and subsequently performed simulations to disentangle the role of functional network dynamics and glucose metabolism. As a result, learning altered the top-down regulation of the salience network onto the occipital cortex, with increases in MCM at resting-state and decreases during task execution. Accordingly, a higher divergence between resting-state and task-specific effects was associated with better cognitive performance, indicating that these adaptations are complementary and both required for successful skill learning. Simulations further showed that changes at resting-state were dependent on glucose metabolism, whereas those during task performance were driven by functional connectivity between salience and visual networks. Referring to previous work, we suggest that learning establishes a metabolically expensive skill engram at rest, whose retrieval serves for efficient task execution by minimizing prediction errors between neuronal representations of brain regions on different hierarchical levels.",

We combined mutagenesis, patch-clamp technique, confocal patch-clamp fluorometry, and molecular dynamics simulations to show that residue K464 of the C-linker is essential for stabilizing the closed state of the mHCN2 channel by forming interactions with the opposite subunit. MD simulations revealed that both cAMP and K464E induce a rotation of the intracellular domain relative to the channel pore, weakening the autoinhibitory effect of the unoccupied CL-CNBD region.

Altered GABAergic signaling is hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Nevertheless, how aberrant cellular and molecular mechanisms affect GABAARs in these diseases remain elusive. Recently, we identified Shisa7 as a GABAAR auxiliary subunit that modulates GABAAR trafficking, kinetics, and pharmacology, and discovered a phosphorylation site in Shisa7 (S405) critical for extrasynaptic 5-GABAAR trafficking and tonic inhibition. However, the role of S405 phosphorylation in the regulation of synaptic inhibition, plasticity, and behavior remains unknown. Here, we found that expression of a phospho-null mutant (Shisa7 S405A) in heterologous cells and neurons diminishes 2-GABAAR trafficking. Subsequently, we generate a Shisa7 S405A knock-in (KI) mouse line that displays reduced surface expression of GABAARs in hippocampal neurons. Importantly, both synaptic and tonic inhibition are decreased in KI mice. Moreover, chemically induced inhibitory long-term potentiation is impaired, highlighting a critical role of Shisa7 S405 in GABAergic plasticity. Lastly, KI mice exhibit enhanced locomotor activity and grooming associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Collectively, our study reveals a phosphorylation site critical for Shisa7-dependent trafficking of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs which contributes to behavioral endophenotypes displayed in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Here, we synthesize genetic, phylogenetic and cognitive analyses to understand how the macroscale organization of structure-function coupling across the cortex can inform its role in cognition. In humans, structure-function coupling was highest in regions of unimodal cortex and lowest in transmodal cortex, a pattern that was mirrored by a reduced alignment with heritable connectivity profiles. Structure-function uncoupling in non-human primates had a similar spatial distribution, but we observed an increased coupling between structure and function in association regions in macaques relative to humans. Meta-analysis suggested regions with the least genetic control (low heritable correspondence and different across primates) are linked to social cognition and autobiographical memory. Our findings establish the genetic and evolutionary uncoupling of structure and function in different transmodal systems may support the emergence of complex, culturally embedded forms of cognition.",

For example, more plant species imply more diverse leaf chemistry and thus more kinds of food for herbivores. Here we argue that the evolution of functional trait variance challenges this view. We show that trait-based eco-evolutionary processes force species to evolve narrower trait breadths in tightly packed communities, in their effort to avoid competition with neighboring species. This effect is so strong as to reduce overall trait space coverage, overhauling the expected positive relationship between species- and functional diversity. Empirical data from GalÃ¡pagos land snail communities proved consistent with this claim. As a consequence, trait data from species-poor communities may misjudge functional diversity in species-rich ones, and vice versa.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

However, limited information on the skeletal complications of COVID-19 is known, even though inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract have been known to perturb bone metabolism and cause pathological bone loss. In this study, we characterized the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on bone metabolism in an established golden Syrian hamster model for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 causes significant multifocal loss of bone trabeculae in the long bones and lumbar vertebrae of all infected hamsters. The bone loss progressively worsens from the acute phase to the post-recovery phase. Mechanistically, the bone loss was associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine dysregulation which upregulates osteoclastic differentiation of monocyte-macrophage lineage. The pro-inflammatory cytokines further trigger a second wave of cytokine storm in the skeletal tissues to augment their pro-osteoclastogenesis effect. Our findings in this established hamster model suggest that pathological bone loss may be a neglected complication which warrants more extensive investigations during the long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The benefits of potential prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against pathological bone loss should be further evaluated.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/463665v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (81K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ada9b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1617fcaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cdcd3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75a0ab_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Graphical abstractSARS-CoV-2 infection causes pathological bone loss in golden Syrian hamsters through induction of cytokine storm and inflammation-induced osteoclastogenesis.",

Representing diverse cultural contexts, the new genetic data originates from ancient proto-Ob-Ugric people from Western Siberia (6th-13th century), the pre-Conquest period, and subsisting Hungarians from the Volga-Ural region (6th-14th century) and their neighbours. By examining the eastern archaeology traits of Hungarian prehistory, we also study their genetic composition and origin in an interdisciplinary framework.\n\nWe analysed 110 deep-sequenced mitogenomes and 42 Y-chromosome haplotypes from 18 archaeological sites in Russia. The results support the studied groups genetic relationships regardless of geographical distances, suggesting large-scale mobility. We detected long-lasting genetic connections between the sites representing the Kushnarenkovo and Chiyalik cultures and the Carpathian Basin Hungarians and confirmed the Uralic transmission of several East-Eurasian uniparental lineages in their genepool. Based on phylogenetics, we demonstrate and model the connections and splits of the studied Volga-Ural and conqueror groups.\n\nEarly Hungarians and their alliances conquered the Carpathian Basin around 890 AD. Re-analysis of the Hungarian conquerors maternal genepool reveals numerous surviving maternal relationships in both sexes; therefore, we conclude that men and women came to the Carpathian Basin together, and although they were subsequently genetically fused into the local population, certain eastern lineages survived for centuries.",

Photopigments, an opsin apoprotein bound to a light-absorbing chromophore, present an opportunity to directly relate the amino acid sequence to an absorbance peak phenotype ({lambda}max). We examined this relationship by conducting a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments of retinochrome, a non-visual opsin, from two closely related species: the common bay scallop, Argopecten irradians, and the king scallop, Pecten maximus. Using protein folding models, we identified three amino acid sites of likely functional importance and expressed mutated retinochrome proteins in vitro. Our results show that the mutation of amino acids lining the opsin binding pocket are responsible for fine spectral tuning, or small changes in the {lambda}max of these light sensitive proteins Most mutations caused a blue shift regardless of the retinochrome background, with shifts ranging from a 12 nm blue shift to a 5 nm red shift from the wild-type {lambda}max. These mutations do not show an additive effect, but rather suggests the presence of epistatic interactions. This work highlights the importance of binding pocket shape in the evolution of spectral tuning and builds on our ability to relate genotypic changes to phenotypes in an emerging model for opsin functional analysis.\n\nAuthor summarySite-directed mutagenesis determined that spectral tuning in retinochrome is not solely additive, but is influenced by intra-molecular epistasis.",

Here, we study such patterns in a fungus Schizophyllum commune, the most polymorphic species known3. Throughout the genome, short-range linkage disequilibrium caused by attraction of rare alleles is higher between pairs of nonsynonymous than of synonymous sites. This effect is especially pronounced for pairs of sites that are located within the same gene, especially if a large fraction of the gene is covered by haploblocks, genome segments where the gene pool consists of two highly divergent haplotypes, which is a signature of balancing selection. Haploblocks are usually shorter than 1000 nucleotides, and collectively cover about 10% of the S. commune genome. LD tends to be substantially higher for pairs of nonsynonymous sites encoding amino acids that interact within the protein. There is a substantial correlation between LDs at the same pairs of nonsynonymous sites in the USA and the Russian populations. These patterns indicate that selection in S. commune involves positive epistasis due to compensatory interactions between nonsynonymous alleles. When less polymorphic species are studied, analogous patterns can be detected only through interspecific comparisons.",

A1 is activated by tensile force on VWF concatemers imparted by hydrodynamic drag force. The A1 core is protected from force-induced unfolding by a long-range disulfide that links cysteines near its N and C-termini. The O-glycosylated linkers between A1 and its neighboring domains, which transmit tensile force to A1, are reported to regulate A1 activation for binding to GPIb, but the mechanism is controversial and incompletely defined. Here, we study how these linkers, and their polypeptide and O-glycan moieties, regulate A1 affinity by measuring affinity, kinetics, thermodynamics, hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX), and unfolding by temperature and urea. The N-linker lowers A1 affinity 40-fold with a stronger contribution from its O-glycan than polypeptide moiety. The N-linker also decreases HDX in specific regions of A1 and increases thermal stability and the energy gap between its native state and an intermediate state, which is observed in urea-induced unfolding. The C-linker also decreases affinity of A1 for GPIb, but in contrast to the N-linker, has no significant effect on HDX or A1 stability. Among different models for A1 activation, our data are consistent with the model that the intermediate state has high affinity for GPIb, which is induced by tensile force physiologically and regulated allosterically by the N-linker.\n\nImpact StatementBoth the polypeptide and attached O-glycans N-terminal to the A1 domain in von Willebrand factor lower its affinity for its ligand GPIb on platelets, its stability, and structural dynamics and decrease population of a high-affinity, intermediate state in unfolding.\n\nKey pointsO_LILigand-binding affinity of A1 and the stability of its native state is regulated by an N-terminal interdomain, O-glycosylated linker\nC_LI",

However, the sub-cellular localization and dynamics of MDGAs, as well as their specific mode of action in neurons are still unclear. Here, using both surface immunostaining of endogenous MDGAs and single molecule tracking of recombinant MDGAs in dissociated hippocampal neurons, we show that MDGA1 and MDGA2 molecules are homogeneously distributed and exhibit fast membrane diffusion, with a small reduction in mobility across neuronal maturation in culture Using shRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 strategies to knock-down/out MDGA1 or MDGA2, we demonstrate an increase in the density of excitatory synapses accompanied by enhanced membrane immobilization and an increase in the phosphotyrosine level of neuroligins associated with excitatory post-synaptic differentiation. Finally, we show that decreasing MDGA expression level reduces the mobility of AMPA receptors and increases the frequency of AMPA receptor mediated mEPSCs. Overall, our results support a mechanism by which interactions between MDGAs and neuroligin-1 delays the assembly of functional excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Gene co-expression networks can be used to determine gene regulation and attribute gene function to biological processes. Different high throughput technologies, including one and two-channel microarrays and RNA-sequencing, allow evaluating thousands of gene expression data simultaneously, but these methodologies provide results that cannot be directly compared. Thus, it is complex to analyze coexpression relations between genes, especially when there are missing values arising for experimental reasons. Networks are a helpful tool for studying gene co-expression, where nodes represent genes and edges represent co-expression of pairs of genes. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing a gene co-expression network for the Anopheles gambiae transcriptome from 257 unique studies obtained with different methodologies and experimental designs. We introduce the sliding threshold approach to select node pairs with high Pearson correlation coefficients. The robustness of the method was verified by comparing edge weight distributions under random removal of conditions. The properties of the constructed network are studied in this paper, including node degree distribution, coreness, and community structure. The network core is largely comprised of genes that encode components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the ribosome, while different communities are enriched for genes involved in distinct biological processes. This suggests that the overall network structure is driven to maximize the integration of essential cellular functions, possibly allowing the flexibility to add novel functions.",

Here, we investigated infectivity under various conditions, infection cycles, and genetic diversity of Antarctic sea ice bacteriophages: PANV1, PANV2, OANV1, and OANV2. The phages infect common sea ice bacteria belonging to the genera Paraglaciecola or Octadecabacter. Although the phages are marine and cold-active, replicating at 0-5 {degrees}C, they all survived temporal incubations at [&ge;]30 {degrees}C and remained infectious without any salts or supplemented only with magnesium, suggesting a robust virion assembly maintaining integrity under a wide range of conditions. Host recognition in the cold proved to be effective, and the release of progeny viruses occurred as a result of cell lysis. The analysis of viral genome sequences showed that nearly half of the gene products of each virus are unique, highlighting that sea ice harbors unexplored virus diversity. Based on predicted genes typical for tailed double-stranded DNA phages, we suggest placing the four studied viruses in the class Caudoviricetes. Searching against viral sequences from metagenomic assemblies revealed that related viruses are not restricted to Antarctica, but also found in distant marine environments.\n\nImportanceVery little is known about sea ice microbes despite the significant role of sea ice in the global oceans as well as microbial input into biogeochemical cycling. Studies on the sea ice viruses have been typically limited to -omics-based approaches and microscopic examinations of sea ice samples. Up to date, only four cultivable viruses have been isolated from Antarctic sea ice. Our study of these unique isolates advances the understanding of the genetic diversity of viruses in sea ice environments, their interactions with host microbes, and possible links to other biomes. Such information contributes to more accurate future sea ice biogeochemical models.",

SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or interest (VOC/VOI) have evidence of increased viral transmission, disease severity, or decreased effectiveness of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Remdesivir (RDV, VEKLURY(R)) is a nucleoside analog prodrug and the first FDA-approved antiviral treatment of COVID-19. Here we present a comprehensive antiviral activity assessment of RDV and its parent nucleoside, GS-441524, against 10 current and former SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI clinical isolates by nucleoprotein ELISA and plaque reduction assay.\n\nDelta and Omicron variants remained susceptible to RDV and GS-441524, with EC50 values 0.31 to 0.62-fold of those observed against the ancestral WA1 isolate. All other tested variants exhibited EC50 values ranging from 0.15 to 2.3-fold of the observed EC50 values against WA1. Analysis of nearly 6 million publicly available variant isolate sequences confirmed that Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) target of RDV and GS-441524, is highly conserved across variants with only 2 prevalent changes (P323L and G671S). Using recombinant viruses, both RDV and GS-441524 retained potency against all viruses containing frequent variant substitutions or their combination. Taken together, these results highlight the conserved nature of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 and provide evidence of sustained SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of RDV and GS-441524 across the tested variants. The observed pan-variant activity of RDV supports its continued use for the treatment of COVID-19 regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.",

Their mode of action is thought to be mediated through their impact on host microbial communities and the associated metabolism. Bio-Mos is a commercially available pre-biotic currently used in the agri-feed industry. To assess Bio-Mos for potential use as a prebiotic growth promotor in salmonid aquaculture, we have modified an established Atlantic salmon in vitro gut model, SalmoSim, to evaluate its impact on the host microbial communities. Inoculated from biological triplicates of adult farmed salmon pyloric caeca compartments, the microbial communities were stabilised in SalmoSim followed by a twenty-day exposure to the prebiotic and in turn followed by an eight day  wash out period. Dietary inclusion of MOS resulted in a significant increase in formate (p=0.001), propionate (p=0.037) and isovalerate (p=0.024) levels, correlated with increased abundances of several, principally, anaerobic microbial genera (Fusobacterium, Agarivorans, Pseudoalteromonas). DNA metabarcoding with the 16S rDNA marker confirmed a significant shift in microbial community composition in response to MOS supplementation with observed increase in lactic acid producing Carnobacterium. In conjunction with previous in vivo studies linking enhanced volatile fatty acid production alongside MOS supplementation to host growth and performance, our data suggests that Bio-Mos may be of value in salmonid production.

    "preprint_abstract": "Forces produced by motor proteins and microtubule dynamics within the mitotic spindle are crucial for proper chromosome segregation. In addition to linear forces, rotational forces or torques are present in the spindle, reflected in the left-handed twisted shapes of microtubule bundles that make the spindle chiral. However, the biological role and molecular origins of spindle chirality are unknown. By developing methods for measuring spindle twist, we show that spindles are most chiral near the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. To assess the role of chirality in maintaining spindle robustness under force, we compressed the spindles along their axis. This resulted in stronger left-handed twist, suggesting that the twisted shape allows for a mechanical response to forces. Inhibition or depletion of motor proteins that perform chiral stepping, Eg5/kinesin-5, Kif18A/kinesin-8, MKLP1/kinesin-6, and dynein, decreased the left-handed twist or led to right-handed twist, implying that these motors regulate the twist by rotating microtubules within their antiparallel overlaps or at the spindle pole. Right-handed twist was also observed after the depletion of the microtubule nucleator augmin, indicating its contribution to the twist through the nucleation of antiparallel bridging microtubules. The uncovered switch from left-handed to right-handed twist reveals the existence of competing mechanisms that promote twisting in opposite directions. As round spindles were more twisted than elongated ones, we infer that bending and twisting moments are generated by similar molecular mechanisms and propose a physiological role for spindle chirality in allowing the spindle to absorb mechanical load.",

However, recent studies conclude that also the physico-chemical properties of the AD can control TF assembly at chromatin by driving a phase separation into transcriptional condensates. Here, we dissected transcription activation by comparing different synthetic TFs at a reporter gene array with real-time single-cell fluorescence microscopy readouts. In these experiments, binding site occupancy, residence time and co-activator recruitment in relation to multivalent TF interactions were compared. While phase separation propensity and activation strength of the AD were correlated, the actual formation of liquid-like TF droplets had a neutral or inhibitory effect on transcription activation. Rather, we conclude that multivalent AD mediated interactions increase the transcription activation capacity of a TF by stabilizing chromatin binding and mediating the recruitment of co-activators independent of phase separation.",

Especially the introduction of new species, like Gammarus tigrinus, into the Baltic Sea led to yet not understood changes in the food web. Furthermore, future projections point to increased water temperatures at lowered salinity levels affecting species capacity to acclimatize to changing abiotic factors. In this study we investigated the influence of temperature and salinity on the grazing pressure of Gammarus tigrinus on two charophyte species: Chara aspera and Chara tomentosa. The grazing experiments were conducted in a full factorial design with the factors salinity (3 - 13 g kg-1), temperature (5 - 30 {degrees}C), and charophyte species. Grazing rates were determined as mass deviation within 48 hours considering biomass changes in the presence and absence of gammarids. Grazing rate were further used to calculate charophyte losses in two coastal lagoons with different salinity concentrations for recent and future time periods. The potential grazing peak of about 24 {degrees}C is not yet reached in these coastal waters but may be reached in the near future as shown by our future projection results. However, the temperature increase, and desalination will cause a shift in seasonal individual grazing patterns from summer to spring and autumn. Desalination and temperature increase can lead to a shift in optimal habitats for G. tigrinus in the future.",

However, the analysis of ribonucleoside modifications is impeded due to the hydrophilicity of the ribonucleoside molecules. In this research, we used solid-phase permethylation to derivatize the ribonucleosides, and the permethylated ribonucleosides, which were then quantitively analyzed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method. The solid-phase permethylation efficiently derivatized the ribonucleosides, and more than 60 RNA modifications were simultaneously monitored using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS) performed in the dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) mode. Because of the increased hydrophobicity of permethylated ribonucleosides, this method enhanced retention, separation, and ionization efficiency, resulting in improved detection and quantification when compared to existing analytical strategies of RNA modifications. We applied this new approach to measure the extent of cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation in RNA obtained from mouse embryonic stem cells with genetic deficiencies in ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. The results matched previously performed analyses and highlighted the sensitivity, efficacy, and robustness of the new method.

A fundamental challenge faced by both viruses and their hosts is the ability to achieve the correct folding and assembly of their proteome while avoiding misfolding and aggregation. In cells, this process is facilitated by numerous chaperone systems together with a large number of co-chaperones. In this work, we set out to define the chaperones and co-chaperones involved in the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Using an RNAi screen, we identify multiple members of cellular protein folding networks whose knockdown alters RSV replication. The reduced number of chaperones and co-chaperones identified in this work can facilitate the unmasking of specific chaperone subnetworks required for distinct steps of the RSV life cycle and identifies new potential targets for antiviral therapy. Indeed, we show that the pharmacological inhibition of one of the genes identified in the RNAi screen, valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), can impede the replication of RSV by interfering with the infection cycle at multiple steps.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics allows large-scale generation of phosphorylation site data. However, analytical pipelines need to be carefully designed and optimised to minimise incorrect identification of phosphopeptide sequences or wrong localisation of phosphorylation sites within those peptides. Public databases such as PhosphoSitePlus (PSP) and PeptideAtlas (PA) compile results from published papers or openly available MS data, but to our knowledge, there is no database-level control for false discovery of sites, subsequently leading to the likely overestimation of true phosphosites. It is therefore difficult for researchers to assess which phosphosites are \"real\" and which are likely to be artefacts of data processing. By profiling the human phosphoproteome, we aimed to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of phosphosites based on available evidence in PSP and/or PA and predict a more realistic count of true phosphosites. We ranked sites into phosphorylation likelihood sets based on layers of accumulated evidence and then analysed them in terms of amino acid conservation across 100 species, sequence properties and functional annotations of associated proteins. We demonstrated significant differences between the sets and developed a method for independent phosphosite FDR estimation. Remarkably, we estimated a false discovery rate of 86.1%, 95.4% and 82.2% within sets of described phosphoserine (pSer), phosphothreonine (pThr) and phosphotyrosine (pTyr) sites respectively for which only a single piece of identification evidence is available (the vast majority of sites in PSP). Overall, we estimate that [~]56,000 Ser, 10,000 Thr and 12,000 Tyr phosphosites in the human proteome have truly been identified to date, based on evidence in PSP and/or PA, which is lower than most published estimates. Furthermore, our analysis estimated [~]91,000 Ser, 49,000 Thr and 26,000 Tyr sites that are likely to represent false-positive phosphosite identifications. We conclude that researchers should be aware of the significant potential for false positive sites to be present in public databases and should evaluate the evidence behind the phosphosites used in their research.",

In the largest order of insects, Coleoptera, it remains unknown whether OR orthologues have conserved or divergent functions in different species. Using HEK293 cells, we addressed this question through functional characterization of two groups of OR orthologues in three species of the Curculionidae (weevil) family, the conifer-feeding bark beetles Ips typographus L.

Results show highly conserved response specificities, with one group of orthologues (HabiOR3/DponOR8/ItypOR6) responding exclusively to 2-phenylethanol (2-PE), and the other group (HabiOR4/DponOR9/ItypOR5) responding to angiosperm green leaf volatiles (GLVs). Both groups of orthologues belong to the coleopteran OR subfamily 2B, and share a common ancestor with OR5 in the cerambycid Megacyllene caryae, also tuned to 2-PE, suggesting a shared evolutionary history of 2-PE receptors across two beetle superfamilies. The detected compounds are ecologically relevant for conifer-feeding curculionids, and are probably linked to fitness, with GLVs being used to avoid angiosperm non-host plants, and 2-PE being important for intraspecific communication and/or playing a putative role in beetle-microbe symbioses. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal evolutionary conservation of OR functions across several beetle species and hence sheds new light on the functional evolution of insect ORs.",

Developing hardware-accelerated MC simulation algorithms that can accurately model polarized light inside 3-D heterogeneous tissues can greatly expand the utility of polarization in biophotonics applications.\n\nApproachHere we report a highly efficient polarized MC algorithm capable of modeling arbitrarily complex media defined over a voxelated domain. Each voxel of the domain can be associated with spherical scatters of various radii and densities. The Stokes vector of each simulated photon packet is updated through photon propagation, creating spatially resolved polarization measurements over the detectors or domain surface.\n\nResultsWe have implemented this algorithm in our widely disseminated MC simulator, Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX). It is validated by comparing with a reference CPU-based simulator in both homogeneous and layered domains, showing excellent agreement and a 931-fold speedup.\n\nConclusionThe polarization-enabled MCX (pMCX) offers biophotonics community an efficient tool to explore polarized light in bio-tissues, and is freely available at http://mcx.space/.",

For example, we recently identified in Hormaphis cornu a family of rapidly evolving bicycle genes, which encode novel proteins implicated as plant gall effectors. Sequence similarity search methods yielded few putative bicycle homologs in other species. Coding sequence-independent features of genes, such as intron-exon boundaries, often evolve more slowly than coding sequences, however, and can provide complementary evidence for homology. We found that a linear logistic regression classifier using only structural features of bicycle genes identified many putative bicycle homologs in other species. Independent evidence from sequence features and intron locations supported homology assignments. To test the potential roles of bicycle genes in other aphids, we sequenced the genome of a second gall- forming aphid, Tetraneura ulmi, and found that many bicycle genes are strongly expressed in the salivary glands of the gall forming foundress. In addition, bicycle genes are strongly overexpressed in the salivary glands of a non-gall forming aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and in the non-gall forming generations of Hormaphis cornu. These observations suggest that Bicycle proteins may be used by multiple aphid species to manipulate plants in diverse ways. Incorporation of gene structural features into sequence search algorithms may aid identification of deeply divergent homologs, especially of rapidly evolving genes involved in host-parasite interactions.",

We recently conducted a first of its kind study to investigate EEEV clinical disease course following aerosol challenge in a cynomolgus macaque model utilizing the state of the art telemetry to measure critical physiological parameters. Following challenge, all parameters were rapidly and profoundly altered, and all nonhuman primates (NHPs) met the euthanasia criteria. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive pathology investigation of tissues collected at euthanasia to gain insights into EEEV pathogenesis. Viral RNA and proteins as well as microscopic lesions were absent in the visceral organs. In contrast, viral RNA and proteins were readily detected throughout the brain including autonomic nervous system (ANS) control centers and spinal cord. However, despite presence of viral RNA and proteins, majority of the brain and spinal cord tissues exhibited minimal or no microscopic lesions. The virus tropism was restricted primarily to neurons, and virus particles (~61-68 nm) were present within axons of neurons and throughout the extracellular spaces. However, active virus replication was absent or minimal in majority of the brain and was limited to regions proximal to the olfactory tract. These data suggest that EEEV initially replicates in/near the olfactory bulb following aerosol challenge and is rapidly transported to distal regions of the brain by exploiting the neuronal axonal transport system to facilitate neuron-to-neuron spread. Once within the brain, the virus gains access to the ANS control centers likely leading to disruption and/or dysregulation of critical physiological parameters to produce severe disease. Moreover, the absence of microscopic lesions strongly suggests that the underlying mechanism of EEEV pathogenesis is due to neuronal dysfunction rather than neuronal death. This study is the first comprehensive investigation of EEEV clinical disease course and pathogenesis in a NHP model and will provide significant insights into the evaluation of countermeasure.\n\nAuthor SummaryEEEV is an arbovirus endemic in parts of North America and is able to produce fatal encephalitis in humans and domesticated animals. Despite multiple human outbreaks during the last 80 years, there are still no therapeutic or vaccines to treat or prevent human disease. One critical obstacle in the development of effective countermeasure is the lack of insights into EEEV pathogenesis in a susceptible animal host. We recently conducted a study in cynomolgus macaques to investigate the disease course by measuring clinical parameters relevant to humans. Following infection, these parameters were rapidly and profoundly altered leading to severe disease. In this study, we examined the potential mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis to cause severe disease. The virus was present in many parts of the brain and spinal cord, however, little or no pathological lesions as well as active virus replication were observed. Additionally, neurons were the predominant target of EEEV and virus transport was facilitated by axonal transport system to spread neuron-to-neuron throughout the brain and spinal cord. These data show that EEEV likely hijacks host cell transport system to rapidly spread in the brain and local/global neuronal dysfunction rather than death is the principal cause of severe disease.",

Through screening a library of human interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), we identified TRIM25 as a potent inhibitor of EBOV transcription-and-replication-competent virus-like particle (trVLP) propagation. TRIM25 overexpression inhibited the accumulation of viral genomic and messenger RNAs independently of the RNA sensor RIG-I or secondary proinflammatory gene expression. Deletion of TRIM25 strongly attenuated the sensitivity of trVLPs to inhibition by type-I interferon. The antiviral activity of TRIM25 required ZAP and the effect of type-I interferon was modulated by the CpG dinucleotide content of the viral genome. We find that TRIM25 interacts with the EBOV vRNP, resulting in its autoubiquitination and ubiquitination of the viral nucleoprotein (NP). TRIM25 is recruited to incoming vRNPs shortly after cell entry, and leads to dissociation of NP from the vRNA.

Tetrad analysis is a powerful approach to quantify the genetic makeups and recombination landscapes of meiotic products. Here we present RecombineX (https://github.com/yjx1217/RecombineX), a generalized computational framework that automates the full workflow of marker identification, gamete genotyping, and tetrad-based recombination profiling based on any organisms and genetic backgrounds with batch processing capability. Aside from conventional reference-based analysis, RecombineX can also perform analysis based on parental genome assemblies, which enables analyzing meiotic recombination landscapes in their native genomic contexts. Additional features such as copy number variation profiling and missing genotype inference further enhance downstream analysis. RecombineX also includes a dedicate module for simulating the genomes and reads of recombinant tetrads, which enables fine-tuned simulation-based hypothesis testing. This simulation module revealed the power and accuracy of RecombineX even when analyzing tetrads with very low sequencing depths (e.g., 1-2X). Tetrad sequencing data from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were further used to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of RecombineX for organisms with both small and large genomes, manifesting RecombineX as an all-around one stop solution for future tetrad analysis.\n\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis is a fundamental cellular process that ensures faithful chromosome segregation and promotes allele shuffling. Tetrad analysis, which isolates and genotypes all four meiotic products (i.e., tetrad) derived from a single meiosis, remains the most straightforward and powerful way of studying meiotic recombination and its modulators at fine scales. The wide application of tetrad analysis in yeasts, filamentous fungi, green algae, and land plants have substantially expand our understanding of meiotic recombination in terms of both genome-wide landscapes and molecular mechanisms. Here we described the first generalized computational framework named RecombineX that automates the full workflow of tetrad analysis based on any organisms and genetic backgrounds. In addition, aside from conventional reference-based analysis, RecombineX can also perform analysis based on parental genome assemblies, which enables analyzing meiotic recombination landscapes in their native genomic contexts. Using both simulated and real tetradsequencing data, we further demonstrated RecombineXs trustable performance, versatile usage, and batch-processing capability, manifesting RecombineX as an all-around one stop solution for tetrad analysis. Especially considering that meiotic gamete genome sequencing from different natural and mutant backgrounds can now be acquired, we expect RecombineX to become a popular tool that empowers future tetrad analysis across different genetic backgrounds and species.",

The observational character of prospective cohort data and the intricate characteristics of microbiome data make it, however, challenging to discover causal associations between environment and microbiome. Here, we introduce a causal inference framework based on the Rubin Causal Model that can help scientists to investigate such environment-host microbiome relationships, to capitalize on existing, possibly powerful, test statistics, and test plausible sharp null hypotheses. Using data from the German KORA cohort study, we illustrate our framework by designing two hypothetical randomized experiments with interventions of (i) air pollution reduction and (ii) smoking prevention. We study the effects of these interventions on the human gut microbiome by testing shifts in microbial diversity, changes in individual microbial abundances, and microbial network wiring between groups of matched subjects via randomization-based inference. In the smoking prevention scenario, we identify a small interconnected group of taxa worth further scrutiny, including Christensenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae genera, that have been previously associated with blood metabolite changes. These findings demonstrate that our framework may uncover potentially causal links between environmental exposure and the gut microbiome from observational data. We anticipate the present statistical framework to be a good starting point for further discoveries on the role of the gut microbiome in environmental health.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Chemical synapses exhibit a diverse array of internal mechanisms that affect the dynamics of transmission efficacy. Many of these processes, such as release of neurotransmitter and vesicle recycling, depend strongly on activity-dependent influx and accumulation of Ca2+. To model how each of these processes may affect the processing of information in neural circuits, and how their dysfunction may lead to disease states, requires a computationally efficient modelling framework, capable of generating accurate phenomenology without incurring a heavy computational cost per synapse. Constructing a phenomenologically realistic model requires the precise characterization of the timing and probability of neurotransmitter release. Difficulties arise in that functional forms of instantaneous release rate can be difficult to extract from noisy data without running many thousands of trials, and in biophysical synapses, facilitation of per-vesicle release probability is confounded by depletion. To overcome this, we obtained traces of free Ca2+ concentration in response to various action potential stimulus trains from a molecular MCell model of a hippocampal mossy fiber axon. Ca2+ sensors were placed at varying distance from a voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) cluster, and Ca2+ was buffered by calbindin. Then, using the calcium traces to drive deterministic state vector models of synaptotagmin 1 and 7 (Syt-1/7), which respectively mediate synchronous and asynchronous release in excitatory hippocampal synapses, we obtained high-resolution profiles of instantaneous release rate, to which we applied functional fits. Synchronous vesicle release occurred predominantly within half a micron of the source of spike-evoked Ca2+ influx, while asynchronous release occurred more consistently at all distances. Both fast and slow mechanisms exhibited multi-exponential release rate curves, whose magnitudes decayed exponentially with distance from the Ca2+ source. Profile parameters facilitate on different time scales according to a single, general facilitation function. These functional descriptions lay the groundwork for efficient mesoscale modelling of vesicular release dynamics.\n\nAuthor SummaryMost information transmission between neurons in the brain occurs via release of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles. In response to a presynaptic spike, calcium influx at the active zone of a synapse can trigger the release of neurotransmitter with a certain probability. These stochastic release events may occur immediately after a spike or with some delay. As calcium accumulates from one spike to the next, the probability of release may increase (facilitate) for subsequent spikes. This process, known as short-term plasticity, transforms the spiking code to a release code, underlying much of the brains information processing. In this paper, we use an accurate, detailed model of presynaptic molecular physiology to characterize these processes at high precision in response to various spike trains. We then apply model reduction to the results to obtain a phenomenological model of release timing, probability, and facilitation, which can perform as accurately as the molecular model but with far less computational cost. This mesoscale model of spike-evoked release and facilitation helps to bridge the gap between microscale molecular dynamics and macroscale information processing in neural circuits. It can thus benefit large scale modelling of neural circuits, biologically inspired machine learning models, and the design of neuromorphic chips.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Phase separation of biomolecules could be mediated by both specific and non-specific interactions. How the interplay between non-specific and specific interactions along with polymer entropy influences phase separation is an open question. We address this question by simulating self-associating molecules as polymer chains with a short core stretch that forms the specifically interacting functional interface, and longer non-core regions that participate in non-specific/promiscuous interactions. Our results show that the interplay of specific (strength,{epsilon} sp) and non-specific interactions (strength,{epsilon} ns) could result in phase separation of polymers and its transition to solid-like aggregates (mature state). In the absence of{epsilon} ns, the polymer chains do not dwell long enough in the vicinity of each other to undergo phase separation and transition into a mature state. On the other hand, in the limit of strong{epsilon} ns, the assemblies cannot transition into the mature state and form a non-specific assembly, suggesting an optimal range of interactions favoring mature multimers. In the scenario where only a fraction (Nfrac) of the non-core regions participate in attractive interactions, we find that a slight modifications to either{epsilon} ns or Nfrac can result in a dramatically altered self-assembled states. Using a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous mix of polymers, we establish how this interplay between interaction energies dictates the propensity of biomolecules to find the correct binding partner at dilute concentrations in crowded environments.\n\nAuthor SummaryBiological function relies on the ability of biomolecules to bind to specific interaction partners. In the crowded cellular milieu, the process of biomolecules binding to specific interaction partners to carry out a function is non-trivial. A mere diffusion-limited meeting of interaction partners in space does not ensure biomolecular function. Rather, even when in contact these molecules have to find the correct orientations to carry out function. Further, for dynamic biomolecules such as polymers, the functional configuration is often one of several possible configurations. In this scenario, assuming the functional configuration after binding involves overcoming of a significant entropic barrier. Therefore, the interacting biomolecules have to dwell in contact long enough before they reorganize to find the functional orientation! While functional contacts offer an enthalpic gain, they are often only a small fraction of all protein-protein interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we study the role played by non-functional, promiscuous interactions in shaping the thermodynamics and kinetics of formation of specific interactions. Our results suggest that there exists an optimal range of non-specific interaction strengths which promotes the process of biomolecular complexes finding the functional configurations.",

Immune microenvironments with varied survival outcomes could be predicted using a neural network model trained on HLA expression data.

Our results suggest the potential of using HLA expression data to predict patient prognosis. Taken together, we emphasize the crucial role of HLA upregulation in shaping prolonged anti-tumor immunity.\n\nSynopsisIn a retrospective analysis of 11080 patients of 33 TCGA cancer types, we showed HLA class I and class II differential expression shape various immune microenvironments and tumor immunoediting mechanisms, predicting tumor immunogenicity and patient survival.",

Investigating the mouse striatum, here we found that the two most prominent subtypes of striatal interneurons, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic and cholinergic (ChAT+) interneurons, undergo extensive programmed cell death between the first and second postnatal weeks. Remarkably, the survival of PV+ and ChAT+ interneurons is regulated by distinct mechanisms mediated by their specific afferent connectivity. While long-range cortical inputs control PV+ interneuron survival, ChAT+ interneuron survival is regulated by local input from the medium spiny neurons. Our results identify input-specific circuit mechanisms that operate during the period of programmed cell death to establish the final number of interneurons in nascent striatal networks.",

These advantages are well suited for investigating molecular mechanisms in angiosperms, especially C4 crop species. Here, we report a procedure for isolating gametes and zygotes from S. viridis flowers. To isolate egg cells, ovaries were harvested from unpollinated mature flowers and cut transversely, which allowed direct access to the embryo sac. Thereafter, an egg cell was released from the cut end of the basal portion of the dissected ovary. To isolate sperm cells, pollen grains released from anthers were immersed in a mannitol solution, resulting in pollen-grain bursting, which released sperm cells. Additionally, S. viridis zygotes were successfully isolated from freshly pollinated flowers. Isolated zygotes cultured in a liquid medium developed into globular-like embryos and cell masses. Thus, isolated S. viridis gametes, zygotes and embryos are attainable for detailed observations and investigations of fertilization and developmental events in angiosperms.",

Source and time-frequency analyses decomposed EEGs into oscillations (reflecting neural entrainment) stemming from the bilateral auditory cortex.\n\nResultsPhase-locking strength in AMB depended critically on the speed of auditory stimuli. In contrast to age-matched peers, AMB responses were largely insensitive to rate manipulations. This rate resistance was seen regardless of the ear of presentation and in both cortical hemispheres.\n\nConclusionChildren with AMB show a stark inflexibility in auditory cortical entrainment to rapid sounds. In addition to reduced capacity to integrate information between the ears, we identify more rigid tagging of external auditory stimuli. Our neurophysiological findings may account for certain temporal processing deficits commonly observed in AMB and related auditory processing disorders (APDs) behaviorally. More broadly, our findings may inform communication strategies and future rehabilitation programs; increasing the rate of stimuli above a normal (slow) speech rate is likely to make stimulus processing more challenging for individuals with AMB/APD.",

Current methods predominantly focus on matrix factorization and aim at detecting neurons in the imaged field-of-view, and then inferring the corresponding time-traces. The explicit locality constraints on the cell shapes additionally limits the applicability to optical imaging at different scales (i.e., dendritic or widefield data). Here we present a new method that frames the problem of isolating independent fluorescing components as a dictionary learning problem. Specifically, we focus on the time-traces, which are the main quantity used in scientific discovery, and learn the dictionary of time traces with the spatial maps acting as the presence coefficients encoding which pixels the time traces are active in. Furthermore, we present a novel graph filtering model which redefines connectivity between pixels in terms of their shared temporal activity, rather than spatial proximity. This model greatly eases the ability of our method to handle data with complex non-local spatial structure, such as dendritic imaging. We demonstrate important properties of our method, such as robustness to initialization, implicitly inferring number of neurons and simultaneously detecting different neuronal types, on both synthetic data and real data examples. Specifically, we demonstrate applications of our method to calcium imaging both at the dendritic, somatic, and widefield scales.",

Yet, for field-derived data, temperature response modeling bears flaws and pitfalls concerning the interpretation of derived parameters. In this study, climate data from five growing seasons with differing temperature distributions served as starting point for a growth simulation of wheat stem elongation, based on a four-parametric temperature response function (Wang-Engel) including all cardinal temperatures. In a novel approach, we re-extracted dose-responses from the simulation by combining high-resolution (hours) temperature courses with low-resolution (days) height data. The collection of such data is common in field phenotyping platforms. To take advantage of the lack of supra-optimal temperatures during the stem elongation, simpler (linear and asymptotic) models to predict temperature-response parameters were investigated. The asymptotic model extracted the base temperature of growth and the maximum absolute growth rate with high precision, whereas simpler, linear models failed to do so. Additionally, the asymptotic model provided a proxy estimate for the optimum temperature. However, when including seasonally changing cardinal temperatures, the prediction accuracy of the asymptotic model was strongly reduced. In a field study with three winter wheat varieties, significant differences were found for all three asymptotic dose-response curve parameters. We conclude that the asymptotic model based on high-resolution temperature courses is suitable to extract meaningful parameters from field-based data.",

However, the presence and epidemiological relevance of genetic exchange in Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, has been controversial and debated for many years. Field studies have identified both predominantly clonal and sexually recombining natural populations. Two of six natural T. cruzi lineages (TcV and TcVI) show hybrid mosaicism, using analysis of single-gene locus markers. The formation of hybrid strains in vitro has been achieved and this provides a framework to study the mechanisms and adaptive significance of genetic exchange. Using whole genome sequencing of a set of experimental hybrids strains, we have confirmed that hybrid formation initially results in tetraploid parasites. The hybrid progeny showed novel mutations that were not attributable to either (diploid) parent showing an increase in amino acid changes. In long-term culture, up to 800 generations, there was progressive, gradual erosion of progeny genomes towards triploidy, yet retention of elevated copy number was observed at several core housekeeping loci. Our findings indicate hybrid formation by fusion of diploid T. cruzi, followed by sporadic genome erosion, but with substantial potential for adaptive evolution, as has been described as a genetic feature of other organisms, such as some fungi.",

However, the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear. Here, we visualized type IV pilus-dependent cell movement in the rod-shaped thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus using optical microscopy at physiological temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors, SesA, SesB and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Our results suggest that the decision-making process for directional switching in phototaxis involves light-dependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP. Furthermore, we reveal that rod-shaped cells can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be controlled not only by pole-to-pole regulation but also within-a-pole regulation. This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.",

Here, we explored transcriptomes of HSPCs with Shp2 mutations derived from JMML patients and a novel NS zebrafish model.

Single cell mRNA sequencing of HSPCs from Shp2D61G zebrafish embryos and bulk sequencing of HSPCs from JMML patients revealed an overlapping inflammatory gene expression pattern. Strikingly, an anti-inflammatory agent rescued JMML-like MPN in Shp2D61G zebrafish embryos. Our results indicate that a common inflammatory response was triggered in the HSPCs from sporadic JMML patients and syndromic NS zebrafish, which potentiated MPN and may represent a future target for JMML therapies.",

Bacterial cells can adapt to diverse external stresses, such as antibiotic exposure, but can they also adapt to detrimental genetic modification? To address this issue, we visualized the response of individual Escherichia coli cells to deletion of the antibiotic resistance gene under chloramphenicol (Cp) exposure, combining the light-inducible genetic recombination and microfluidic long-term single-cell tracking. We found that a significant fraction ([~] 40%) of resistance-gene-deleted cells demonstrated a gradual restoration of growth and stably proliferated under continuous Cp exposure without additional mutations. Such physiological adaptation to genetic modification was not observed when the deletion was introduced in 10 h or more advance before Cp exposure. Resistance gene deletion under Cp exposure disrupted the stoichiometric balance of ribosomal large and small subunit proteins (RplS and RpsB). However, the balance was gradually recovered in the cell lineages with restored growth. These results demonstrate that bacterial cells can adapt even to lethal genetic modifications by plastically gaining physiological resistance. However, the access to the resistance states is limited by the environmental histories and the timings of genetic modification.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hundreds of cytotoxic natural or synthetic lipidic compounds contain chiral alkynylcarbinol motifs, but the mechanism of action of those potential therapeutic agents remains unknown. Using a genetic screen in haploid human cells, we discovered that the enantiospecific cytotoxicity of numerous terminal alkynylcarbinols, including the highly cytotoxic dialkynylcarbinols, involves a bioactivation by HSD17B11, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) known to oxidize the C-17 carbinol center of androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol to the corresponding ketone. A similar oxidation of dialkynylcarbinols generates dialkynylketones, that we characterize as highly protein-reactive electrophiles. We established that, once bioactivated in cells, the dialkynylcarbinols covalently modify several proteins involved in protein-quality control mechanisms, resulting in their lipoxidation on cysteines and lysines through Michael addition. For some proteins, this triggers their association to cellular membranes and results in endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein response activation, ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibition and cell death by apoptosis. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we show that generic lipidic alkynylcarbinols can be devised to be bioactivated by other SDRs, including human RDH11 and HPGD/15-PGDH. Given that the SDR superfamily is one of the largest and most ubiquitous, this unique cytotoxic mechanism-of-action could be widely exploited to treat diseases, in particular cancer, through the design of tailored prodrugs.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/460423v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12daae1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12db406org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1863517org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b548_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

Our previous work characterized buoyant mass accumulation dynamics in mitosis (Miettinen et al., 2019), but how dry mass and cell composition change in mitosis has remained unclear. To better understand mitotic cell growth and compositional changes, we develop a single-cell approach for monitoring dry mass and the density of that dry mass every [~]75 seconds with 1.3% and 0.3% measurement precision, respectively. We find that suspension grown mammalian cells lose dry mass and increase dry density following mitotic entry. These changes display large, non-genetic cell-to-cell variability, and the changes are reversed at metaphase-anaphase transition, after which dry mass continues accumulating. The change in dry density causes buoyant and dry mass to differ specifically in early mitosis, thus reconciling existing literature on mitotic cell growth. Mechanistically, the dry composition changes do not require mitotic cell swelling or elongation. Instead, cells in early mitosis increase lysosomal exocytosis, and inhibition of exocytosis prevents the dry composition from changing. Overall, our work provides a new approach for monitoring single-cell dry mass and composition and reveals that mitosis is coupled to extensive exocytosis-mediated secretion of cellular contents.",

Here we show, through model analyses and large-scale interactive behavioural experiments with 585 human subjects, that conformist influence can indeed promote favourable risk taking in repeated experience-based decision making, even though many individuals are systematically biased towards adverse risk aversion. Although strong positive feedback conferred by copying the majoritys behaviour could result in unfavourable informational cascades, our differential equation model of collective behavioural dynamics identified a key role for increasing exploration by negative feedback arising when a weak minority influence undermines the inherent behavioural bias. This  collective behavioural rescue, emerging through coordination of positive and negative feedback, highlights a benefit of collective learning in a broader range of environmental conditions than previously assumed and resolves the ostensible paradox of adaptive collective behavioural flexibility under conformist influences.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundAn accurate timescale of evolutionary history is essential to testing hypotheses about the influence of historical events and processes, and the timescale for evolution is increasingly derived from analysis of DNA sequences. But variation in the rate of molecular evolution complicates the inference of time from DNA. Evidence is growing for numerous factors, such as life history and habitat, that are linked both to the molecular processes of mutation and fixation and to rates of macroevolutionary diversification. However, the most widely used methods rely on idealised models of rate variation, such as the uncorrelated and autocorrelated clocks, and molecular dating methods are rarely tested against complex models of rate change. One relationship that is not accounted for in molecular dating is the potential for interaction between molecular substitution rates and speciation, a relationship that has been supported by empirical studies in a growing number of taxa. If these relationships are as widespread as current evidence suggests, they may have a significant influence on molecular dates.\n\nResultsWe simulate phylogenies and molecular sequences under three different realistic rate variation models - one in which speciation rates and substitution rates both vary but are unlinked, one in which they covary continuously and one punctuated model in which molecular change is concentrated in speciation events, using empirical case studies to parameterise realistic simulations. We test three commonly used \"relaxed clock\" molecular dating methods against these realistic simulations to explore the degree of error in molecular dates under each model. We find average divergence time inference errors ranging from 12% of node age for the unlinked model when reconstructed under an uncorrelated rate prior using BEAST 2, to up to 91% when sequences evolved under the punctuated model are reconstructed under an autocorrelated prior using PAML.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate the potential for substantial errors in molecular dates when both speciation rates and substitution rates vary between lineages. This study highlights the need for tests of molecular dating methods against realistic models of rate variation generated from empirical parameters and known relationships.",

While SHH tumors exhibit overall deregulation of this pathway, they also show patient age-specific aberrations.\n\nTo investigate if the developmental stage of the CGNP can account for these age-specific lesions, we analyzed developing murine CGNP transcriptomes and observed highly dynamic gene expression as function of age. Cross-species comparison with human SHH medulloblastoma showed partial maintenance of these expression patterns, and highlighted low primary cilium expression as hallmark of infant medulloblastoma and early embryonic CGNPs. This coincided with reduced responsiveness to upstream Shh pathway component Smoothened, while sensitivity to downstream components Sufu and Gli was retained.\n\nTogether, these findings can explain the preference for SUFU mutations in infant medulloblastoma and suggest that drugs targeting the downstream SHH pathway will be most appropriate for infant patients.",

Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) is a particularly debilitating complication that renders the brain further vulnerable to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, albeit these molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we have used an orthopedic model of tibial fracture/fixation in APPSwDI/mNos2-/- AD (CVN-AD) mice to investigate relevant pathogenetic mechanisms underlying DSD. We conducted the present study in 6 months-old CVN-AD mice, an age at which we speculated amyloid-{beta} pathology had not saturated BBB and neuroimmune functioning. We found that URMC-099, our brain-penetrant anti-inflammatory neuroprotective drug, prevented inflammatory endothelial activation, breakdown of the BBB, synapse loss, and microglial activation in our DSD model. Taken together, our data link post-surgical endothelial activation, microglial MafB immunoreactivity, and synapse loss as key substrates for DSD, all of which can be prevented by URMC-099.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bone metastasis is a frequent complication of breast cancer, occurring in about 50-70% of breast cancer patients with late-stage disease. The lack of effective therapy suggests that the precise molecular mechanisms underlying bone metastasis are still unclear. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is considered a breast cancer oncogene and its expression is correlated with metastasis of breast cancer, but its function in bone metastasis has not been well explored. Herein we report that EZH2 promotes osteolytic metastasis of breast cancer through regulating transforming growth factor beta (TGF{beta}) signaling, a key pathway in bone metastasis. Knocking down EZH2 decreases bone metastasis incidence and outgrowth in vivo. EZH2 induces cancer cell proliferation and osteoclast maturation, when breast cancer cells are co-cultured with osteoblasts and osteoclasts together in vitro. Mechanistically, EZH2 increases transcription of ITGB1, which encodes for integrin {beta}1. Integrin {beta}1 activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which phosphorylates TGF{beta} receptor type I (TGF{beta}RI) at tyrosine 182, thus enhances the binding of TGF{beta}RI to TGF{beta} receptor type II (TGF{beta}RII), therefore activates Smad2 and increases parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) expression. Clinically applicable FAK inhibitors but not EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitor effectively inhibits breast cancer bone metastasis in vivo. Overall, our data signify integrin {beta}1-FAK as a new downstream effector of EZH2 in breast cancer cells, and EZH2-integrin {beta}1-FAK axis cooperates with TGF{beta} signaling pathway to promote bone metastasis of breast cancer.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Facing the abundance and diversity of phages, bacteria have developed multiple anti-phage mechanisms. In the past three years, the number of known anti-phage mechanisms has been expanded by at least 5-fold rendering our view of prokaryotic immunity obsolete. Most anti-phage systems have been studied as standalone mechanisms, however many examples demonstrate strains encode not one but several anti-viral mechanisms. How these different systems integrate into an anti-viral arsenal at the strain level remains to be elucidated. Much could be learned from establishing fundamental description of features such as the number and diversity of anti-phage systems encoded in a given genome. To address this question, we developed DefenseFinder, a tool that automatically detects known anti-phage systems in prokaryotic genomes. We applied DefenseFinder to >20 000 fully sequenced genomes, generating a systematic and quantitative view of the anti-viral arsenal of prokaryotes. We show prokaryotic genomes encode on average five anti-phage systems from three different families of systems. This number varies drastically from one strain to another and is influenced by the genome size and the number of prophages encoded. Distributions of different systems are also very heterogenous with some systems being enriched in prophages and in specific clades. Finally, we provide a detailed comparison of the anti-viral arsenal of 15 common bacterial species, revealing drastic differences in anti-viral strategies. Overall, our work provides a free and open-source software, available as a command line tool or, on a webserver. It allows the rapid detection of anti-phage systems, enables a comprehensive description of the anti-viral arsenal of prokaryotes and paves the way for large scale genomics study in the field of anti-phage defense.",

Providing an explicit counterfactual component, outcome of unchosen option alongside with the chosen one (Complete feedback), would increase the contextual effect by inducing comparison-based strategy during learning. But It is not clear in the conditions where the context consists only of the juxtaposition of a series of options, and there is no such explicit counterfactual component (Partial feedback), whether and how the relativity will be emerged. Here for investigating whether and how implicit and explicit counterfactual components can affect reinforcement learning, we used two Partial and Complete feedback paradigms, in which options were associated with some reward distributions. Our modeling analysis illustrates that the model which uses the outcome of chosen option for updating values of both chosen and unchosen options, which is in line with diffusive function of dopamine on the striatum, can better account for the behavioral data. We also observed that size of this bias depends on the involved systems in the brain, such that this effect is larger in the transfer phase where subcortical systems are more involved, and is smaller in the deliberative value estimation phase where cortical system is more needed. Furthermore, our data shows that contextual effect is not only limited to probabilistic reward but also it extends to reward with amplitude. These results show that by extending counterfactual concept, we can better account for why there is contextual effect in a condition where there is no extra information of unchosen outcome.",

Despite research efforts to define the role of various immune cells in MS pathogenesis, the focus has been on a few immune cell populations while full-spectrum analysis, encompassing others such as natural killer (NK) cells, has not been performed. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to profile the immune landscape of brain periventricular areas - septum and choroid plexus - and blood from MS donors and controls with and without other neurological diseases. Using a 37-marker panel, we revealed the infiltration of T cells and antibody-secreting cells in periventricular brain regions and identified a novel NK cell signature specific to MS. CD56bright NK cells accumulated in the septum of MS donors, displaying an activated and migratory phenotype that was similar to that of CD56bright NK cells in their circulation. We validated this signature by multiplex immunohistochemistry and found that NK cells with high expression of granzyme K, which is typical of the CD56bright subset, accumulated in both periventricular lesions and the choroid plexus. Together, our multi-tissue single-cell data suggests that CD56bright NK cells infiltrate the periventricular brain regions in MS patients via both the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers and brings NK cells to the spotlight of MS pathology.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that control this biological process are largely unknown. Here, we report a transcriptomic analysis on the Iberian mole, Talpa occidentalis, in which the desquamation of live, non-apoptotic germ cells is the major cellular event responsible for testis regression. By comparing testes at different reproductive states (active, regressing and inactive), we demonstrate that the molecular pathways controlling the cell adhesion function in the seminiferous epithelium, such as the MAPK, ERK and TGF-{beta} signalling, are altered during the regression process. In addition, inactive testes display a global upregulation of genes associated with immune response, indicating a selective loss of the \"immune privilege\" that normally operates in sexually active testes. Interspecies comparative analyses using analogous data from the Mediterranean pine vole, a rodent species where testis regression is controlled by halting meiosis entry, revealed a common gene expression signature in the regressed testes of these two evolutionary distant species. Our study advances in the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated to gonadal seasonal breeding, highlighting the existence of a conserved transcriptional program of testis involution across mammalian clades.\n\nResearch HighlightsBy comparing the trascriptomes of the testes from males of the iberian mole, Talpa occidentalis (order Eulipotyphla), captured at different stages of the seasonal breeding cycle of this species, we show that two main functions are altered during seasonal testis regression: cell adhesion and immune response. The fact that the same functions alre also altered in the Mediterranean pine vole, Microtus duodecimcostatus (order Rodentia), evidences the existence of a conserved transcriptional program of testis regression across mammalian clades.",

A key limitation to their implementation is minimal standardization in EV isolation and analytical analysis methods. Further, most urinary EV isolation protocols necessitate large volumes of sample. This study aimed to compare and optimize isolation and analytical methods for EVs from small volumes of urine.\n\nMethods3 EV isolation methods were compared: ultracentrifugation, magnetic bead-based, and size-exclusion chromatography from 0.5 mL or 1 mL of rat and human urine. EV yield and mass spectrometry signals (Q-ToF and Triple Quad) were evaluated from each method. Metabolomic profiling was performed on EVs isolated from the urine of rats exposed to ionizing radiation 1-, 14-, 30- or 90-days post-exposure, and human urine from patients receiving thoracic radiotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer pre- and post-treatment.\n\nResultsSize-exclusion chromatography is the preferred method for EV isolation from 0.5 mL of urine. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses of EV cargo identified biochemical changes induced by radiation, including altered nucleotide, folate, and lipid metabolism. We have provided standard operating procedures for implementation of these methods in other laboratories.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that EVs can be isolated from small volumes of urine and analytically investigated for their biochemical contents to detect radiation induced metabolomic changes. These findings lay a groundwork to develop future methods to monitor response to radiotherapy and can be extended to an array of molecular phenotyping studies aimed at characterizing EV cargo.",

It is generally known that niche adaptation plays an important role in shaping the signaling repertoire. However, the evolution of bacterial signaling capacity lacks systematic studies with a temporal direction. Particularly, it is unclear how complexity evolved from simplicity or vice versa for signaling networks. Here we examine the evolutionary processes of major signal transduction systems in Campylobacterota (formerly Epsilonproteobacteria), a phylum with sufficient evolutionary depth and ecological diversity. Evolution of signaling systems within Campylobacterota shows two opposite trends. During niche expansion, signaling complexity increases with gene expansions through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), gene duplication, fusion and fission, which create opportunities for genetic innovation and pathway integration. In contrast, as the lineages adapt to a specialized niche, complexity decreases with massive gene losses that lead to the decline or disappearance of pathways mediated by multiple transmitters. Overall, signaling capacity and complexity arise and drop together in Campylobacterota, determined by sensory demand, genetic resources and co-evolution within the genomic context. These findings reflects plausible evolutionary principles for other cellular networks and genome evolution of the Bacteria domain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Despite the worldwide availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), approximately 150,000 pediatric HIV infections continue to occur annually. ART can dramatically reduce HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), but inconsistent drug access and adherence, as well as primary maternal HIV infection during pregnancy and lactation are major barriers to eliminating vertical HIV transmission. Thus, immunologic strategies to prevent MTCT, such as an HIV vaccine, will be required to attain an HIV-free generation. A primary goal of HIV vaccine research has been to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) given the ability of passive bnAb immunization to protect against sensitive strains, yet we previously observed that HIV-transmitting mothers have more plasma neutralization breadth than non-transmitting mothers. Additionally, we have identified infant transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses that escape maternal bnAb responses. In this study, we examine a cohort of postpartum HIV-transmitting women with neutralization breadth to determine if certain maternal bnAb specificities drive the selection of infant T/F viruses. Using HIV pseudoviruses that are resistant to neutralizing antibodies targeting common bnAb epitopes, we mapped the plasma bnAb specificities of this cohort. Significantly more transmitting women with plasma bnAb activity had a mappable plasma bnAb specificity (six of seven, or 85.7%), compared to that of non-transmitting women with plasma bnAb activity (seven of twenty-one, or 33.3%, p=0.029 by 2-sided Fisher exact test). Our study suggests that having multispecific broad activity and/or uncommon epitope-specific bnAbs in plasma may be associated with protection against the vertical HIV transmission in the setting of maternal bnAb responses.\n\nImportanceAs mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV plays a major part in the persistence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and bnAb-based passive and active vaccines are a primary strategy for HIV prevention, research in this field is of great importance. While previous MTCT research has investigated the neutralizing antibody activity of HIV-infected women, this is to our knowledge the largest study identifying differences in bnAb specificity of maternal plasma between transmitting and non-transmitting women. Here, we show that among HIV-infected women with broad and potent neutralization activity, more postpartum-transmitting women had a mappable plasma broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) specificity, compared to that of non-transmitting women, suggesting that the non-transmitting women more often have multi-specific bnAb responses or bnAb responses that target uncommon epitopes. Such responses may be required for protection against vertical HIV transmission in the setting of maternal bnAb responses.",

Yet, little is known about viruses infecting parasitic hosts except for blood-feeding arthropods that are well-known vectors of zoonotic viruses. Herein we uncover viruses of flatworms (Phylum Platyhelminthes, group Neodermata) that specialize in parasitizing vertebrates and their ancestral free-living relatives. We discovered 115 novel viral sequences, including 1 in Macrostomorpha, 5 in Polycladida, 44 in Tricladida, 1 in Monogenea, 15 in Cestoda and 49 in Trematoda, through data mining. The majority of newly identified viruses constitute novel families or genera. Phylogenetic analyses show that the virome of flatworms changed dramatically during the transition of Neodermatans to a parasitic lifestyle. Most Neodermatan viruses seem to co-diversify with their host, with the exception of rhabdoviruses which may switch host more often, based on phylogenetic relationships. Neodermatan rhabodviruses also have an ancestral position to vertebrate-associated viruses, including Lyssaviruses, suggesting that vertebrate rhabdoviruses emerged from a flatworm rhabdovirus in a parasitized host. This study reveals an extensive diversity of viruses in Platyhelminthes and highlights the need to evaluate the role of viral infection in flatworm-associated diseases.",

Root exudate treatments were added to laboratory soil reactors and 16S rRNA gene profiling illustrated distinct microbial membership in response to HST or HOT amendments. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were significantly different between treatments, (Shannons, p < 0.0001, mrpp = 0.01, respectively). Exometabolite production was highest in the HST, with increased production of key organic acids, non-proteinogenic amino acids, and three plant growth-promoting phytohormones (benzoic acid, salicylic acid, indole-3-acetic acid), suggesting plant-derived sugars fuel microbial carbon metabolism and contribute to phytohormone production. Linking the metabolic capacity of metagenome-assembled genomes in the HST to the exometabolite patterns, we identified potential plant growth-promoting microorganisms that could produce these phytohormones. Our findings emphasize the tractability of high-resolution multi-omics tools to investigate soil microbiomes, opening the possibility of manipulating native microbial communities to improve specific soil microbial functions and enhance crop production.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding interactions between plant root exudates and the soil microbiome provides an avenue for a more comprehensive appreciation for how plant roots modulate their microbial counterparts to promote an environment favorable to plant fitness. Although these dynamics are appreciated as indispensable, mechanisms controlling specific rhizobiome membership and complexity are not fully understood. In this study, we investigate how variability in root exudation, modeled after differences observed between distinct sorghum genotypes, contributes to altered microbial membership and metabolisms. The results demonstrate how microbial diversity is influenced by root exudates of differing chemical composition and how changes in microbial membership correspond to modifications in carbon utilization and enhance production of plant-relevant metabolites. Our findings suggest carbon substrate preferences among bacteria in semi-arid climate soils and mechanisms for root exudate utilization. These findings provide new information on plant-soil environments useful for the development of efficient and precise microbiota management strategies in agricultural systems.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The diurnal peak of phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) is under circadian control, and it is believed that this process involves interactions from both the retina and RPE. Previous studies have demonstrated that a functional circadian clock exists within multiple retinal cell types and RPE cells. Thereby, the aim of the current study was to determine whether the circadian clock in the retina and or RPE controls the diurnal phagocytic peak of photoreceptor outer segments and whether selective disruption of the circadian clock in the RPE would affect RPE cells function and the viability during aging. To that aim, we first generated and validated an RPE tissue-specific KO of the essential clock gene, Bmal1, and then we determined the daily rhythm in phagocytic activity by the RPE in mice lacking a functional circadian clock in the retina or RPE. Then using electroretinography, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography, and optomotor response measurements of visual function we determined the effect of Bmal1 removal in young (6-month old) and old (18-month old) mice. RPE morphology and lipofuscin accumulation was also determined in young and old mice. Our data show that the circadian clock in the RPE controls the daily diurnal phagocytic peak of POS. Surprisingly, the lack of a functional RPE circadian clock or the diurnal phagocytic peak does not result in any detectable age-related degenerative phenotype in the retina or RPE. Thus, our results demonstrate that the loss of the circadian clock in the RPE or the lack of the daily peak in phagocytosis of POS does not result in deterioration of photoreceptors or the RPE during aging.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, and relapse during abstinence remains the key barrier to successful treatment of tobacco addiction. During abstinence, environmental contexts associated with nicotine use can induce craving and contribute to relapse. The insular cortex (IC) is thought to be a critical substrate of nicotine addiction and relapse. However, its specific role in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking is not fully known. In this study, we report a novel rodent model of context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence, which models self-imposed abstinence through increasing negative consequences of excessive drug use. Using the neuronal activity marker Fos we find that the anterior (aIC), but not the middle or posterior IC, shows increased activity during context-induced relapse. Combining Fos with retrograde labelling of aIC inputs, we show projections to aIC from contralateral aIC and basolateral amygdala exhibit increased activity during context-induced relapse. Next, we used fiber photometry in aIC and observed phasic increases in aIC activity around nicotine-seeking responses during self-administration, punishment, and the context-induced relapse tests. Next, we used chemogenetic inhibition in both male and female rats to determine whether activity in aIC is necessary for context-induced relapse. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of aIC decreased context-induced nicotine-seeking after either punishment- or extinction-imposed abstinence. These findings highlight the critical role nicotine-associated contexts play in promoting relapse, and they show that aIC activity is critical for this context-induced relapse following both punishment and extinction imposed abstinence.",

In the larval stage, zebrafish present a broad behavioral repertoire and physiological responses similar to adults. Curcumin (CUR), a major component of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), has demonstrated the ability to modulate several neurobiological processes relevant to mental disorders in animal models. However, the low bioavailability of this compound can compromise its in vivo biological potential. Interestingly, it has been shown that micronization can increase the biological effects of several compounds. Thus, in this study, we compared the effects of acute exposure for 30 minutes to the following solutions: water (control), 0.1% DMSO (vehicle), 1 M CUR, or 1 M micronized curcumin (MC) in zebrafish larvae 7 days post-fertilization (dpf). We analyzed locomotor activity (open tank test), anxiety (light/dark test), and avoidance behavior (aversive stimulus test). Moreover, we evaluated parameters of oxidative status (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and non-protein thiols levels). MC increased the total distance traveled and absolute turn angle in the open tank test. There were no significant differences in the other behavioral or neurochemical outcomes. The increase in locomotion induced by MC may be associated with a stimulant effect on the central nervous system, which was evidenced by the micronization process.",

Here we show that local enrichment of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in axons of Drosophila mushroom body neurons is necessary for cellular plasticity and associative memory formation. Enrichment is achieved via enhanced axoplasmic translation of CaMKII mRNA, through a mechanism requiring the RNA-binding protein Mub and a 23-base Mub-recognition element in the CaMKII 3UTR. Perturbation of either dramatically reduces axonal, but not somatic, CaMKII protein without altering the distribution or amount of mRNA in vivo and both are necessary and sufficient to enhance axonal translation of reporter mRNA. Together, these data identify elevated levels of translation of an evenly distributed mRNA as a novel strategy for generating subcellular biochemical asymmetries. They further demonstrate the importance of distributional asymmetry in the computational and biological functions of neurons.",

Whereas stem and progenitor cells proliferate, fully differentiated cells exit the cell cycle. How cell identity and cell cycle state are coordinated during this process is still poorly understood. The Drosophila testis niche supports germline stem cells and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs), which are the only proliferating somatic cells in the testis. CySCs give rise to post-mitotic cyst cells and therefore provide a tractable model to ask how stem cell identity is linked to proliferation. We show that the G1/S cyclin, Cyclin E, is required for CySC self-renewal; however, its canonical transcriptional regulator, a complex of the E2f1 and Dp transcription factors is dispensable for self-renewal and cell cycle progression. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that E2f1/Dp activity must be silenced to allow CySCs to differentiate. We show that E2f1/Dp activity inhibits the expression of genes important for mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, promoting mitochondrial activity or biogenesis is sufficient to rescue the differentiation of CySCs with ectopic E2f1/Dp activity but not their exit from the cell cycle. Our findings together indicate that E2f1/Dp coordinates cell cycle progression with stem cell identity by regulating the metabolic state of CySCs.",

To address this obstacle, we introduce BioKIT, a versatile toolkit for the UNIX shell environment with 40 functions, several of which were community-sourced, that conduct routine and novel processing and analysis of genome assemblies, multiple sequence alignments, coding sequences, sequencing data, and more. To demonstrate the utility of BioKIT, we assessed the quality and characteristics of 901 eukaryotic genome assemblies, calculated alignment summary statistics for 10 phylogenomic data matrices, determined relative synonymous codon usage across 171 fungal genomes including those that use alternative genetic codes, and demonstrate that a novel metric, gene-wise relative synonymous codon usage, can accurately estimate gene-wise codon optimization.

Previous work has shown that Drosophila cultured cells have a higher transposable element (TE) content than whole flies, but whether this increase in TE content resulted from an initial burst of transposition during cell line establishment or ongoing transposition in cell culture remains unclear. Here we sequence the genomes of 25 sub-lines of Drosophila S2 cells and show that TE insertions provide abundant markers for the phylogenetic reconstruction of diverse sub-lines in a model animal cell culture system. Analysis of DNA copy number evolution across S2 sub-lines revealed dramatically different patterns of genome organization that support the overall evolutionary history reconstructed using TE insertions. Analysis of TE insertion site occupancy and ancestral states support a model of ongoing transposition dominated by episodic activity of a small number of retrotransposon families. Our work demonstrates that substantial genome evolution occurs during long-term Drosophila cell culture, which may impact the reproducibility of experiments that do not control for sub-line identity.",

We used this data set to uncover a novel role for TRIM5 in mitophagy, an autophagy-based mode of mitochondrial quality control that is compromised in multiple human diseases. Mitochondrial damage triggered the relocalization of TRIM5 to ER-mitochondria contact sites where TRIM5 colocalized with markers of autophagy initiation and autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we found that TRIM5 knockout attenuated both Parkin-dependent and Parkin-independent mitophagy by preventing the recruitment of autophagy regulators FIP200 and ATG13 to unhealthy mitochondria. Finally, TRIM5 knockout cells showed reduced mitochondrial function under basal conditions and were more susceptible to uncontrolled immune activation and cell death in response to mitochondrial damage than were wild type cells.

These predictable shifts in metabolic flux allow the fly meet stage-specific requirements for energy production and biosynthesis. In this regard, the enzyme Glyerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH1) has been the focus of biochemical genetics studies for several decades, and as a result, is one of the most well characterized Drosophila enzymes. Among the findings of these earlier studies is that GPDH1 acts throughout the fly lifecycle to promote mitochondrial energy production and triglyceride accumulation while also serving a key role in maintaining redox balance. Here we expand upon the known roles of GPDH1 during fly development by examining how depletion of both the maternal and zygotic pools of this enzyme influences development, metabolism, and viability. Our findings not only confirm previous observations that Gpdh1 mutants exhibit defects in larval development, lifespan, and fat storage but also reveal that GPDH1 serves essential roles in oogenesis and embryogenesis. Moreover, metabolomics analysis reveals that a Gpdh1 mutant stock maintained in a homozygous state exhibits larval metabolic defects that significantly differ from those observed in the F1 mutant generation. Overall, our findings highlight unappreciated roles for GPDH1 in early development and uncover previously undescribed metabolic adaptations that could allow flies to survive loss of this key enzyme.",

    "preprint_abstract": "A distinct age-related alteration in the uterine environment has recently been identified as a prevalent cause of the reproductive decline in older female mice. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie age-associated uterine adaptability to pregnancy are not known. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a multifunctional NAD+-dependent deacetylase that regulates cell viability, senescence and inflammation during aging, is reduced in aged decidua. Thus, we hypothesize that SIRT1 plays a critical role in uterine adaptability to pregnancy and that uterine-specific ablation of Sirt1 gene accelerates premature uterine aging. Female mice with uterine ablation of Sirt1 gene using progesterone receptor Cre (PgrCre) exhibit subfertility and signs of premature uterine aging. These Sirt1-deficient mothers showed decreases in litter size from their 1st pregnancy and became sterile (25.1{+/-}2.5 weeks of age) after giving birth to the 3rd litter. We report that uterine-specific Sirt1 deficiency impairs invasion and spacing of blastocysts, and stromal cell decidualization, leading to abnormal placentation. We found that these problems traced back to the very early stages of hormonal priming of the uterus. During the window of receptivity, Sirt1 deficiency compromises uterine epithelial-stromal crosstalk, whereby estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4) and Indian hedgehog (IHH) signaling pathways are dysregulated, hampering stromal cell priming for decidualization. Uterine transcriptomic analyses also link these causes to perturbations of histone proteins and epigenetic modifiers, as well as adrenomedullin signaling, hyaluronic acid metabolism, and cell senescence. Strikingly, our results also identified genes with significant overlaps with the transcriptome of uteri from aged mice and transcriptomes related to master regulators of decidualization (e.g., Foxo1, Wnt4, Sox17, Bmp2, Egfr and Nr2f2). Our results also implicate accelerated deposition of aging-related fibrillar type I and III collagens in Sirt1-deficient uteri. Collectively, SIRT1 is an indispensable age-related regulator of invasion and spacing of blastocysts, as well as decidualization of stromal cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryAdvanced maternal age (i.e., [&ge;]35 years old) is considered a significant risk factor for birth defects, including fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, preterm birth, and preeclampsia. Lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoke, alcohol usage and other environmental toxins are facilitators of premature reproductive aging. Thus, understanding the precise mechanisms by which female reproductive organs age is a prerequisite for ultimately developing counteracting therapies. Much attention has been focused on ovarian function and oocyte quality, but we provide evidence that severe placentation defects are a major cause of age-related reproductive decline, which results from an impaired decidual response by uterine stromal cells. This problem is due to a blunted progesterone (P4) responsiveness of the aging uterus, via its cognate receptor, PGR. In the present study, the uterine SIRT1 gene was deleted to advance understanding of the genetics of premature uterine aging in a mouse model of blunted PGR actions that is similar to physiological aging. Our results have informed as to molecular changes in response to blunting PGR actions in aging uteri that are unrelated to oocyte quality, and provide new insights into strategies for developing counteracting measures for pregnancy in females at an advanced reproductive age.",

Deep learning based computational approaches emerge recently to help interpretating non-coding regions. Here we present LOGO (Language of Genome), a self-attention based contextualized pre-trained language model containing only 2 self-attention layers with 1 million parameters as a substantially light architecture that applies self-supervision techniques to learn bidirectional representations of unlabeled human reference genome. LOGO is then fine-tuned for sequence labelling task, and further extended to variant prioritization task via a special input encoding scheme of alternative alleles followed by adding a convolutional module. Experiments show that LOGO achieves 15% absolute improvement for promoter identification and up to 4.5% absolute improvement for enhancer-promoter interaction prediction. LOGO exhibits state-of-the-art multi-task predictive power on thousands of chromatin features with only 3% parameterization benchmarking against fully supervised model, DeepSEA and 1% parameterization against a recent BERT-based language model for human genome. For allelic-effect prediction, locality introduced by one dimensional convolution shows improved sensitivity and specificity for prioritizing non-coding variants associated with human diseases. In addition, we apply LOGO to interpret type 2 diabetes (T2D) GWAS signals and infer underlying regulatory mechanisms. We make a conceptual analogy between natural language and human genome and demonstrate LOGO is an accurate, fast, scalable, and robust framework to interpret non-coding regions for global sequence labeling as well as for variant prioritization at base-resolution.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cell-cell interactions are the fundamental building blocks of tissue organization and multicellular life. We developed Neighbor-seq, a method to identify and annotate the architecture of direct cell-cell interactions and relevant ligand-receptor signaling from the undissociated cell fractions in massively parallel single cell sequencing data. Neighbor-seq accurately identifies microanatomical features of diverse tissue types such as the small intestinal epithelium, terminal respiratory tract, and splenic white pulp. It also captures the differing topologies of cancer-immune-stromal cell communications in pancreatic and skin tumors, which are consistent with the patterns observed in spatial transcriptomic data. Neighbor-seq is fast and scalable. It draws inferences from routine single-cell data and does not require prior knowledge about sample cell-types or multiplets. Neighbor-seq provides a framework to study the organ-level cellular interactome in health and disease, bridging the gap between single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.",

We suggest that when presented with a novel object, observers identify its significant features and infer a generative model of its shape, allowing them to mentally synthesize plausible variants. To test this, we showed participants abstract 2D shapes ( Exemplars) and asked them to draw new objects ( Variations) belonging to the same class. We show that this procedure created genuine novel categories. In line with our hypothesis, particular features of each Exemplar were preserved in its Variations and there was striking agreement between participants about which shape features were most distinctive. Also, we show that strategies to create Variations were strongly driven by part structure: new objects typically modified individual parts (e.g., limbs) of the Exemplar, often preserving part order, sometimes altering it. Together, our findings suggest that sophisticated internal generative models are key to how humans analyze and generalize from single exemplars.",

Individuals with PTHS typically present in the first year of life with developmental delay and exhibit intellectual disability, lack of speech, and motor incoordination. There are no effective treatments available for PTHS, but the root cause of the disorder, TCF4 haploinsufficiency, suggests that it could be treated by normalizing TCF4 gene expression. Here we performed proof-of-concept viral gene therapy experiments using a conditional Tcf4 mouse model of PTHS and found that postnatally reinstating Tcf4 expression in neurons improved anxiety-like behavior, activity levels, innate behaviors, and memory. Postnatal reinstatement also partially corrected EEG abnormalities, which we characterized here for the first time, and the expression of key TCF4-regulated genes. Our results support a genetic normalization approach as a treatment strategy for PTHS, and possibly other TCF4-linked disorders.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Understanding the maturation process of human physiology and metabolism has broad medical and pharmaceutical implications. Age and bodyweight are frequently considered as separate variables in modeling the dynamical changes of human organ functions and of drug clearance from birth to adulthood. The objective of this study is to propose a unified, continuous and bodyweight-only equation to quantify the changes of human basal metabolic rate (BMR), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and drug clearance (CL) from infancy to adulthood. The BMR datasets were retrieved from a comprehensive historical database of male and female subjects (0.02 to 64 years). The CL datasets for 17 drugs and the GFR dataset were generated from age-incorporated maturation-and-growth models with reported parameter values. The model used in the simulation is independent of the proposed model. A statistical approach was used to simulate the model generated CL and GFR data for a hypothetical population with 26 age groups (ranging from 0 to 20 years). Besides, individual CL data for one drug, and sparse PBPK-modeled CL values for two drugs were also included for analysis. A 4-parameter, mixed-allometry equation with two power-law functions of bodyweight was proposed and evaluated as a general model using nonlinear regression and dimensionless analysis. All datasets universally reveal biphasic curves with two distinct linear segments on log-log plots. Compared with simple allometry, the biphasic model fits satisfactorily to all datasets (based on Akaikes Information Criterion and residual plots). The biphasic equation consists of two reciprocal allometric terms that asymptotically determine the overall curvature. The fitting results show a superlinear scaling phase (slope >1; ca. 1.5 - 3.5) below the characteristic bodyweight at the phase transition; and above which, a sublinear scaling phase (slope <1; ca. 0.5 - 0.7) is evident. The phase-transition bodyweight is ranging from 5 to 20 kg (corresponding to 0.5 - 9 years) and the mean value is around 10 kg ([~]2 years) for all data sets. The dimensionless analysis generalizes, and offers quantitative realization of, the maturation and growth process. In conclusion, the proposed mixed-allometry equation is a generic model that quantitatively describes the phase transition occurring in the human maturation process of BMR, GFR and drug CL.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that ephaptic coupling leads to the synchronisation and slowing down of spikes propagating along the axons within peripheral nerve bundles. However, the main focus thus far has been on a small number of identical axons, whereas realistic peripheral nerve bundles contain numerous axons with different diameters. Here, we present a computationally efficient spike propagation model, which captures the essential features of propagating spikes and their ephaptic interaction, and facilitates the theoretical investigation of spike volleys in large, heterogeneous fibre bundles. The spike propagation model describes an action potential, or spike, by its position on the axon, and its velocity. The velocity is primarily defined by intrinsic features of the axons, such as diameter and myelination status, but it is also modulated by changes in the extracellular potential. These changes are due to transmembrane currents that occur during the generation of action potentials. The resulting change in the velocity is appropriately described by a linearised coupling function, which is calibrated with a biophysical model. We first lay out the theoretical basis to describe how the spike in an active axon changes the membrane potential of a passive axon. These insights are then incorporated into the spike propagation model, which is calibrated with a biophysically realistic model based on Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. The fully calibrated model is then applied to fibre bundles with a large number of axons and different types of axon diameter distributions. One key insight of this study is that the heterogeneity of the axonal diameters has a dispersive effect, and that with increasing level of heterogeneity the ephaptic coupling strength has to increase to achieve full synchronisation between spikes. Another result of this study is that in the absence of full synchronisation, a subset of spikes on axons with similar diameter can form synchronised clusters. These findings may help interpret the results of noninvasive experiments on the electrophysiology of peripheral nerves.",

For machine learning based tools, very large training sets are necessary with sample-by-sample point labelled data (e.g., 1 sample point every 100microsecond). In an experimental context, such data are labelled with human supervision, and whilst this is feasible for simple experimental analysis, it is infeasible to generate the enormous datasets that would be necessary for a big data approach using hand crafting. In this work we aimed to develop methods to generate simulated ion channel data that is free from assumptions and prior knowledge of noise and underlying hidden Markov models.\n\nWe successfully leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to build an end-to-end pipeline for generating an unlimited amount of labelled training data from a small annotated ion channel \"seed\" record, and this needs no prior knowledge of theoretical dynamical ion channel properties. Our method utilises 2D CNNs to maintain the synchronised temporal relationship between the raw and idealised record. We demonstrate the applicability of the method with 5 different data sources and show authenticity with t-SNE and UMAP projection comparisons between real and synthetic data. The model would be easily extendable to other time series data requiring parallel labelling, such as labelled ECG signals or raw nanopore sequencing data.",

Various methods have been described to create embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from embryonic or pluripotent stem cells but with varying levels of differentiation success and producing organoids of variable size. Commercial ultra-low attachment (ULA) V-bottom well plates are frequently used to generate EBs. These plates are relatively expensive and not as widely available as standard concave well plates. Here, we describe a cost-effective and low labor-intensive method that creates homogeneous EBs at high yield in standard V- and U-bottom well plates by applying an antiadherence solution to reduce surface attachment, followed by centrifugation to enhance cellular aggregation. We also explore the effect of different seeding densities, in the range of 1 to 11 x103 cells per well, for the fabrication of neuroepithelial EBs. Our results show that the use of V-bottom well plates briefly treated with anti-adherent solution (for 5 min at room temperature) consistently yields functional neural EBs in the range of seeding densities from 5 to 11x103 cells per well. A brief post-seeding centrifugation step further enhances EB establishment. EBs fabricated using centrifugation exhibited lower variability in their final size than their noncentrifuged counterparts, and centrifugation also improved EB yield. The span of conditions for reliable EB production is narrower in U-bottom wells than in V-bottom wells (i.e., seeding densities between 7x103 and 11x103 and using a centrifugation step). We show that EBs generated by the protocols introduced here successfully developed into neural organoids and expressed the relevant markers associated with their lineages.\n\nWe anticipate that the cost-effective and easily implemented protocols presented here will greatly facilitate the generation of EBs, thereby further democratizing the worldwide ability to conduct organoid-based research.",

However, they must remain dynamic in order to adapt to changing inputs. Here, we report that the enzyme biliverdin reductase (BVR) physically links together key molecules in focal adhesion signaling at the synapse. In challenging mice with a battery of neurocognitive tasks, we first discover that BVR null (BVR-/-) mice exhibit profound deficits in learning and memory. We uncover that these deficits may be explained by a loss of focal adhesion signaling that is both transcriptionally and biochemically disrupted in BVR-/- hippocampi. We learn that BVR mediates focal adhesion signaling by physically bridging the initiatory kinases FAK/Pyk2 to the effector kinase Src. Activated Src normally promotes synaptic plasticity by phosphorylating the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, but FAK/Pyk2 are unable to bind and stimulate Src without BVR. Src itself is a molecular hub upon which many signaling pathways converge in order to stimulate NMDA neurotransmission, positioning BVR at a prominent intersection of synaptic signaling.",

Despite the ubiquity and importance of this trait, the molecular mechanisms underlying repeatable individual differences in neophobia in wild animals are poorly understood. We evaluated wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus) for neophobia in the lab using novel object tests. We then selected the most and least neophobic individuals (n=3 of each) and extracted RNA from four brain regions involved in learning, memory, threat perception, and executive function: striatum, dorsomedial hippocampus, medial ventral arcopallium, and caudolateral nidopallium (NCL). Our analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) used 11,889 gene regions annotated in the house sparrow reference genome for which we had an average of 25.7 million mapped reads/sample. PERMANOVA identified significant effects of brain region, phenotype (neophobic vs. non-neophobic), and a brain region by phenotype interaction. Comparing neophobic and non-neophobic birds revealed constitutive differences in DEGs in three of the four brain regions examined: hippocampus (12% of the transcriptome significantly differentially expressed), striatum (4%) and NCL (3%). DEGs included important known neuroendocrine mediators of learning, memory, executive function, and anxiety behavior, including serotonin receptor 5A, dopamine receptors 1, 2 and 5 (downregulated in neophobic birds), and estrogen receptor beta (upregulated in neophobic birds). These results suggest that some of the behavioral differences between phenotypes may be due to underlying gene expression differences in the brain. The large number of DEGs in neophobic and non-neophobic birds also implies that there are major differences in neural function between the two phenotypes that could affect a wide variety of behavioral traits beyond neophobia.",

However, relevant environmental conditions and patterns of avian migration and reproduction are substantially different in the southern hemisphere. Through the sequencing and analysis of 333 unique AIV genomes collected from wild birds collected over 15 years we show that Australia is a global sink for AIV diversity and not integrally linked with the Eurasian gene pool. Rather, AIV are infrequently introduced to Australia, followed by decades of isolated circulation and eventual extinction. The number of co-circulating viral lineages varies per subtype. AIV haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes that are rarely identified at duck-centric study sites (H8-12) had more detected introductions and contemporary co-circulating lineages in Australia. Combined with a lack of duck migration beyond the Australian-Papuan region, these findings suggest introductions by long-distance migratory shorebirds. In addition, we found no evidence of directional or consistent patterns in virus movement across the Australian continent. This feature corresponds to patterns of bird movement, whereby waterfowl have nomadic and erratic rainfall-dependant distributions rather than consistent intra-continental migratory routes. Finally, we detected high levels of virus gene segment reassortment, with a high diversity of AIV genome constellations across years and locations. These data, in addition to those from other studies in Africa and South America, clearly show that patterns of AIV dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere are distinct from those in the temperate north.\n\nAuthor SummaryA result of the ever-growing poultry industry is a dramatic global increase in the incidence of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus outbreaks. In contrast, wild birds are believed to be the main reservoir for low pathogenic avian influenza A virus. Due to intensive research and surveillance of AIV in waterfowl in the Northern Hemisphere, we have a better understanding of AIV ecology and evolution in that region compared to the Southern Hemisphere, which are characterised by different patterns of avian migration and ecological conditions. We analysed 333 unique AIV genomes collected from wild birds in Australia to understand how Australia fits into global AIV dynamics and how viruses are maintained and dispersed within the continent of Australia.

    "preprint_abstract": "Viral superinfection occurs when multiple viral particles subsequently infect the same host. In nature, several viral species are found to have evolved diverse mechanisms to prevent superinfection (superinfection exclusion) but how this strategic choice impacts the fate of mutations in the viral population remains unclear. Using stochastic simulations, we find that genetic drift is suppressed when superinfection occurs, thus facilitating the fixation of beneficial mutations and the removal of deleterious ones. Interestingly, we also find that the competitive (dis)advantage associated with variations in life history parameters is not necessarily captured by the viral growth rate for either infection strategy. Putting these together, we then show that a mutant with superinfection exclusion will easily overtake a superinfecting population even if the latter has a much higher growth rate. Our findings suggest that while superinfection exclusion can negatively impact the long-term adaptation of a viral population, in the short-term it is ultimately a winning strategy.\n\nAuthor summaryViral social behaviour has recently been receiving increasing attention in the context of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of viral populations. One fascinating and still relatively poorly understood example is superinfection or co-infection, which occur when multiple viruses infect the same host. Among bacteriophages, a wide range of mechanisms have been discovered that enable phage to prevent superinfection (superinfection exclusion) even at the cost of using precious resources for this purpose. What is the evolutionary impact of this strategic choice and why do so many phages exhibit this behaviour? Here, we conduct an extensive simulation study of a phage population to address this question. In particular, we investigate the fate of viral mutations arising in an environment with a constant supply of bacterial hosts designed to mimic a \"turbidostat,\" as these are increasingly being used in laboratory evolution experiments. Our results show that allowing superinfection in the long-term yields a population which is more capable of adapting to changes in the environment. However, when in direct competition, mutants capable of preventing superinfection experience a very large advantage over their superinfecting counterparts, even if this ability comes at a significant cost to their growth rate. This indicates that while preventing superinfection can negatively impact the long-term prospects of a viral population, in the short-term it is ultimately a winning strategy.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based proteome analysis usually implies matching mass spectra of proteolytic peptides to amino acid sequences predicted from nucleic acid sequences. At the same time, due to the stochastic nature of the method when it comes to proteome-wide analysis, in which only a fraction of peptides are selected for sequencing, the completeness of protein sequence identification is undermined. Likewise, the reliability of peptide variant identification in proteogenomic studies is suffering. We propose a way to interpret shotgun proteomics results, specifically in data-dependent acquisition mode, as protein sequence coverage by multiple reads, just as it is done in the field of nucleic acid sequencing for the calling of single nucleotide variants. Multiple reads for each position in a sequence could be provided by overlapping distinct peptides, thus, confirming the presence of certain amino acid residues in the overlapping stretch with much lower false discovery rate than conventional 1%. The source of overlapping distinct peptides are, first, miscleaved tryptic peptides in combination with their properly cleaved counterparts, and, second, peptides generated by several proteases with different specificities after the same specimen is subject to parallel digestion and analyzed separately. We illustrate this approach using publicly available multiprotease proteomic datasets and our own data generated for HEK-293 cell line digests obtained using trypsin, LysC and GluC proteases. From 5000 to 8000 protein groups are identified for each digest corresponding to up to 30% of the whole proteome coverage. Most of this coverage was provided by a single read, while up to 7% of the observed protein sequences were covered two-fold and more. The proteogenomic analysis of HEK-293 cell line revealed 36 peptide variants associated with SNP, seven of which were supported by multiple reads. The efficiency of the multiple reads approach depends strongly on the depth of proteome analysis, the digesting features such as the level of miscleavages, and will increase with the number of different proteases used in parallel proteome digestion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475497v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d6ee2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ae8baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@652216org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a0d49b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Nevertheless, limited access to human placenta samples and the paucity of a proper in vitro model system has hampered our understanding of the mechanisms underlying early human placental development and placenta-associated pregnancy complications. To overcome these constraints, we established a simple procedure with a short-term treatment of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) in trophoblast stem cell culture medium (TSCM) to convert human primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to trophoblast stem-like cells (TSLCs). These TSLCs show not only comparable morphology and global gene expression profiles to bona fide human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) but also long-term self-renewal capacity with bipotency that allows the cells to differentiate into functional extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) and syncytiotrophoblasts (ST). These indicate that TSLCs are equivalent to genuine human TSCs. Our data suggest a straightforward approach to make human TSCs directly from pre-existing primed PSCs and provide a valuable opportunity to study human placenta development and pathology even from patients with placenta-related diseases.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSShort-term treatment of BMP4 in TSCM induces human primed PSCs into TSLCs\n\nTSLCs possess similar self-renewal and bipotency as bona fide TSCs\n\nGlobal gene expression profiling shows high similarity between TSLCs and TSCs\n\nTSLC-derived EVT and ST possess characteristics shown in TSC-derived counterparts",

Using camera footage, we documented food items delivered to nestling Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca, and subsequently sequenced the Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) in their faeces.

Modified primers reduced vertebrate reads to 0.03%, and yielded more spider DNA without significant changing the recovery of other arthropod taxa.\nC_LIO_LITo explore digestive biases, contents of stomachs and lower intestines were compared in eight adult male flycatchers, victims of competitors for nest boxes.

The relative abundances of size-adjusted prey counts and COI reads correlated at R = 0.85 (CI:0.68-0.94) at order level and at R=0.75 (CI:0.67-0.82) at family level. Each common order and all common taxa within Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera were retrieved in similar proportions, while the taxonomic resolution was higher in barcodes than in camera records.\nC_LIO_LIThis DNA metabarcoding validation demonstrates that quantitative arthropod diet analyses is possible in songbirds.

Previous studies showed that adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) vector induced overexpression of certain proteins can suppress or reverse the effects of aging in animal models. Here, we sought to determine whether the high-capacity cytomegalovirus vector can be an effective and safe gene delivery method for two such-protective factors: telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and follistatin (FST). We found that the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) carrying exogenous TERT or FST (MCMVTERT or MCMVFST) extended median lifespan by 41.4% and 32.5%, respectively. This is the first report of CMV being used successfully as both an intranasal and injectable gene therapy system to extend longevity. Treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance, physical performance, and prevented loss of body mass and alopecia. Telomere shortening seen with aging was ameliorated by TERT, and mitochondrial structure deterioration was halted in both treatments. Intranasal and injectable preparations performed equally well in safely and efficiently delivering gene therapy to multiple organs, with long-lasting benefits and without carcinogenicity or unwanted side effects.

Embryonic MAPK/ERK signaling contributes to both anterior to posterior patterning in the terminal regions and to dorsal to ventral patterning during oogenesis and embryonic stages. Here we describe a novel loss of function mutation in the Raf kinase gene, which leads to loss of ventral cell fates as seen through the loss of the ventral furrow, the absence of Dorsal/NF{kappa}B nuclear localization, the absence of mesoderm determinants Twist and Snail, and the expansion of TGF{beta}. Gene expression analysis showed cells adopting ectodermal fates much like loss of Toll signaling.

    "preprint_abstract": "Ecological and evolutionary processes can occur at similar time scales, and hence influence one another. There has been much progress in the development of metrics that quantify contributions of ecological and evolutionary components to trait change over time. However, many empirical evolutionary ecology studies document genetic differentiation among populations structured in space. In both time and space, the observed differentiation in trait values among populations and communities can be the result of interactions between non-evolutionary (phenotypic plasticity, changes in the relative abundance of species) and evolutionary (genetic differentiation among populations) processes. However, the tools developed so far to quantify ecological and evolutionary contributions to trait change are implicitly addressing temporal dynamics because they require directionality of change from an ancestral to a derived state. Identifying directionality from one site to another in spatial studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics is not always possible and often not desired. We here suggest three modifications to existing metrics so they allow the partitioning of ecological and evolutionary contributions to changes in population and community trait values across landscapes. Applying these spatially modified metrics to published empirical examples shows how these metrics can be used to generate new empirical insights and to facilitate future comparative analyses. The possibility to apply eco-evolutionary partitioning metrics to populations and communities in real landscapes is critical as it will broaden our capacity to quantify eco-evolutionary interactions as they occur in nature.",

In this study, we looked at presence of plastic in the diet of Asian elephant and other megaherbivores in the forest habitats of Haridwar and Lansdowne, Uttarakhand state, India. We collected dung and pellet samples from forest edges and forest interiors and quantified plastic particles and other anthropogenic waste present. Each anthropogenic waste item was measured, weighed and sub-categorized into the type of plastic or other categories. Thirty-two percent of the elephant dung samples showed presence of plastic and other waste. Plastic particles comprised of 85% of the waste recovered from the dung with 100% occurrence in elephant dung samples (mean 47.08{+/-}12.85 particles per sample). We found twice as many plastic particles (85.27{+/-}33.7 per 100g of dung samples) in forest samples as compared to forest edge samples (35.34{+/-}11.14 plastic particles/100g of dung samples). Other non-biodegradable anthropogenic waste recovered from elephant dung (glass, metal, rubber bands, clay pottery and tile pieces) was found to be much higher for forest samples (34.79{+/-}28.41 items/100g sample) as compared to forest edge samples (9.44{+/-}1.91items/100g). This study is the first systematic documentation of occurrence of non-biodegradable waste in the diet of Asian elephants. Dominance of plastic compared to other non-biodegradable material in elephant dung samples highlights its widespread use and poor waste segregation practices.

To adjudicate between these accounts, we designed a Posner-style cuing task in which male and female human participants made orientation judgments of targets appearing at one of four locations: up, down, right, or left. Critically, trials were blocked such that within a block the locations along one meridian alternated in status between attended and unattended, and targets never appeared at the other two, making them irrelevant. Analyses of the concurrently measured EEG signal were carried out on traditional narrowband alpha (8-14 Hz), as well as on two components resulting from the decomposition of this signal: periodic alpha; and the slope of the aperiodic 1/f-like component. Although data from right-left blocks replicated the familiar pattern of lateralized asymmetry in narrowband alpha power, with neither alpha signal could we find evidence for any difference in the time course at unattended versus irrelevant locations, an outcome consistent with the secondary-consequence interpretation of attention-related dynamics in the alpha band. Additionally, 1/f slope was lower at attended and unattended locations, relative to irrelevant, suggesting a tonic adjustment of physiological state.",

Fiber length scaling - the degree to which fiber length varies according to brain size - was overlooked. We investigated how fiber lengths within the corpus callosum, the most prominent white matter tract, vary according to brain size. The results showed substantial variation in length scaling among callosal fibers, replicated in two large healthy cohorts ([~]2000 individuals). The underscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the precentral gyrus and parietal cortices, whereas the overscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the prefrontal cortices. The variation in such length scaling was biologically meaningful: larger scaling corresponded to larger neurite density index but smaller fractional anisotropy values; cortical regions connected by the callosal fibers with larger scaling were more lateralized functionally as well as phylogenetically and ontogenetically more recent than their counterparts. These findings highlight an interaction between interhemispheric communication and organizational and adaptive principles underlying brain development and evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementBrain size varies across evolution, development, and individuals. Relative to small brains, the neural fiber length in large brains is inevitably increased, but the degree of such increase may differ between fiber tracts. Such a difference, if it exists, is valuable for understanding adaptive neural principles in large versus small brains during evolution and development. The present study showed a substantial difference in the length increase between the callosal fibers that connect the two hemispheres, replicated in two large healthy cohorts. Altogether, our study demonstrates that reorganization of interhemispheric fibers length according to brain size is intrinsically related to fiber composition, functional lateralization, cortical myelin content, evolutionary and developmental expansion.",

Our study aimed to determine conditions of heat-inactivation of HuNoV in freshwater clams (Corbicula japonica) using a recently developed HuNoV cultivation system employing stem-cell derived human intestinal enteroids (HIEs). We first measured the internal temperature of clam tissue in a water bath during boiling at 90 {degrees}C and found that approximately 2 minutes are required for the tissue to reach 90 {degrees}C. Next, GII.4 HuNoV was spiked into the center of the clam tissue followed by boiling at 90 {degrees}C for 1, 2, 3, or 4 minutes. The infectivity of the HuNoV in clam tissue homogenates was evaluated using HIEs. We demonstrated that HuNoV in unboiled clam tissue homogenates replicated in HIEs, whereas infectivity was lost in all boiled samples, indicating that heat treatment at 90 {degrees}C for 1 minute is sufficient to inactivate HuNoV in freshwater clams. To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the infectivity of HuNoV tolerability in shellfish using HIEs and our results will be informative to develop strategies to inactivate HuNoV in foods.",

Experimental evidence shows that these modifications are synapse-specific and that the long-lasting effects are associated with the sustained increase in concentration of specific proteins like PKM{zeta}. However, such proteins are likely to diffuse away from their initial synaptic location and spread out to neighboring synapses, potentially compromising synapse-specificity. In this paper we address the issue of synapse-specificity during memory maintenance. Assuming that the long-term maintenance of synaptic plasticity is accomplished by a molecular switch we perform simulations using the reaction-diffusion package in NEURON and analytical calculations to determine the limits of synaptic-specificity during maintenance. Moreover, we explore the effects of the diffusion and degradation rates of proteins and of the geometrical characteristics of dendritic spines on synapse specificty. We conclude that the necessary conditions for synaptic specificity during maintenance require that protein synthesis occurs in dendritic spines and that the activated dendritic spines exhibit small neck diameters.",

We used analytical and individual-based evolutionary models to explore how temporal variation in environmental conditions influences the spread of populations across a spatial environmental gradient. We find that temporal variation greatly alters our predictions for range dynamics compared to temporally static environments. When temporal variance is equal across the landscape, the fate of species (expansion vs. extinction) is determined by the interaction between the degree of temporal autocorrelation in environmental fluctuations and the steepness of the spatial environmental gradient. When the magnitude of temporal variance changes across the landscape, stable range limits form where this variance increases maladaptation sufficiently to prevent local persistence. These results illustrate the pivotal influence of temporal variation on the likelihood of populations colonizing novel habitats and the location of species range limits.",

However, the optimal method to maximize the proliferation and differentiation is challenging. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) which contains high levels of diverse growth factors that can stimulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the context of cardiac tissue regeneration\n\nObjectiveTo analyze the effect of PRP administration on the AMSCs differentiation into cardiomyocyte and compare to the group without PRP administration.\n\nMethodsThis study is a true experimental randomized post-test design study. AMSCs were isolated from adipose tissues and cultured until 4 passages. The samples were divided into 3 groups, i.e. negative control (-MEM), positive control (differentiation medium), and treatment group (PRP). The assessment of GATA-4 marker expression was conducted using flowcytometry on the fifth day and cTnT was conducted using immunocytochemistry on the tenth day to determine the differentiation to cardiomyocyte. Data analysis was conducted using T-test and One-Way ANOVA on normally distributed data determined through Shapiro Wilk test.\n\nResultsFlowcytometry on GATA-4 expression revealed significant improvement on PRP group compared to negative and positive controls (67.04 {+/-} 4.49 vs 58.15 {+/-} 1.23 p < 0.05; 67.04 {+/-} 4.49 vs 52.96 {+/-} 2.02 p < 0.05). This was supported by the results of immunocytochemistry on troponin expression which revealed significant improvement on PRP group compared to negative and positive controls (38.13 {+/-} 5.2 vs 10.73 {+/-} 2.39 p < 0.05; 38.13 {+/-} 5.2 vs 26.00 {+/-} 0.4 p < 0.05). This was concordant to the hypothesis which stated that there was an effect of PRP administration on AMSCs differentiation into cardiomyocyte.\n\nConclusionPRP administration on AMSCs culture significantly improve the differentiation to cardiomyocyte measured by GATA-4 and cTnT expressions.",

The collection of suitable datasets can take many years and disentangling the contributions of the environment and genetics to phenotypic change is not trivial. Furthermore, pedigree-based methods of obtaining individual breeding values have known biases. Here, we apply a genomic prediction approach to estimate breeding values of adult weight in a 35-year dataset of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). During the study period adult body weight decreased, but the underlying genetic component of body weight increased, at a rate that is unlikely to be attributable to genetic drift. Thus cryptic microevolution of greater adult body weight has probably occurred. Using genomic prediction to study microevolution in wild populations can remove the requirement for pedigree data, potentially opening up new study systems for similar research.",

We re-analyze a dataset published by Blanton et al (Science 2016) that modeled mice growth trajectories after microbiome implantation from nourished or malnourished children. We compare the fit and stability of different parameterizations of ANOVA and LME models; most models found the nourished vs. malnourished growth trajectories differed significantly. We show through simulation that the results from the two-way ANOVA and LME models are not always consistent.

The coiled-coil protein MTCL1 stabilizes microtubules nucleated from the Golgi membrane. Here, we report an MTCL1 paralog, MTCL2, which preferentially acts on the perinuclear microtubules accumulated around the Golgi. MTCL2 associates with the Golgi membrane through the N-terminal coiled- coil region and directly binds microtubules through the conserved C-terminal domain without promoting microtubule stabilization. Knockdown of MTCL2 significantly impaired microtubule accumulation around the Golgi as well as the compactness of the Golgi ribbon assembly structure. Given that MTCL2 forms parallel oligomers through homo-interaction of the central coiled-coil motifs, our results indicate that MTCL2 promotes asymmetric microtubule organization by crosslinking microtubules on the Golgi membrane. Results of in vitro wound healing assays further suggest that this function of MTCL2 enables integration of the centrosomal and Golgi-associated microtubules on the Golgi membrane, supporting directional migration. Additionally, the results demonstrated the involvement of CLASPs and giantin in mediating the Golgi association of MTCL2.",

Previous XROMM studies in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) have shown that more than 90% of suction power in high performance strikes comes from the axial musculature. Thus, the shape of the axial muscles and skeleton may impact suction feeding mechanics. Royal knifefish (Chitala blanci) have an unusual postcranial morphology, with a ventrally flexed vertebral column and relatively large mass of epaxial muscle. Based on their body shape, we hypothesized that royal knifefish would generate high power strikes by utilizing large neurocranial elevation, vertebral column extension, and epaxial shortening. As predicted, C. blanci generated high suction expansion power compared to the other three species studied to date (up to 160 W), which was achieved by increasing both the rate of volume change and the intraoral subambient pressure. The large epaxial muscle (25% of body mass) shortened at high velocities to produce large neurocranial elevation and vertebral extension (up to 41 deg, combined), as well as high muscle mass-specific power (up to 800 W kg-1). For the highest power strikes, axial muscles generated 95% of the power, and 64% of the axial muscle mass consisted of the epaxial muscles. The epaxial-dominated suction expansion of royal knifefish supports our hypothesis that postcranial morphology may be a strong predictor of suction feeding biomechanics.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTRoyal knifefish rely on their distinct postcranial morphology--with a curved vertebral column and large dorsal body muscles--to produce large neurocranial elevation and powerful suction feeding.",

We hypothesized that Drd1+ and Drd2+ neurons in the SC may play a role in promoting instinctive defensive responses.\n\nOptogenetic activation of Drd2+ neurons, but not Drd1+ neurons, in the SC triggered strong defensive behaviors. Chemogenetic inhibition of SC Drd2+ neurons decreased looming-induced defensive behavior, suggesting involvement of SC Drd2+ neurons in defensive responses. To further confirm this functional role of Drd2 receptors, pretreatment with the Drd2+ agonist quinpirole in the SC impaired looming-evoked defensive responses, suggesting an essential role of Drd2 receptors in the regulation of innate defensive behavior. Inputs and outputs of SC Drd2+ neurons were investigated using viral tracing: SC Drd2+ neurons mainly receive moderate inputs from the Locus Coeruleus (LC), whilst we did not find any incoming projections from other dopaminergic structures.

Since both clades evolutionarily diverged approximately 85 million years ago, it is critical to know to what extent the myelin protein composition has remained similar.

Conversely, multiple other proteins were identified exclusively or predominantly in human or mouse myelin. This is exemplified by peripheral myelin protein-2 (PMP2), which was specific to human CNS myelin, while tetraspanin-2 (TSPAN2) and connexin-29 (CX29/GJC3) were confined to mouse myelin. Assessing published scRNA-seq-datasets, human and mouse oligodendrocytes display well-correlating transcriptome profiles but divergent expression of distinct genes including Pmp2, Tspan2 and Gjc3.

A homolog of the gene encoding SigL is conserved in the diarrheagenic pathogen Clostridioides difficile. To explore the contribution of SigL to C. difficile biology, we generated sigL-disruption mutants (sigL::erm) in strains belonging to two phylogenetically distinct lineages - the human-relevant Ribotype 027 (strain BI-1) and the veterinary-relevant Ribotype 078 (strain CDC1). Comparative proteomics analyses of mutants and isogenic parental strains revealed lineage-specific SigL regulons. Concomitantly, loss of SigL resulted in pleotropic and distinct phenotypic alterations in the two strains. Sporulation kinetics, biofilm formation, and cell surface-associated phenotypes were altered in CDC1 sigL::erm relative to the isogenic parent strain, but remained unchanged in BI-1 sigL::erm. In contrast, secreted toxin levels were significantly elevated only in the BI-1 sigL::erm mutant relative to its isogenic parent. We also engineered SigL overexpressing strains and observed enhanced biofilm formation in the CDC1 background, and reduced spore titers as well as dampened sporulation kinetics in both strains. Thus, we contend that SigL is a key, pleiotropic regulator that dynamically influences C. difficiles virulence factor landscape, and thereby, its interactions with host tissues and co-resident microbes.\n\nContribution to the FieldAlternative sigma factors modulate bacterial gene expression in response to environmental and metabolic cues. C. difficile encodes multiple alternative sigma factors which mediate critical cellular processes. A Sigma-54 ortholog, SigL, is conserved across all sequenced strains, yet its function remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that SigL dynamically influences C. difficile biology in fundamental, but distinct, ways in two strains representing two clinically-relevant C. difficile phylogenetic lineages (ribotypes). Loss of SigL results in changes in sporulation kinetics, biofilm formation, alterations in cell surface properties, and secreted toxin levels in a strain-specific manner. SigL overexpression, however, uniformly impedes sporulation. Thus, SigL plays a fundamental role in regulating the expression of C. difficile virulence factors and likely profoundly impacts pathogenesis in a strain-specific manner.",

Here, we use layer-selective optogenetic manipulations in the primary auditory cortex to demonstrate that feedback inputs from L5 suppress the activity of superficial layers, contrary to the prediction from their excitatory connectivity. This suppressive effect is predominantly mediated by translaminar circuitry through intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, with an additional contribution of subcortical projections by pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Furthermore, L5 activation sharpened tone-evoked responses of superficial layers in both frequency and time domains, indicating its impact on cortical spectro-temporal integration.

Integrin recruits many proteins intracellularly, including a four protein complex (Kindlin, Integrin linked kinase (ILK), PINCH, and parvin). C. elegans muscle provides an excellent model to study integrin adhesion complexes. In C. elegans, UNC-112 (Kindlin) binds to the cytoplasmic tail of PAT-3 ({beta}-integrin) and to PAT-4 (ILK). We previously reported that PAT-4 binding to UNC-112 is essential for the binding of UNC-112 to PAT-3. Although there are crystal structures for ILK and a kindlin, there is no co-crystal structure available. To understand the molecular interaction between PAT-4 (ILK) and UNC-112 (Kindlin), we took a genetic approach. First, we isolated mutant PAT-4 proteins that cannot bind to UNC-112. Then, we isolated suppressor mutant UNC-112 proteins that restore interaction with mutant PAT-4 proteins. Second, these mutant PAT-4 proteins cannot localize to attachment structures in nematode muscle, but upon co-expression of an UNC-112 suppressor mutant protein, the mutant PAT-4 protein could localize to attachment structures. Third, overexpression of a mutant PAT-4 protein results in disorganization of the adhesion plaques at muscle cell boundaries, and co-expression of the UNC-112 supressor mutant protein alleviates this defect. Thus, we demonstrate that UNC-112 binding to PAT-4 is required for the localization and function of PAT-4 in integrin adhesion complexes in vivo. The missense mutations were mapped onto homology models of PAT-4 and UNC-112, and taking into account previously isolated mutations, we suggest a surface of PAT-4 that binds to UNC-112.",

This behavior is not yet well understood, so there is a pressing need for a predictive description of cell migration on such nanotopography that captures both the initiation of migration and the manner in which cell migration evolves. Here, we employ a three-dimensional, physics-based model to study cell guidance on asymmetric nanosawteeth. In agreement with experimental data, our model predicts that asymmetric sawteeth lead both to spontaneous motion and changes in motion phenotypes. Our model demonstrates that asymmetric nano-sawteeth induce a unidirectional bias in guidance direction that is dependent upon the actin polymerization rate and the sawtooth dimensions. Motivated by this model, an analysis of previously reported experimental data indicates that the degree of guidance by asymmetric nanosawteeth increases with the cell velocity.",

These impacts on the biophysical and physicochemical properties of spores can be studied on the single-cell level using optical tweezers. However, the effect of the trapping laser on spores germination rate is not fully understood. In this work, we assess the impact of 1064 nm laser light on the germination of Bacillus thuringiensis spores. The results show that the germination rate of spores after laser exposure follows a sigmoid dose-response relationship, with only 15 % of spores germinating after 20 J of laser light. Under anaerobic growth conditions, the percentage of germinating spores at 20 J increased to 65 %. The results thereby indicate that molecular oxygen is a major contributor to the germination-inhibiting effect observed. Thus, our study highlights the risk for optical trapping of spores and ways to mitigate it.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Persistent activity, the maintenance of neural activation over short periods of time in cortical networks, is widely thought to underlie the cognitive function of working memory. A large body of modeling studies has reproduced this kind of activity using cell assemblies with strengthened synaptic connections. However, almost all of these studies have considered persistent activity within networks with homogeneous neurons and synapses, making it difficult to judge the validity of such model results for cortical dynamics, which is based on highly heterogeneous neurons. Here, we consider persistent activity in a detailed, strongly data-driven network model of the prefrontal cortex with heterogeneous neuron and synapse parameters. Surprisingly, persistent activity could not be reproduced in this model without incorporating further constraints. We identified three factors that prevent successful persistent activity: heterogeneity in the cell parameters of interneurons, heterogeneity in the parameters of short-term synaptic plasticity and heterogeneity in the synaptic weights. Our model predicts that persistent activity is recovered if the heterogeneity in the activity of individual interneurons is diminished, which could be achieved by a homeostatic plasticity mechanism. Such a plasticity scheme could also compensate the heterogeneities in the synaptic weights and short-term plasticity when applied to the inhibitory synapses. Cell assemblies shaped in this way may be potentially targeted by distinct inputs or become more responsive to specific tuning or spectral properties. Furthermore, the model predicts that a network that exhibits persistent activity is not able to dynamically produce intrinsic in vivo-like irregular activity at the same time, because heterogeneous synaptic connections are required for these dynamics. Thus, the background noise in such a network must either be produced by external input or constitutes an entirely different state of the network, which is brought about, e.g., by neuromodulation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTo operate effectively in a constantly changing world, it is crucial to keep relevant information in mind for short periods of time. This ability, called working memory, is commonly assumed to rest on reverberating activity among members of cell assemblies. While effective in reproducing key results of working memory, most cell assembly models rest on major simplifications such as using the same parameters for all neurons and synapses, i.e., assuming homogeneity in these parameters. Here, we show that this homogeneity assumption is necessary for persistent activity to arise, specifically for inhibitory interneurons and synapses. Using a strongly data-driven network model of the prefrontal cortex, we show that the heterogeneities in the above parameters that are implied by in vitro studies prevent persistent activity. When homogeneity is imposed on inhibitory neurons and synapses, persistent activity is recovered. We propose that the homogeneity constraints can be implemented in the brain by means of homeostatic plasticity, a form of learning that keeps the activity of a network in a constant, homeostatic state. The model makes a number of predictions for biological networks, including a structural separation of networks responsible for generating persistent activity and spontaneous, noise-like activity.",

Using an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout based screening approach in immortalized murine monocytes we identified the transcription factor C/EBP{delta} as a central regulator of S100A8 and S100A9 expression. S100a8 and S100a9 expression was further controlled by the C/EBP{delta}-antagonists ATF3 and FBXW7. We confirmed the clinical relevance of this regulatory network in subpopulations of human monocytes in a clinical cohort of cardiovascular patients. Moreover, we identified specific C/EBP{delta}-binding sites within s100a8 and s100a9 promoter regions, and demonstrated that C/EBP{delta}-dependent JMJD3-mediated demethylation of H3K27me3 is indispensable for their expression. Overall, our work uncovered C/EBP{delta} as a novel regulator of S100A8 and S100A9 expression.

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacillus cereus spores, like most Bacillus spores, can survive for years, germinate when their surroundings become suitable, and spore germination proteins play an important role in the initiation of germination. Because germinated spores lose dormant spores extreme resistance, information on the function of germination proteins could be useful in developing new strategies to control B. cereus spores. Prior work has shown that: i) the channel protein SpoVAEa exhibits high frequency movement in the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (IM) in dormant spores of B. subtilis; ii) the formation of the foci termed the germinosome between two germination proteins, the germinant receptor GerR and the scaffold protein GerD, in developing spores of B. cereus is slower than foci formation by GerR and GerD individually. However, the dynamics of movement of SpoVAEa in B. cereus spores, and the behaviour of the germinosome in B. cereus spore germination are unclear. In this study, we found that SpoVAEa fluorescent foci in dormant spores of B. cereus move on the IM, but slower than in B. subtilis spores, and likely colocalize transiently with GerD-mScarlet-I in the germinosome. Our results further indicate that: i) expression of GerR-SGFP2 and SpoVAEa-SGFP2 with GerD-mScarlet-I from a plasmid leads to more heterogeneity and lower efficiency of spore germination in B. cereus; and ii) germinosome foci observed by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between GerR-SGFP2 and GerD-mScarlet-I b can be lost soon after the spore phase transition. However this is not always the case, as some GerR-SGFP2 foci and GerD-mScarlet-I foci continued to exist, colocalize, and even show a weak FRET signal. These data highlight the heterogeneous behaviour of spore germination protein complexes and indicate that some complexes may persist well beyond the initiation of germination.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacillus cereus is commonly present in soil and does harm to humans via contaminated food. In this study, we used B. cereus spores to investigate the movement of the spore-specific channel protein SpoVAEa, the interaction between SpoVAEa and the germinosome scaffold protein GerD, as well as the dynamics of a number of germination proteins in spore germination. Our results expand upon observations of the interactions between specific B. cereus spore germination proteins, in particular the GerR germinant receptor A, B and C subunits and GerD, as well as between SpoVAEa and GerD. The approaches used in this work could also be used to examine the interactions between GerD and SpoVAEa and other germination proteins in spores of other Bacillus species.",

Here, we assess the impact of bacterial infection on pre-copulatory behaviours in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that male flies infected with six different bacteria, including pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains, show no significant differences in courtship intensity and mating success. Similarly, bacterial infections did not affect sexual receptivity in female flies.

We found neurons that serve as linear filters and robustly encode directional and speed information of translation-induced optic flow. These neurons are topographically arranged in pretectum according to translation direction. The unambiguous encoding of translation enables the decomposition of translational and rotational self-motion information from mixed optic flow.

Herein, we report a one-pot exosome proteomics method enabled by a photocleavable surfactant, Azo, for rapid and effective exosomal lysis, protein extraction, and digestion. We have applied this method to exosomes derived from isolated mammary fibroblasts and confidently identified 3,466 proteins and quantified 2,288 proteins using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. 3,166 (91%) of the identified proteins are annotated in the exosome/EVs databases, ExoCarta and Vesiclepedia, including important exosomal markers, CD63, PDCD6IP, and SDCBP.

Most centrioles have a signature 9-fold radial symmetry of microtubules that is imparted onto the axoneme of the cilia and flagella they template, with 9 centriolar microtubule doublets growing into 9 axonemal microtubule doublets. There are exceptions to the 9-fold symmetrical arrangement of axonemal microtubules, with lower or higher fold symmetries in some species. In the few cases where this has been examined, such alterations in axonemal symmetries are grounded in likewise alterations in centriolar symmetries. Here, we examine the question of microtubule number continuity between centriole and axoneme in flagellated gametes of the gregarine Lecudina tuzetae, which have been reported to exhibit a 6-fold radial symmetry of axonemal microtubules. We used time-lapse differential interference microscopy to identify the stage at which flagellated gametes are present. Thereafter, using electron microscopy and ultrastructure-expansion microscopy coupled to STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) super-resolution imaging, we uncover that a 6- or 5-fold radial symmetry in the axoneme is accompanied by an 8-fold radial symmetry in the centriole.

In this study, we searched for loci that influence germline mutagenesis using a uniquely powerful resource: a panel of recombinant inbred mouse lines known as the BXD, descended from the laboratory mouse strains C57BL/6J (B) and DBA/2J (D). Each BXD lineage has been maintained by brother-sister mating in the near absence of natural selection, accumulating de novo mutations for up to 50 years on a known genetic background that is a unique linear mosaic of B and D haplotypes. We show that mice inheriting D haplotypes at a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 4 accumulate C>A germline mutations at a 50% higher rate than those inheriting B haplotypes, primarily due to the activity of a C>A-dominated mutational signature known as SBS18. The B and D QTL haplotypes encode different alleles of the DNA repair gene Mutyh, which underlies the heritable colorectal cancer syndrome in which SBS18 was first identified. The B and D Mutyh alleles are present in wild populations of Mus musculus domesticus, providing evidence that common genetic variation modulates germline mutagenesis in a model mammalian species.",

Prevailing models propose that influenza-associated heart dysfunction is indirectly triggered by cytokine mediated cardiotoxicity downstream of the inflamed lung, rather than by direct infection of cardiac tissue. To test the etiology of cardiac dysfunction resulting from influenza virus infection, we generated a novel recombinant H1N1 influenza A virus that was attenuated in cardiomyocytes by incorporation of target sequences for miRNAs expressed specifically in that cell type (miR133b and miR206). Compared with control virus, mice infected with the miR-targeted virus had significantly reduced heart viral titers, confirming cardiac attenuation of viral replication. The miR-targeted virus, however, was fully replicative and inflammatory in lungs when compared to control virus, and induced similar systemic weight loss. The miR-targeted virus induced considerably lower levels of cardiac arrhythmia, fibrosis, and inflammation, compared with control virus, in mice lacking interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), which serve as the only available model for severe influenza-associated cardiac pathology. We conclude that robust replication of virus in the heart is required for pathology even when lung inflammation is severe. Indeed, we show that human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are susceptible to influenza virus infection. This work establishes a fundamental new paradigm in which influenza virus damages the heart through direct infection of cardiomyocytes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an inflammatory cytokine that, upon binding to its receptor TNFR1, can drive cytokine production, cell survival, or cell death and is a major component of an organisms anti-pathogen repetoire1,2. TNF stimulation leads to the formation of two distinct signalling complexes, a well-defined membrane bound complex (complex 1), and a less well characterised cytosolic death inducing complex (complex 2). Using mass spectrometry, we identified the ADP-ribosyltransferase, tankyrase-1 (TNKS1/TNKS/ARTD5/PARP5a) as a novel native complex 2 component. Following a TNF-induced death stimulus TNKS1 is recruited to complex 2, resulting in complex 2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). Tankyrase inhibitors sensitise cells to TNF-induced death, which is correlated with increased complex 2 assembly. Tankyrase-mediated PARylation promotes recruitment of the E3 ligase RNF146 and RNF146 deficiency or proteasome inhibition results in increased levels of complex 2, suggesting that RNF146 causes proteasomal degradation of complex 2. Several viruses express ADP-ribose binding macrodomain proteins, and expression of the SARS-CoV-2 or VEEV macrodomain markedly sensitises cells to TNF-induced death. This suggests that ADP-ribosylation serves as yet another mechanism to detect pathogenic interference of TNF signalling and retaliate with an inflammatory cell death.",

Most of these models have not been tested in dynamic visual environments where models must make predictions on future states and adjust their behavior accordingly. The models using these learning rules are often treated as black boxes, with little analysis on circuit architectures and learning mechanisms supporting optimal performance.\n\nHere we developed visual/motor spiking neuronal network models and trained them to play a virtual racket-ball game using several reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by the dopaminergic reward system. We systematically investigated how different architectures and circuit-motifs (feed-forward, recurrent, feedback) contributed to learning and performance. We also developed a new biologically-inspired learning rule that significantly enhanced performance, while reducing training time.\n\nOur models included visual areas encoding game inputs and relaying the information to motor areas, which used this information to learn to move the racket to hit the ball. Neurons in the early visual area relayed information encoding object location and motion direction across the network. Neuronal association areas encoded spatial relationships between objects in the visual scene. Motor populations received inputs from visual and association areas representing the dorsal pathway. Two populations of motor neurons generated commands to move the racket up or down. Model-generated actions updated the environment and triggered reward or punishment signals that adjusted synaptic weights so that the models could learn which actions led to reward.\n\nHere we demonstrate that our biologically-plausible learning rules were effective in training spiking neuronal network models to solve problems in dynamic environments. We used our models to dissect the circuit architectures and learning rules most effective for learning. Our model shows that learning mechanisms involving different neural circuits produce similar performance in sensory-motor tasks. In biological networks, all learning mechanisms may complement one another, accelerating the learning capabilities of animals. Furthermore, this also highlights the resilience and redundancy in biological systems.",

We recently found increased ANRIL abundance in human pancreatic islets from donors with certain Type II Diabetes (T2D) risk-SNPs, including a T2D risk-SNP located within ANRIL exon 2 associated with beta cell proliferation. Recent studies have found that expression of circular species of ANRIL is linked to the regulation of cardiovascular phenotypes. Less is known about how the abundance of circular ANRIL may influence T2D phenotypes. Herein, we sequence circular RNA in pancreatic islets to characterize circular isoforms of ANRIL. We identify highly expressed circular ANRIL isoforms whose expression is correlated across dozens of individuals and characterize ANRIL splice sites that are commonly involved in back-splicing. We find that samples with the T2D risk allele in ANRIL exon 2 had higher ratios of circular to linear ANRIL compared to protective-allele carriers, and that higher circular:linear ANRIL was associated with decreased beta cell proliferation. Our study points to a combined involvement of both linear and circular ANRIL species in T2D phenotypes and opens the door for future studies of the molecular mechanisms by which ANRIL impacts cellular function in pancreatic islets.",

Interregional LFP correlations across these brain regions showed smaller differences between awake and sleep states in aged mice. Multivariate analyses with machine learning algorithms with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and robust continuous clustering (RCC) demonstrated that these LFP correlational patterns in aged mice less represented awake/sleep states than those in young mice.

C. violaceum uses siderophore-based iron acquisition systems to overcome the host-imposed iron limitation, but its capacity to use other iron sources is unknown. In this work, we characterized ChuPRSTUV as a heme utilization system employed by C. violaceum to explore an important iron reservoir in mammalian hosts, free heme and hemoproteins. We demonstrate that the chuPRSTUV genes comprise a Fur-repressed operon that is expressed under iron limitation. The chu operon potentially encodes a small regulatory protein (ChuP), an outer membrane TonB-dependent receptor (ChuR), a heme degradation enzyme (ChuS), and an inner membrane ABC transporter (ChuTUV). Our nutrition growth experiments using C. violaceum chu deletion mutants revealed that, with the exception of chuS, all genes of the chu operon are required for heme and hemoglobin utilization in C. violaceum. The mutant strains without chuP displayed increased siderophore halos on CAS plate assays. Significantly, we demonstrate that ChuP connects heme and siderophore utilization by acting as a positive regulator of chuR and vbuA, which encode the TonB-dependent receptors for the uptake of heme (ChuR) and the siderophore viobactin (VbuA). Our data favor a model of ChuP as a heme-binding post-transcriptional regulator. Moreover, our virulence data in a mice model of acute infection demonstrate that C. violaceum uses both heme and siderophore for iron acquisition during infection, with a preference for siderophores over the Chu heme utilization system.",

Microplastics are present in terrestrial environments, yet the majority of studies have focused on the adverse effects of microplastics on aquatic biota. We hypothesized that microplastic ingestion by a terrestrial insect would have localized effects on gut health and nutrient absorption, such that prolonged dietary microplastic exposure would impact growth rate and adult body size. We further hypothesized that plastic form (fibres vs. beads) would influence these effects because of the nature of gut-plastic interactions. Freshly hatched tropical house crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) were fed a standard diet containing different concentrations of either fluorescent polyethylene microplastic beads (75-105 m), or untreated polyethylene terephthalate microfibers (<5 mm) until they died or reached adulthood (approximately 8 weeks). Weight and body length were measured weekly and microplastic ingestion was confirmed through fluorescence microscopy and visual inspection of the frass. While, to our surprise, we found no effect of polyethylene bead ingestion on growth rate or final body size of G. sigillatus, females experienced a reduction in size and weight when fed high concentrations of polyethylene terephthalate microfibers. These results suggest that high concentrations of polyethylene beads of the 100 m size range can pass through the cricket gut without a substantial negative effect on their growth and development time, but high concentrations of polyethylene terephthalate microfibers cannot. Although we report the negative effects of microplastic ingestion on the growth of G. sigillatus, it remains uncertain what threats microplastics pose to terrestrial insects.",

This architecture is built on a previously described interphase chromosome structure based on Cryo-EM cellular tomography (1), thus unifying chromosome structure throughout the complete mitotic cycle. The basic organizational principle, for mitotic chromosomes, is specific coiling of the 11-nm nucleosome fiber into large scale approximately 200 nm structures (a Slinky (2, motif cited in 3) in interphase, and then further modification and subsequent additional coiling for the final structure. The final mitotic chromosome architecture accounts for the dimensional values as well as the well known cytological configurations. In addition, proof is experimentally provided, by digital PCR technology, that G1 T-cell nuclei are diploid, thus one DNA molecule per chromosome. Many nucleosome linker DNA sequences, the promotors and enhancers, are suggestive of optimal exposure on the surfaces of the large-scale coils.\n\nSignificance StatementThe significance of this proposed mitotic chromosome architecture is that a specific, sequenced chromosome, human Chromosome 10, can be built into a specific architecture that accounts for the dimensional values and cytological descriptions, a first time result. Since this molecular architecture is an extension of the interphase chromosome structure, a coiling of the 11-nm nucleosome fiber with further coiling, a unifying molecular structure motif is present throughout the entire mitotic cycle, interphase through mitosis.",

Agroindustrial waste, such as fruit waste, can be used as substrates for producing bacteria. In this study, six samples of fruit waste, from oranges, mangoes and mixed fruits, were self-fermented, and then subjected to short-read metagenomic sequencing, so as to allow assessment of the potential of the associated microbiota for biosurfactant production. Taxonomic analysis using the DIAMOND+MEGAN analysis pipeline shows that all six samples are dominated by Proteobacteria, in particular, a common core consisting of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter and Escherichia. To support the interactive visualization and exploration of the surfactant-related genes in such samples, we have integrated the BiosurfDB classification into MEGAN and make this available. Functional analysis indicates high similarity among samples and that a significant number of reads map to genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of lipopeptide-class biosurfactants. Gene-centric analysis reveals Klebsiella as the main assignment for genes related to putisolvins biosynthesis. This suggests that fruit waste is a promising substrate for fermentative processes because the associated microbiota may be able to produce biosurfactants that are potentially useful for the agricultural, chemical, food and pharmaceutical industries.",

However, due to their small size, low complexity, degenerate nature, and frequent mutations, identifying novel functional motifs is a challenging task. Viral proteins rely extensively on the molecular mimicry of cellular linear motifs for modifying cell signalling and other processes in ways that favour viral infection. This study aims to discover human linear motifs convergently evolved also in disordered regions of viral proteins, under the hypothesis that these will result in enrichment in functional motif instances. We systematically apply computational motif prediction, combined with implementation of several functional and structural filters to the most recent publicly available human-viral and human-human protein interaction network. By limiting the search space to the sequences of viral proteins, we observed an increase in the sensitivity of motif prediction, as well as improved enrichment in known instances compared to the same analysis using only human protein interactions. We identified > 8,400 motif instances at various confidence levels, 105 of which were supported by all functional and structural filters applied. Overall, we provide a pipeline to improve the identification of functional linear motifs from interactomics datasets and a comprehensive catalogue of putative human motifs that can contribute to our understanding of the human domain-linear motif code and the mechanisms of viral interference with this.",

    "preprint_abstract": "While midbrain dopamine (DA) neuronal circuits are central to motivated behaviors, much remains unknown about our knowledge of how these circuits are modified over time by experience to facilitate selective aspects of experience-dependent plasticity. Most studies of the DA system in drug addiction focus on the role of the mesolimbic DA pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in facilitating drug-associated reward. In contrast, less is known about how midbrain DA cells and associated circuits contribute to negative affective states including anxiety that emerge during protracted withdrawal from drug administration. Here, we demonstrate the selective role of a midbrain DA projection to the amygdala (VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala) for anxiety that develops during protracted withdrawal from cocaine administration but does not participate in cocaine reward or sensitization. Our rabies virus-mediated circuit mapping approach revealed a persistent elevation in spontaneous and task-related activity of GABAergic cells from the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) and downstream VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala cells that could be detected even after a single cocaine exposure. Activity in BNSTGABA cells was related to cocaine-induced anxiety but not reward or sensitization, and silencing the projection from these cells to the midbrain was sufficient to prevent the development of anxiety during protracted withdrawal following cocaine administration. We observed that VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala cells, but not other midbrain DA cells, were strongly activated after a challenge exposure to cocaine, and found that activity in these cells was necessary for the expression of reinstatement of cocaine place preference. Lastly, the importance of activity in VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala cells extends beyond cocaine, as these cells mediate the development of anxiety states triggered by morphine and a predator odor. Our results provide an exemplar for how to identify key circuit substrates that contribute to behavioral adaptations and reveal a critical role for BNSTGABA[-&gt;]VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala pathway in anxiety states induced by drugs of abuse or natural experiences as well as cocaine-primed reinstatement of conditioned place preference.",

The gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) display system has emerged as a versatile and highly effective platform for delivering target proteins for vaccines. In this article, we developed a bacterium-like particle vaccine ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM based on the GEM-PA system. The fusion protein ZI-{Delta}-PA, which contains the prM-E-{Delta} protein of ZIKV (with a stem-transmembrane region deletion) and the protein anchor PA3, was expressed. The fusion protein was successfully displayed on the GEM surface, forming ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM. Moreover, when BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM combined with 201 VG and poly(I:C) adjuvants, durable ZIKV-specific IgG and protective neutralizing antibody responses were induced. Potent B cell/DC activation was also be stimulated early after immunization. Remarkably, splenocyte proliferation, the secretion of multiple cytokines, T/B cell activation and central memory T cell responses were elicited. These data indicate that ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM is a promising bacterium-like particle vaccine candidate for ZIKV.\n\nAuthor summaryBecause Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is considered as an example of \"disease X\", the development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is essential. The gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) display system has been used in many vaccine studies due to its advantages. In this study, prM-E-{bigtriangleup} protein of ZIKV (with a stem-transmembrane region deletion) and the protein anchor PA3 was fusion expressed, termed ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA. Then the fusion protein ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA could be displayed on the surface of GEM, forming ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM. The author evaluated the immunogenicity of ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM with the 201 VG and poly(I:C) adjuvants. The study demonstrates that ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM induced mice to produce neutralizing antibody and specific cellular immune responses. The author believe that the bacterium-like particle vaccine ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM has the potential to be used as the ZIKV vaccine.",

Its worst predictions were for NMR structures, which has two alternative explanations: either the NMR structures were poor, implying that AlphaFold may be more accurate than NMR; or there is a genuine difference between crystal and solution structures. Here, we use the program ANSURR, which measures the accuracy of solution structures, and show that one of the NMR structures was indeed poor. We then compare AlphaFold predictions to NMR structures, and show that AlphaFold tends to be more accurate than NMR ensembles, in particular correctly more rigid in loops. There are however some cases where the NMR ensembles are more accurate. These tend to be dynamic structures where AlphaFold had low confidence. We suggest that AlphaFold could be used as the model for NMR structure refinements, and that AlphaFold structures validated by ANSURR require no further refinement.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the identification and approach of X chromosome pairs in the crowded nucleus are unclear. To elucidate the driving force of Xic pairing, we developed a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model of intranuclear chromosomes in ES cells and in cells 2 days after the onset of differentiation (2-days cells) by considering intrachromosome epigenetic-structural feature-dependent mechanics. The analysis of the experimental data showed X-chromosomes change to specifically softer than autosomes during the cell differentiation by the rearrangement of their distributions of open-close chromatin regions, and the simulations of these models exhibited such softening promoted the mutual approach of the Xic pair. These findings suggested that local intrachromosomal epigenetic features may contribute to the regulation of cell species-dependent differences in intranuclear architecture.",

As species traits are a legacy of species evolutionary history, one might expect that the mode of trait evolution influences community resistance under the loss of functional diversity. In this paper, we investigate the role of trait evolutionary dynamics on the robustness of mutualistic networks undergoing the following scenarios of species loss: i) random extinctions, ii) loss of functional distinctiveness and iii) extinctions biased towards larger sizes. We simulated networks defined by models of single trait complementary and evolutionary modes where traits can arise in recent diversification events with weak phylogenetic signal, in early diversification events with strong phylogenetic signal, or as a random walk through evolutionary time. Our simulations show that mutualistic networks are especially vulnerable to extinctions based on trait distinctiveness and more robust to random extinction dynamics. The networks show an intermediate level of robustness against size-based extinctions. Despite the small range of variation in network robustness, our results show that the mode of trait evolution matters for network robustness in all three scenarios. Networks with low phylogenetic signal are more robust than networks with high phylogenetic signal across all scenarios. As a consequence, our results predict that mutualistic networks based upon current adaptations are more likely to cope with extinction dynamics than those networks that are based upon conserved traits.",

It is unique among anesthetics because urethane anesthesia alternates between macroscopically distinct electrographic states: a slow-wave state that resembles NREM sleep (NREMure), and an activated state with features of both REM sleep and wakefulness (REMure). However, the relationship between urethane anesthesia and physiological sleep is still unclear. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography were recorded in chronically prepared rats during natural sleep-wake states and during urethane anesthesia. We subsequently analyzed the EEG signatures associated with the loss of consciousness and found that, in comparison to natural sleep-wake states, the power, coherence, directed connectivity and complexity of brain oscillations are distinct during urethane. We also demonstrate that both urethane states have clear EEG signatures of general anesthesia. Thus, despite superficial similarities that have led others to conclude that urethane is a model of sleep, the electrocortical traits of depressed and activated states during urethane anesthesia differ from physiological sleep states.",

We hypothesised that maternal obesity alters fetal cardiac expression of metabolism-related genes and shifts offspring myocardial substrate preference from glucose towards lipids. Female mice were fed control or obesogenic diets before and during pregnancy. Fetal hearts were studied in late gestation (embryonic day, E18.5; term{approx}E21) and offspring were studied at 3, 6, 9 or 24 months postnatally. Maternal obesity increased heart weight and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor {gamma} (Pparg) expression in female and male fetuses and caused left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in the adult offspring. Cardiac dysfunction progressively worsened with age in female, not male, offspring of obese dams, compared to age-matched controls. In 6-month-old offspring, exposure to maternal obesity increased cardiac palmitoyl carnitine-supported mitochondrial respiration in males and reduced myocardial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in females. Cardiac Pparg expression remained higher in adult offspring of obese than control dams and correlated with contractile and metabolic function. Maternal obesity did not affect cardiac palmitoyl carnitine respiration in females or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in males, or alter cardiac 3H-oleic acid uptake, pyruvate respiration, lipid content or fatty acid/glucose transporter abundance in offspring of either sex. The results support our hypothesis and show that maternal obesity affects offspring cardiac metabolism in a sex-dependent manner. Persistent upregulation of Pparg expression in response to overnutrition in utero may mechanistically underpin programmed cardiac impairments and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk in children of women with obesity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Many reproductive parasites such as Wolbachia spread within host populations by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI occurs when parasite-modified sperm fertilizes uninfected eggs. In haplodiploid hosts, CI can lead to different phenotypes depending on whether the fertilized eggs die or develop into males. Genetic conflict theories predict the evolution of host modulation of CI, which in turn strongly influences the stability of reproductive parasitism. Yet, despite the ubiquity of CI-inducing parasites in nature, there is no conclusive evidence for strong intraspecific host modulation of CI strength and phenotype. Here, we tested for intraspecific host modulation of Wolbachia-induced CI in haplodiploid Tetranychus spider mites. Using a single CI-inducing Wolbachia variant and mitochondrion, a Tetranychus urticae nuclear panel was created that consisted of infected and cured near-isogenic lines. We performed a highly replicated age-synchronized full diallel cross comprised of incompatible and compatible control crosses. We uncovered host modifier systems that strongly suppress CI strength when carried by infected T. urticae males. Interspecific crosses showed that the male modifier systems suppress CI strength across species boundaries. We also observed a continuum of CI phenotypes in our crosses and identified strong intraspecific female modulation of CI phenotype when paired with a specific male genotype. Crosses established a recessive genetic basis for the maternal effect and were consistent with polygenic Mendelian inheritance. Our findings identify spermatogenesis as an important target of selection for host suppression of CI strength and underscore the importance of maternal genetic effects for the CI phenotype. Both mechanisms interacted with the genotype of the mating partner, revealing that intraspecific host modulation of CI strength and phenotype is underpinned by complex genetic architectures.",

There is evidence in mammals that thyroid hormones are also an important component of the hormonal system that controls reproduction, although studies in fish remain poorly investigated. Here we tested this hypothesis by investigating the effects of methimazole-induced hypothyroidism on the testicular function in adult D. rerio. Treatment of fish with methimazole, in vivo, significantly affected the progression of zebrafish spermatogenesis by inducing the accumulation of pre-meiotic cells, delaying cell differentiation and meiosis, as well as reducing the number of spermatozoa. The observed impairment of spermatogenesis by methimazole was correlated with significant changes in transcript levels for several genes involved in the control of reproduction. Using an in vitro approach, we also demonstrated that in addition to affecting the components of the brain-pituitary-peripheral axis, T3 also exerts direct action at the level of the testis. These results support the hypothesis that thyroid hormones are an essential component of multifactorial control of reproduction and testicular function in zebrafish and possibly other vertebrates.",

In this study, the microbial and physicochemical characteristics of plasma bubbling of raw cow milk were analysed and a comparison of boiled raw cow milk, commercially available pasteurised and UHT milk was observed. Again, shelf-life study was experimented for the plasma bubbling of milk with respect to raw cow milk sample (control). The plasma bubbling was generated at a voltage (200V), the flow rate of air 10 litres/hour (L/h) and applied to fresh cow milk for 5, 10, and 15 minutes (min) of time interval with 100 mL of the sample volume at room temperature. A significant reduction was observed in coliform and yeast at 200V, 10L/h, 15 min time interval of treatment. The pH of the milk was increased significantly to 6.85 after exposure to plasma bubbling. Whereas, a decreasing value was noticed in total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acid (TA) with respect to time given by the plasma bubbling. Further a nondetrimental effect was observed for the nutrient content of plasma bubbling of milk. The result of the study indicates that plasma bubbling at (200V, 10L/h,100mL,15 min) treatment improves the quality of milk. This study shows that indirect dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) (plasma bubbling) may offer an effective microbial reduction without affecting the quality attributes. The plasma bubbling processing is an initiative for cow raw milk pasteurisation, which could have a future perspective on industrial food applications.",

We provide the first global synthesis of taxonomic and functional distance decay along spatial and environmental distance by analysing 149 datasets comprising different types of organisms and environments. We modelled an exponential distance decay for each dataset using generalized linear models and extracted r2 and slope to analyse the strength and the rate of the decay. We studied whether taxonomic or functional similarity has stronger decay across the spatial and environmental distances. We also unveiled the factors driving the rate of decay across the datasets, including latitude, spatial extent, realm, and organismal features. Taxonomic distance decay was stronger along spatial and environmental distances compared with functional distance decay. The rate of taxonomic spatial distance decay was the fastest in the datasets from mid-latitudes while the rate of functional decay increased with latitude. Overall, datasets covering larger spatial extents showed a lower rate of decay along spatial distances but a higher rate of decay along environmental distances. Marine ecosystems had the slowest rate of decay. This synthesis is an important step towards a more holistic understanding of patterns and drivers of taxonomic and functional {beta}-diversity.",

Here we present a review of the literature based on 77 papers published between 2010 and 2020, in which we assess the current state and recent advances in multispecies connectivity analysis in terrestrial ecosystems. We summarize the four most employed analytical methods, compare their data requirements, and provide an overview of studies comparing results from multiple methods. We explicitly look at approaches for integrating multiple species considerations into reserve design and identify novel approaches being developed to overcome computational and theoretical challenges posed by multispecies connectivity analyses. We conclude that, while advances have been made over the past decade, the field remains nascent in its ability to integrate multiple species interactions into analytical approaches to connectivity. Furthermore, the field is hampered in its ability to provide robust connectivity assessments for lack of a clear definition and goal for multispecies connectivity, as well as a lack of common metrics for their comparison.",

Tools that provide this optimization in an efficient manner for large input data are currently lacking.\n\nHere we present Prider, an R package for designing primers and probes with a nearly optimal coverage for complex and large sequence sets. Prider initially prepares a full primer coverage of the input sequences, the complexity of which is subsequently reduced by removing components of high redundancy or narrow coverage. The primers from the resulting near-optimal coverage are easily accessible as data frames and their coverage across the input sequences can be visualized as heatmaps using Priders plotting function. Prider scales linearly to increasing sequence data and therefore permits efficient design of primers to large and highly diverse DNA datasets.\n\nPrider is available on GitHub under the permissive BSD-3-clause license:\n\nhttps://github.com/manutamminen/prider",

    "preprint_abstract": "Carbon dots (CDs) have been proposed for nucleic acid delivery in many biological applications. In this work we have obtained carbon dots by a hydrothermal synthesis method for developing nanocomposites with dsRNA. These CDs were produced using glucose or saccharose as the nucleation source and passivated with branched polyethyleneimines for conferring positive charges. Hydrodynamic analyses and transmission electron microscopy TEM showed that they sized on average 4 and 5 nm, depending on the sugar. The CDs were fluorescent and showed a peak at 468 nm when excited with UV light. Physicochemical characteristics of their surfaces were revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The {zeta} potential determined that both types of CDs had positive charges as well as good electrophoretic mobility and conductivity. Coating of the CDs to dsRNA was efficient but did not protect from nucleases. DsRNA naked or coated with the CDs were delivered to leaves of cucumber plants by spraying at 2.5 bar. Quantitation of the dsRNA that entered the leaves showed that when coated with the CDs, 50-fold more dsRNA was detected than when naked dsRNA was applied. Moreover, specific siRNAs derived from the sprayed dsRNAs were 130 times more abundant when the dsRNA was coated with the CDs. Systemic dsRNAs were determined in distal leaves showing a dramatic increase in concentration when delivered as a nanocomposite. Similarly, systemic siRNAs were significantly more abundant in distal leaves when spraying with the CD-dsRNA nanocomposite. Furthermore, FITC-labeled dsRNA was shown to accumulate in the apoplast and increase its entry in the plant when coated with CDs. These results indicate that CDs obtained by hydrothermal synthesis are suitable for dsRNA foliar delivery in RNAi plant applications and provide insight into CD-dsRNA translocations.",

While HoxA9 immortalizes cells, cooperation with Meis1 is necessary to induce malignancy. Here, we apply degron techniques to elucidate the leukemogenic contribution of Meis1. ChIP-seq demonstrated that Meis1 localized mainly to H3K27ac and H3K4me1 modified enhancers pre-bound by HoxA9. HoxA9 was epistatic to Meis1 as degradation of HoxA9 caused an immediate release of Meis1 from chromatin. Nascent-RNA sequencing revealed the Meis1 gene expression pattern to be dominated by Myc, ribosome biogenesis and rRNA synthesis. While Myc accounted for cell-cycle stimulation, it could not substitute the leukemogenic effects of Meis1. Enhanced ribosomal biogenesis was accompanied by elevated resistance against RNA polymerase I and translation blocking inhibitors without affecting steady-state protein synthesis. HoxA9 and Meis1 protein stability was controlled by casein kinase 2 (CK2). CK2 inhibition caused rapid degradation of HoxA9 and Meis1 suggesting a potentially exploitable regulatory pathway.",

Its molecular basis is complex and varies geographically across Africa. Here, we used a multi-omics approach, followed-up with functional validation to show that a directionally selected haplotype of a cytochrome P450, CYP9K1 is a major driver of resistance in Anopheles funestus.\n\nA PoolSeq GWAS using mosquitoes alive and dead after permethrin exposure, from Malawi and Cameroon, detected candidate genomic regions, but lacked consistency across replicates. Targeted deep sequencing of candidate resistance genes and genomic loci detected several SNPs associated with known pyrethroid resistance QTLs. The most significant SNP was in the cytochrome P450 CYP304B1 (Cameroon), CYP315A1 (Uganda) and the ABC transporter gene ABCG4 (Malawi). However, when comparing field resistant mosquitoes to laboratory susceptible, the pyrethroid resistance locus rp1 and SNPs around the ABC transporter ABCG4 were consistently significant, except for Uganda where CYP9K1 P450 was markedly significant. In vitro heterologous metabolism assays with recombinant CYP9K1 revealed that it metabolises type II pyrethroid (deltamethrin; 64% depletion) but not type I (permethrin; 0%), while moderately metabolising DDT (17%). CYP9K1 exhibited a drastic reduction of genetic diversity in Uganda, in contrast to other locations, highlighting an extensive selective sweep.

Its molecular basis is complex and varies geographically across Africa. Here, we used several DNA based approach to associate genomic differences between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes from several field and laboratory populations of the malaria vector Anopheles funestus. We followed-up our genomic analyses with functional validation of a candidate resistance gene in East Africa. This gene (CYP9K1) is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene-family that helps to metabolise, and thereby detoxify, pyrethroid insecticides. We show that this gene is a major driver of resistance to a specific sub-class of pyrethroid insecticides only, with moderate to no effects on other insecticides used against Anopheles funestus. We were able to link resistance in this gene to a mutation that changes the amino acid glycine to alanine that may impact how the protein-product of this gene binds to target insecticides. In addition to demonstrating the biochemical specificity of an evolutionary response, we have broadened the available pool of genes can be used to monitor the spread of insecticide resistance in this species.",

To date, models harbouring conditional alleles (i.e.: two loxP sites flanking an exon or a critical DNA sequence of interest) remain the most challenging to generate as they require simultaneous cleavage of the genome using two guides in order to properly integrate the repair template. In the current manuscript, we describe a modification of the sequential electroporation procedure described by Horii et al (2017). We demonstrate production of conditional allele mouse models for eight different genes via one of two alternative strategies: either by consecutive sequential electroporation (strategy A) or non-consecutive sequential electroporation (strategy B).\n\nResultsBy using strategy A, we demonstrated successful generation of conditional allele models for three different genes (Icam1, Lox, and Sar1b), with targeting efficiencies varying between 5 to 13%. By using strategy B, we generated five conditional allele models (Loxl1, Pard6a, Pard6g, Clcf1, and Mapkapk5), with targeting efficiencies varying between 3 to 25%.\n\nConclusionOur modified electroporation-based approach, involving one of the two alternative strategies, allowed the production of conditional allele models for eight different genes via two different possible paths. This reproducible method will serve as another reliable approach in addition to other well-established methodologies in the literature for conditional allele mouse model generation.",

We demonstrate that contrast-sensitivity peaks in the afternoon accompanied by a four-fold increase in the average Shannon information transmitted from an active zone. This increase reflects higher synaptic gain, lower spontaneous \"noise\" and reduced variability of evoked responses. Simultaneously, an increase in the probability of multivesicular events with larger information content increases the efficiency of transmission (bits per vesicle) by factors of 1.5-2.7. This study demonstrates the multiplicity of mechanisms by which a neuromodulator can adjust the synaptic transfer of sensory information.",

Here, we generated new C. elegans models for mitochondriopathies and showed that depletion of Complex I subunits recapitulates biochemical, cellular and neurodevelopmental aspects of the human diseases. Two models, nuo-5/NDUFS1- and lpd-5/NDUFS4-depleted animals, were exploited for a suppressor screening that identified lutein for its ability to rescue animals neurodevelopmental deficits. We uncovered overexpression of synaptic neuroligins as an evolutionarily conserved consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, which we found to mediate an early cholinergic defect in C. elegans. We showed lutein exerts its beneficial effects by restoring neuroligin expression independently from its antioxidant activity, thus pointing to a possible novel pathogenetic target for the human disease.",

Although RNA is a key component of condensation in cells and the central component of the RNA world hypothesis, little is known about what determines RNA accumulation in condensates and how single condensates differ in their RNA composition. Therefore, we developed an approach to read the RNA content from single condensates using high-throughput sequencing. We find that RNAs which are enriched for specific sequence motifs efficiently accumulate in condensates. These motifs show high sequence similarity to short interspersed elements (SINEs). We observed similar results for protein-derived condensates, demonstrating applicability across different in vitro reconstituted membraneless organelles. Thus, our results provide a new inroad to explore the RNA content of phase-separated droplets at single condensate resolution.",

NALCN, FAM155A, UNC79, and UNC80 co-assemble into a large hetero-tetrameric channel complex. Genetic mutations of NALCN channel components lead to neurodevelopmental diseases. However, the structure and mechanism of the intact channel complex remain elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the mammalian NALCN-FAM155A-UNC79-UNC80 quaternary complex. The structure showed that UNC79-UNC80 form a large piler-shaped heterodimer which was tethered to the intracellular side of the NALCN channel through tripartite interactions with the cytoplasmic loops of NALCN. Two interactions are essential for proper cell surface localization of NALCN. The other interaction relieves the self-inhibition of NALCN by pulling the auto-inhibitory CTD Interacting Helix (CIH) out of its binding site.",

Here, using a combination of cryo-EM structure determination, succinate binding and site-directed cysteine alkylation assays, we demonstrate that the VcINDY protein couples sodium- and substrate-binding via a previously unseen induced-fit mechanism. In the absence of sodium, substrate binding is abolished, with the succinate binding regions exhibiting increased flexibility, including HPinb, TM10b and the substrate clamshell motifs. Upon sodium binding, these regions become structurally ordered and create a proper binding site for the substrate.

Furthermore, we observed that scale-dependent effects were present in lower-order, unimodal networks, but not higher-order, transmodal networks.

Such shifts can drive conflicts at the international scale and are highly problematic for the communities and businesses that depend on these living marine resources for income and nutrition. Advances in climate prediction mean that in some regions the state of the ocean, and thereby the drivers of these shifts, can be skilfully forecast up to a decade ahead. However, the potential for these forecasts to benefit ocean-dependent communities has yet to be realised. Here we show for the first time that marine climate predictions can be used to generate decadal-scale forecasts of shifts in the habitat and distribution of marine fish species, as exemplified by Atlantic mackerel, bluefin tuna and blue whiting. We show statistically significant forecast skill of individual years that outperform both persistence and climatological baseline forecasts for lead times of 3-10 years: multi-year averages perform even better, yielding correlation coefficients in excess of 0.90 in some cases. We also show that the habitat shifts underling recent conflicts over Atlantic mackerel fishing rights could have been foreseen on similar timescales. Our results show that climate predictions can be translated into information directly relevant to stakeholders and we anticipate that this tool will be critical in foreseeing, adapting to and coping with the challenges of a changing and variable future climate, particularly in the most ocean-dependent nations and communities.",

To monitor the extent of coastal and marine habitats within protected areas (PAs) in a standardized, open source, and reproducible way, we constructed the Local and the Global Habitat Protection Indexes (LHPI and GHPI, respectively). The LHPI pinpoints the jurisdictions with the greatest opportunity to expand their own PAs, while the GHPI showcases which jurisdictions contribute the most in area to the protection of these habitats globally. Jurisdictions were evaluated to understand which have the highest opportunity to contribute globally to the protection of habitats by meeting a target of 30% coverage of PAs with Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) having the greatest opportunity to do so. While we focus on marine and coastal habitats, our workflow can be extended to terrestrial and freshwater habitats. These indexes are useful to monitor aspects of Sustainable Development Goal 14 and the emerging post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, to understand the current status of international cooperation on coastal and marine habitats conservation.",

Here, we present the use of HR-HRPF-based modeling to determine the structure of the Ig-like domain of NRG1, a protein with no close homolog of known structure. Independent determination of the protein structure by both HR-HRPF-based modeling and heteronuclear NMR was carried out, with results compared only after both processes were complete. The HR-HRPF-based model was highly similar to the lowest energy NMR model, with a backbone RMSD of 1.6 [A].

Along these lines, the regain of wings in stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea) was hypothesised to have occurred several times independently after an ancestral loss, a scenario controversially discussed among evolutionary biologists. Here, we revisit the recovery of wings by reconstructing a phylogeny based on a comprehensive taxon sample of over 500 representative phasmatodean species to infer the evolutionary history of wings. We additionally explored the presence of ocelli, the photoreceptive organs used for flight stabilisation in winged insects, which might provide further information for interpreting flight evolution. Our findings support an ancestral loss of wings and that the ancestors of most major lineages were wingless. While the evolution of ocelli was estimated to be dependent on the presence of (fully-developed) wings, ocelli are nevertheless absent in the majority of all examined winged species and only appear in the members of few subordinate clades, albeit winged and volant taxa are found in every lineage. The disjunct distribution of ocelli substantiates the hypothesis on trait reacquisition and that wings were regained in Phasmatodea.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The Arabidopsis ubiquitin ligases PUB46, PUB47 and PUB48 are encoded by paralogus genes; pub46 and pub48 mutants display increased drought sensitivity compared to wild type (WT). Although the phenotype displayed in the single gene mutants, suggest that each has specific biological activity, PUB46 and PUB48 activity may be also redundant. To test functional redundancy between two gene products requires a double mutant. Unfortunately, the close proximity of the PUB46 and PUB48 gene loci precludes obtaining a double mutant by crossing the available single mutants. We thus applied microRNA technology to reduce the activity of all three gene products of the PUB46-48 subfamily by constructing an artificial microRNA (aMIR) targeted to this subfamily. Expressing aMIR46-48 in WT plants resulted in increased drought-sensitivity, a phenotype resembling that of the single pub46 and pub48 mutants, and enhanced sensitivity to methyl viologen, similar to that observed for the pub46 mutant. Furthermore, the WT plants expressing aMIR46-48 also revealed reduced inhibition by ABA at seed germination, a phenotype not evident in the single mutants. Expressing aMIR46-48 in pub46 and pub48 mutants further enhanced the drought sensitivity of each parental single mutant and of WT expressing aMIR46-48. Thus, whereas the gene-specific activity of the PUB46 and PUB48 E3s is partially redundant in that absence of either E3 leads to drought sensitivity, our ability to eliminate the activity of both PUB46 and PUB48 in the same plant reveals additional gene specific facets of their activity in the reaction to abiotic stress.",

However, current differentiation protocols lack instructions regarding optimal culturing conditions, which hinders the quality of cells and limits scale-up. Here, we introduce a simplified small molecule-based corneal induction method (SSM-CI) to generate corneal epithelial cells from hPSCs. SSM-CI provides the advantage of minimizing cell culturing time using two defined culturing media containing TGF-{beta}, and Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway inhibitors, and bFGF growth factor over 25 days. Compared to the conventional human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE-T) and human primary corneal epithelial cells (hPCEpCs), corneal epithelial cells generated by SSM-CI are well-differentiated and express relevant maturation markers, including PAX6 and CK12. RNA-seq analysis indicated the faithful differentiation of hPSCs into corneal epithelia, with significant upregulation of corneal progenitor and adult corneal epithelial phenotypes. Furthermore, despite the initial inhibition of TGF-{beta} and Wnt/{beta}-catenin, upregulation of these pathway-related transcripts was observed in the later stages, indicating their necessity in the generation of mature corneal epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed a shift in gene signatures associated with the metabolic characteristics of mature corneal epithelial cells, involving a decrease in glycolysis- and an increase in fatty acid oxidation. This was also attributed to the overexpression of metabolic enzymes and transporter-related transcripts responsible for fatty acid metabolism. Thus, SSM-CI provides a comprehensive method for the generation of functional corneal epithelial cells for use in preclinical models.",

    "preprint_abstract": "More than half of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) causing [~]80% of uncomplicated cases. Iron acquisition systems are essential for uropathogenesis, and UPEC encode functionally redundant iron acquisition systems, underlining their importance. However, a recent UPEC clinical isolate, HM7 lacks this functional redundancy and instead encodes a sole siderophore, enterobactin. To determine if E. coli HM7 possesses unidentified iron acquisition systems, we performed RNA-sequencing under iron-limiting conditions and demonstrated that the ferric citrate uptake system (fecABCDE and fecIR) was highly upregulated. Importantly, there are high levels of citrate within urine, some of which is bound to iron, and the fec system is highly enriched in UPEC isolates compared to environmental or fecal strains. Therefore, we hypothesized that HM7 and other similar strains use the fec system to acquire iron in the host. Deletion of both enterobactin biosynthesis and ferric citrate uptake ({Delta}entB/{Delta}fecA) abrogates use of ferric citrate as an iron source and fecA provides an advantage in human urine in absence of enterobactin. However, in a UTI mouse model, fecA is a fitness factor independent of enterobactin production, likely due to the action of host Lipocalin-2 chelating ferrienterobactin. These findings indicate that ferric citrate uptake is used as an iron source when siderophore efficacy is limited, such as in the host during UTI. Defining these novel compensatory mechanisms and understanding the nutritional hierarchy of preferred iron sources within the urinary tract are important in the search for new approaches to combat UTI.\n\nImportanceUPEC, the primary causative agent of uncomplicated UTI is responsible for five billion dollars in healthcare costs in the US each year. Rates of antibiotic resistance are on the rise therefore it is vital to understand the mechanisms of UPEC pathogenesis to uncover potential targets for novel therapeutics. Iron acquisition systems used to obtain iron from sequestered host sources are essential for UPEC survival during UTI and have been used as vaccine targets to prevent infection. This study reveals the ferric citrate uptake system is another important iron acquisition system that is highly enriched in UPEC strains. Ferric citrate uptake has not previously been associated with these pathogenic isolates, underlining the importance of the continued study of these strains to fully understand their mechanisms of pathogenesis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The phytopathogenic proteobacterium Dickeya dadantii secretes an array of plant cell wall degrading enzymes and other virulence factors via the type 2 secretion system (T2SS). T2SSs are widespread among important plant, animal and human bacterial pathogens. This multi-protein complex spans the double membrane cell envelope and secretes fully folded proteins through a large outer membrane pore formed by 15 subunits of the secretin GspD. Secretins are also found in the type 3 secretion system and the type 4 pili. Usually, specialized lipoproteins termed as pilotins assist the targeting and assembly of secretins into the outer membrane. Here, we show that in Dickeya, the pilotin acts in concert with the scaffolding protein GspB. Deletion of gspB profoundly impacts secretin assembly, pectinase secretion, and virulence. Structural studies reveal that GspB possesses a conserved periplasmic Homology Region domain that interacts directly with the N-terminal secretin domain. Site-specific photo cross-linking unravels molecular details of the GspB-GspD complex in vivo. We show that GspB facilitates outer membrane targeting and assembly of the secretin pores and anchors them to the inner membrane while the C-terminal extension of GspB scaffolds the secretin channel in the peptidoglycan cell wall. Phylogenetic analysis shows that in other bacteria, GspB homologs vary in length and domain composition and act in concert with either a cognate ATPase GspA or a pilotin GspS.\n\nImportanceGram-negative bacteria have two cell membranes sandwiching a peptidoglycan net that form together a robust protective cell envelope. To translocate effector proteins across this multilayer envelope, bacteria have evolved several specialized secretion systems. In the type 2 secretion system and some other bacterial machineries, secretins form large multimeric pores that allow transport of effector proteins or filaments across the outer membrane. The secretins are essential for nutrient acquisition and pathogenicity and constitute a target for development of new antibacterials. Targeting of secretin subunits into the outer membrane is often facilitated by a special class of lipoproteins called pilotins. Here, we show that in Dickeya and some other bacteria, the scaffolding protein GspB acts in concert with pilotin, facilitating the assembly of the secretin pore and its anchoring to both the inner membrane and the bacterial cell wall. GspB homologs of varied domain composition are present in many other T2SSs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Introductory biology lessons around the world typically teach that plants absorb water through their roots, but, unfortunately, absorption of water through leaves and subsequent transport and use of this water for biomass formation remains a field limited mostly to specialists. Recent studies have identified foliar water uptake as a significant but still unquantified net water source for terrestrial plants. The growing interest in the development of a new model that includes foliar uptake of liquid water to explain hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in leaf water and tree rings requires a method for distinguishing between these two water sources. I therefore devised a method utilizing two different heavy waters (HDO and H218O) to simultaneously label both foliar-uptake water and root-uptake water and quantify their relative contributions to plant biomass. Using this new method, I here present evidence that, in the case of well-watered Cryptomeria japonica, hydrogen and oxygen incorporated into new leaf cellulose in the rainy season derives mostly from foliar-uptake water, while that of new root cellulose derives mostly from root-uptake water, and new branch xylem is somewhere in between. Abandoning the assumption that these elements are supplied from soil water alone may have vast implications in fields ranging from isotope dendroclimatology, silviculture, to biogeochemistry.",

Here we used two whole-community transplant experiments and a follow-up glasshouse experiment to determine whether the establishment of herbaceous lowland plants in alpine ecosystems influences soil carbon content under warming. We found that warming (transplantation to low elevation) led to a negligible decrease in alpine soil carbon content, but its effects became significant and 52% {+/-} 31% (mean {+/-} 95% CIs) larger after lowland plants were introduced at low density into the ecosystem. We present evidence that decreases in soil carbon content likely occurred via lowland plants increasing rates of root exudation, soil microbial respiration and CO2 release under warming.

Here, we study the resistome of 771 samples from five major body parts (skin, nares, vagina, gut and oral cavity) of healthy subjects from the Human Microbiome Project and addressed the potential dispersion of ARGs in pristine environments. A total of 28,731 ARGs belonging to 344 different ARG types were found in the HMP proteome dataset (n=9.1x107 proteins analyzed). Our study reveals a distinct resistome profile (ARG type and abundance) between body sites and high inter-individual variability. Nares had the highest ARG load ({approx}5.4 genes/genome) followed by the oral cavity, while the gut showed one of the highest ARG richness (shared with nares) but the lowest abundance ({approx}1.3 genes/genome). Fluroquinolone resistance genes were the most abundant in the human body, followed by macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) or tetracycline. Most of the ARGs belonged to common bacterial commensals and multidrug resistance trait was predominant in the nares and vagina. Our data also provide hope, since the spread of common ARG from the human body to pristine environments (n=271 samples; 77 Gb of sequencing data and 2.1x108 proteins analyzed) thus far remains very unlikely (only one case found in an autochthonous bacterium from a pristine environment). These findings broaden our understanding of ARG in the context of the human microbiome and the One-Health Initiative of WHO uniting human host-microbes and environments as a whole.\n\nImportanceThe current antibiotic resistance crisis affects our health and wealth at a global scale and by 2050 predictions estimate 10 million deaths attributed to antibiotic resistance worldwide. Remarkably, a comprehensive analysis of ARG diversity and prevalence in different human body sites is yet to be done. Undoubtedly, our body and human built-environment have antibiotic resistant bacteria than can also be transported to other environments. Hence, the analysis of Human Microbiome Project dataset provides us not only the opportunity to explore in detail the ARGs diversity and prevalence in different parts of our body but also to provide some insights into the dispersion of ARGs from human to natural populations inhabiting pristine environments. Thus, our data would help to stablish a baseline in ARG surveillance protocols to asses further changes in antibiotic resistances in our society.",

Here we hypothesize that the codes mediating neuronal communication in HPC and LPFC microcircuits have distinctively evolved to serve plasticity and memory function at different spatiotemporal scales. We used a virtual reality task in which animals navigated through a maze using a joystick and selected one of two targets in the arms of the maze according to a learned context-color rule. We found that neurons and neuronal populations in both regions encode similar information about the task. Moreover, we demonstrate that many HPC neurons concentrate spikes into bursts, whereas most layer II/III LPFC neurons sparsely distribute spikes over time. As the animals learned the task HPC neurons, but not LPFC neurons, increased their burst rate as a function of performance. When integrating spike rates over short intervals, HPC neuronal ensembles reached maximum decoded information with fewer neurons than LPFC ensembles. Our results show that during associative learning HPC principal cells concentrate spikes in bursts enabling temporal summation and fast synaptic plasticity in small populations of neurons and ultimately facilitating rapid encoding of associative memories. On the other hand, layers II/III LPFC pyramidal cells fire spikes more sparsely distributed in time and over a larger number of neurons. The latter would facilitate broadcasting of signals loaded in short term memory across neuronal populations without necessarily triggering fast synaptic plasticity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Memory consolidation, the transformation of labile memory traces into stable long-term representations, is facilitated by post-learning sleep. Computational and biophysical models suggest that sleep spindles may play a key mechanistic role for consolidation, igniting structural changes at cortical sites involved in prior learning. Here we tested the resulting prediction that spindles are most pronounced over learning-related cortical areas and that the extent of this learning-spindle overlap predicts behavioural measures of memory consolidation. Using high-density scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) and Polysomnography (PSG) in healthy volunteers, we first identified cortical areas engaged during a temporospatial associative memory task (power decreases in the alpha/beta frequency range, 6-20 Hz). Critically, we found that participant-specific topographies (i.e., spatial distributions) of post-learning sleep spindle amplitude correlated with participant-specific learning topographies. Importantly, the extent to which spindles tracked learning patterns further predicted memory consolidation across participants. Our results provide empirical evidence for a role of post-learning sleep spindles in tracking learning networks, thereby facilitating memory consolidation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Autism is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by substantial phenotypic heterogeneity, which hinders diagnosis, research, and intervention. A leading example can be found in marked imbalances in language and perceptual skills, where deficits in one domain often co-exist with normal or even superior performance in the other domain. The current work capitalized on multiple data analytics including data-driven subtyping and dimensional approaches to quantify cognitive imbalances in multi-site datasets of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical controls, and assessed structural and functional brain network substrates. Studying cognitive dimensions as well as multimodal neuroimaging signatures in 155 ASD and 151 neurotypical individuals, we observed robust evidence for a structure-function substrate of cognitive imbalances in ASD. Specifically, ASD presented with marked imbalances in cognitive profiles relative to neurotypical controls, characterized by verbal to non-verbal intelligence discrepancy. Different analytical approaches including subtyping and dimensional regression methods converged in showing that these imbalances were reflected in atypical cortical thickening and functional integration of language networks, alongside with sensory and higher cognitive networks. Phenotypic findings could be replicated in an independent sample of 325 ASD and 569 neurotypical controls. Although verbal and non-verbal intelligence are currently considered as specifiers unrelated to the categorical diagnosis of autism, our results show that intelligence disparities are accentuated in ASD and relate to a consistent structure-function substrate affecting multiple brain networks. Our findings motivate the incorporation of cognitive imbalances in future autism research, which may help to parse the phenotypic heterogeneity of autism and potentially inform intervention-oriented subtyping.",

However, studies on a wider range of metabolites in exudates are required for a comprehensive understanding about their influence on microbial communities. We identified maize inbred lines that differ in exudate concentrations of DIMBOA and GABA using a semi-hydroponic system. These lines were grown in the field to determine the changes in microbial diversity and gene expression due to varying concentrations of DIMBOA and GABA in exudates using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metatranscriptomics. Results showed individual and interaction effects of DIMBOA and GABA on the rhizosphere and root endosphere {beta}-diversity, most strongly at the V10 growth stage. The main bacterial families affected by both compounds were Ktedonobacteraceae and Xanthomonadaceae. Higher concentrations of DIMBOA in exudates affected the rhizosphere metatranscriptome, enriching for KEGG pathways associated with plant disease. This study validated the use of natural variation within plant species as a powerful approach for understanding the role of root exudates on microbiome selection. We also showed that a semi-hydroponic system can be used to identify maize genotypes that differ in GABA and DIMBOA exudate concentrations under field conditions. The impact of GABA exudation on root-associated microbiomes was shown for the first time.",

Nonetheless, a significant portion of patients receiving the therapy experience poor outcomes in the acute response for unknown reasons. Given the decreased expansion and persistence of CD8 CAR-T cells in poor outcome groups, this failure may be attributed to CAR-T cell dysfunction. However, a comparison of the post-infusion transcriptional profiles and phenotypes between CAR-T cells of poor and favorable response groups has not been performed. Here, we employed single cell RNA sequencing and protein surface marker profiling of serial CAR-T cell blood samples from patients with CD19+ relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) to reveal CAR-T cell evolution, identify biomarkers of response, and test for evidence of exhaustion in CAR-T cells of poor responders. At the transcriptional and protein levels, we note the evolution of a majority of CAR-T cells toward a non-proliferative and highly-differentiated state. In poor outcome patients, we observed a more marked enrichment of an exhaustion profile as compared to favorable outcome patients. Lastly, we identified the checkpoint receptor TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential driver of CAR-T cell exhaustion. Altogether, we provide evidence of CAR-T cell dysfunction marked by TIGIT expression driving poor response in NHL patients.",

Here, we examined concentrations of nanoparticles and lipids in xylem sap and contamination control samples of six temperate angiosperm species with a NanoSight device and based on mass spectrometry. We found (1) that the concentration of nanoparticles and lipids were both diluted when an increasing amount of sap was extracted, (2) that their concentrations were significantly correlated in three species, (3) that their concentrations were affected by vessel anatomy, and (4) that concentrations of nanoparticles and lipids were very low in contamination-control samples. Moreover, there was little seasonal difference, no freezing-thawing effect on nanoparticles, and little seasonal variation in lipid composition. These findings indicate that lipids and nanoparticles are related to each other, and largely do not pass interconduit pit membranes.

This approach allowed for characterization of excitatory and inhibitory populations across an extended peritumoral cortical region. As expected, measures of excitability were increased in tumor-bearing slices compared to control. This was accompanied by marked functional alterations in single units classified as fast-spiking interneurons, including reduced firing, altered timing with respect to excitatory firing, and deficits in surround inhibition. Inhibiting mTOR with AZD8055 reversed these glioma-induced changes to excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, suggesting a prominent role for functional mechanisms linked to mTOR activation.",

RNA binding proteins (RBP) are needed for this and other aspects of post-transcriptional control of localized mRNAs, but only a limited number of axonal RBPs have been reported. We used a targeted mass spectrometry approach to profile the axonal RBPs in naive, injured and regenerating PNS axons. We detected 76 axonal proteins that are reported to have RNA binding activity, with the levels of several of these axonal RBPs changing with axonal injury and regeneration. These axonal RBPs with altered axoplasm levels include KHSRP that we previously reported decreases neurite outgrowth in developing CNS neurons. We show that KHSRP levels rapidly increase in sciatic nerve axons after crush injury and remain elevated increasing in levels out to 28 days post-sciatic nerve crush injury. Khsrp mRNA localizes into axons and the rapid increase in axonal KHSRP after axotomy is mediated by the local translation of its mRNA. KHSRP binds to mRNAs with a 3UTR AU-rich element and targets those mRNAs to the cytoplasmic exosome for degradation. KHSRP knockout mice show increased axonal levels of defined KHSRP target mRNAs, Gap43 and Snap25 mRNAs, following sciatic nerve injury and accelerated nerve regeneration in vivo. These data indicate that axonal translation of Khsrp mRNA following nerve injury serves to destabilize other axonal mRNAs and slow axon regeneration.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The mammalian pocket protein family, which includes the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and Rb-like pocket proteins p107 and p130, regulates entry into and exit from the cell cycle by repressing cell cycle gene expression. Although pRb plays a dominant role in mammalian systems, p107 and p130 are the ancestral pocket proteins. The Rb-like pocket proteins interact with the highly conserved 5-subunit MuvB complex and an E2F-DP transcription factor heterodimer, forming the DREAM (for Dp, Rb-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex. DREAM complex assembly on chromatin culminates in repression of target genes mediated by the MuvB subcomplex. Here, we examined how the Rb-like pocket protein contributes to DREAM formation and function by disrupting the interaction between the sole Caenorhabditis elegans pocket protein LIN-35 and the MuvB subunit LIN-52 using CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis. A triple alanine substitution of LIN-52s LxCxE motif severed LIN-35-MuvB association and caused classical DREAM mutant phenotypes, including synthetic multiple vulvae, high-temperature arrest, and ectopic expression of germline genes in the soma. However, RNA-seq revealed limited upregulation of DREAM target genes when LIN-35-MuvB association was severed, as compared to gene upregulation following LIN-35 loss. Based on chromatin immunoprecipitation, disrupting LIN-35-MuvB association did not affect the chromatin localization of E2F-DP, LIN-35, or MuvB components. In a previous study we showed that in worms lacking LIN-35, E2F-DP and MuvB chromatin occupancy was reduced genome-wide. With LIN-35 present but unable to associate with MuvB, our present study suggests that the E2F-DP-LIN-35 interaction promotes E2F-DPs chromatin localization, which we hypothesize supports MuvB chromatin occupancy indirectly through DNA. Altogether, this study highlights how the pocket proteins association with MuvB supports DREAM function but is not required for DREAMs chromatin occupancy.",

This system, which starts with six equipotent cells, encompasses diverse types of developmental event, including developmental competence, multiple signaling events to control precise and faithful patterning of three cell fates, execution and proliferation of specific cell lineages, and a series of sophisticated morphogenetic events. Early events have been subjected to extensive mutational and genetic investigations and later events to cell biological analyses. We infer the existence of dramatically changing profiles of gene expression that accompanies the observed changes in development. Yet except from serendipitous discovery of several transcription factors expressed in dynamic patterns in vulval lineages, our knowledge of the transcriptomic landscape during vulval development is minimal. This study describes the composition of a vulva-specific transcriptome. We used tissue specific harvesting of mRNAs via immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged poly(A) binding protein, PAB-1, heterologously expressed by a promoter known to express GFP in vulval cells throughout their development. The identified transcriptome was small but tightly interconnected. From this data set we identified several genes with identified functions in development of the vulva and validated more with promoter-GFP reporters of expression. For one target, lag-1, promoter-GFP expression was limited but fluorescent tag of the endogenous protein revealed extensive expression. Thus, we have identified a transcriptome of the C. elegans as a launching pad for exploration of functions of these genes in organogenesis.",

The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a micropredator that first detects humans at a distance through sensory cues such as carbon dioxide. As a mosquito nears its target it senses more proximal cues such as body heat that guides it to a meal of blood. How long the search for blood continues after initial detection of a human is not known. Here we show that a 5-second optogenetic pulse of fictive carbon dioxide induced a persistent behavioral state in female mosquitoes that lasted for more than 10 minutes. This state is highly specific to females searching for a blood meal and was not induced in recently blood-fed females or in males, who do not feed on blood. In males that lack the gene fruitless, which controls persistent social behaviors in other insects, fictive carbon dioxide induced a long-lasting behavior response resembling the predatory state of females. Finally, we show that the persistent state triggered by detection of fictive carbon dioxide enabled females to engorge on a blood meal mimic offered up to 14 minutes after the initial 5-second stimulus. Our results demonstrate that a persistent internal state allows female mosquitoes to integrate multiple human sensory cues over long timescales, an ability that is key to their success as an apex micropredator of humans.",

In doing so, it helps to maintain proteostasis in mitochondria. How ATAD1 tackles the energetic challenge to extract hydrophobic membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and what structural features adapt ATAD1 for its particular function has remained a mystery. Previously, we determined the structure of Msp1 in complex with a peptide substrate (Wang et al., 2020). The structure showed that Msp1s mechanism follows the general principle established for AAA proteins while adopting several structural features that specialize it for its function. We used the yeast growth assay to test the function of key amino acids within these structural elements. In this work, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the human ATAD1 in complex with a peptide substrate at near atomic resolution. The structures show that phylogenetically conserved structural elements adapt ATAD1 for its function while generally adopting a conserved mechanism shared by many AAA proteins. ATAD1s distinguishing features include an abundance of aromatic amino acids that line the central pore proposed to give ATAD1 a firm grip on its substrate and a short -helix at the C-terminus that strongly facilitates ATAD1s oligomerization. We also developed a microscopy-based assay reporting on protein mislocalization, with which we directly assessed ATAD1s activity in live cells.",

MMc was measured in whole blood from 58 infants using a panel of quantitative PCR assays at day one and 7, 15, and 36 weeks of life. Infants received BCG at birth, and selected whole blood samples from infancy were stimulated in vitro with BCG and assessed for polyfunctional CD4+ T cell responses. MMc was present in most infants across infancy with levels ranging from 0-1,193/100,000 genomic equivalents and was positively impacted by absence of maternal HIV, maternal-infant HLA compatibility, infant female sex, and exclusive breastfeeding. Initiation of maternal antiretroviral therapy prior to pregnancy partially restored MMc level in HIV exposed, uninfected infants. Birth MMc was associated with an improved polyfunctional CD4+ T cell response to BCG. These data emphasize that both maternal and infant factors influence the level of MMc, which may subsequently impact infant T cell responses.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "preprint_abstract": "Proteoglycans are heterogeneous macromolecular glycoconjugates that orchestrate many important cellular processes. While much attention has focused on the poly-sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains that decorate proteoglycans, other important elements of proteoglycan architecture, such as their core proteins and cell surface localization, have garnered less emphasis. Hence, comprehensive structure-function relationships that consider the replete proteoglycan architecture as glycoconjugates are limited. Here, we present a comprehensive approach to study proteoglycan structure and biology by fabricating defined semi-synthetic modular proteoglycans that can be tailored for cell surface display. To do so, we integrate amber codon reassignment in the expression of sequence-fined proteoglycan core proteins, metabolic oligosaccharide engineering to produce functionalizable glycosaminoglycans, and bioorthogonal click chemistry to covalently tether the two components. These materials permit the methodical dissection of the parameters required for optimal binding and function of various proteoglycan-binding proteins, and they can be modularly displayed on the surface of any living cell. We demonstrate that these sophisticated materials can recapitulate the functions of native proteoglycans in mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and cancer cell spreading, while permitting the identification of the most important contributing elements of proteoglycan architecture toward function. This technology platform will confer structural resolution toward the investigation of proteoglycan structure-function relationships in cell biology.",

Indisulam is an abandoned drug that acts as a molecular glue, inducing degradation of splicing factor RBM39 through interaction with CRL4DCAF15. Here, we performed genetic and compound screens to uncover factors mediating indisulam sensitivity and resistance. First, a dropout CRISPR screen identified SRPK1 loss as a synthetic lethal interaction with indisulam that can be exploited therapeutically by the SRPK1 inhibitor SPHINX31. Moreover, a CRISPR resistance screen identified components of the degradation complex that mediate resistance to indisulam: DCAF15, DDA1, and CAND1. Lastly, we show that cancer cells readily acquire spontaneous resistance to indisulam. Upon acquiring indisulam resistance, pancreatic cancer (Panc10.05) cells still degrade RBM39 and are vulnerable to BCL-xL inhibition. The better understanding of the factors that influence the response to indisulam can assist rational reuse of this drug in the clinic.",

Here we use Mycobacterium marinum infection of zebrafish embryos and Mycobacterium tuberculosis of human THP-1 cells to demonstrate that pathogenic mycobacteria upregulate the host WNK signalling pathway kinases SPAK and OXSR1 which control intracellular potassium balance. We show that genetic depletion or inhibition of OXSR1 decreases bacterial burden and intracellular potassium levels. The protective effects of OXSR1 depletion are mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and are dependent on caspase-mediated release of IL-1{beta} and the downstream activation of protective TNF-.

Through quantitative experiments, we show that ppGpp responds inversely to the rate of translational elongation in E. coli. Together with its roles in inhibiting ribosome biogenesis and activity, ppGpp closes a key regulatory circuit that enables the cell to perceive and control the rate of its growth across conditions. The celebrated linear growth law relating the ribosome content and growth rate emerges as a consequence of keeping a supply of ribosome reserves while maintaining elongation rate in slow growth conditions. Further analysis suggests the elongation rate itself is detected by sensing the ratio of dwelling and translocating ribosomes, a strategy employed to collapse the complex, high-dimensional dynamics of the molecular processes underlying cell growth to perceive the physiological state of the whole.",

Elucidation of the environmental factors that affect parasite transmission by vectors is essential to develop sustainable methods of parasite control that do not have off-target effects on beneficial insects or environmental health. Many phytochemicals that inhibit growth of sand fly-vectored Leishmania--which have been exhaustively studied in the search for phytochemical-based drugs--are abundant in nectar, which provide sugar-based meals to infected sand flies. In a quantitative meta-analysis, we compare inhibitory phytochemical concentrations for Leishmania to concentrations present in floral nectar and pollen. We show that nectar concentrations of several flowering plant species exceed those that inhibit growth of Leishmania cell cultures, suggesting an unexplored, landscape ecology-based approach to reduce Leishmania transmission. Strategic planting of antiparasitic phytochemical-rich floral resources or phytochemically enriched baits could reduce Leishmania loads in vectors, providing an environmentally friendly complement to existing means of disease control.",

All four methods had comparable rates of detection failure, though A-MUD outperformed the others in terms of true positive rates for recordings with low or high signal-to-noise ratios. We also did a systematic comparison of existing classification algorithms, where we found the need to develop a new method for automating the classification of USVs using supervised classification, bootstrapping on Gammatone Spectrograms, and Convolutional Neural Networks algorithms with Snapshot ensemble learning (BootSnap).

Early development was analyzed via a series of montages and images documenting embryos collected from the brood pouches of pregnant males. Despite differences in terminal morphology between pipefish and common teleost models such as medaka and zebrafish, the embryogenesis of these highly advanced fishes is generally similar to that of other fishes. One of the unique features of these fishes is their utilization of an aglomerular kidney. Histological analysis revealed a single long, unbranched kidney tubule in late embryos. The development and structure of this organ was further investigated by cloning the sodium potassium ATPase alpha subunit, atp1a, from S. leptorhynchus and developing whole mount fluorescent in situ hybridization protocols for embryos of this species. Fluorescent stereoscopic and confocal visualization techniques were then used to characterize the 3D morphology of aglomerular kidneys in intact embryos. In all embryonic stages characterized, the aglomerular kidney is a single unbranched tube extending from just behind the head to the cloaca.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe flow of physiologic fluids through organs and organs systems is an integral component of their function. The complex fluid dynamics in many organ systems are still not completely understood, and in-vivo measurements of flow rates and pressure provide a testament to the complexity of each flow system. Variability in in-vivo measurements and the lack of control over flow characteristics leave a lot to be desired for testing and evaluation of current modes of treatments as well as future innovations. In-vitro models are particularly ideal for studying neurological conditions such as hydrocephalus due to their complex pathophysiology and interactions with therapeutic measures. The following aims to present the reciprocating positive displacement pump, capable of inducing pulsating flow of a defined volume at a controlled beat rate and amplitude. While the other fluidic applications of the pump are currently under investigation, this study was focused on simulating the pulsating cerebrospinal fluid production across profiles with varying parameters.\n\nMethodsPumps were manufactured using 3D printed and injection molded parts. The pumps were powered by an Arduino-based board and proprietary software that controls the linear motion of the pumps to achieve the specified output rate at the desired pulsation rate and amplitude. A range of [Formula] to [Formula] was tested to evaluate the versatility of the pumps. The accuracy and precision of the pumps output were evaluated by obtaining a total of 150 one-minute weight measurements of degassed deionized water per output rate across 15 pump channels. In addition, nine experiments were performed to evaluate the pumps control over pulsation rate and amplitude.\n\nResultsvolumetric analysis of a total of 1200 readings determined that the pumps achieved the target output volume rate with a mean absolute error of -0.001034283 [Formula] across the specified domain. It was also determined that the pumps can maintain pulsatile flow at a user-specified beat rate and amplitude.\n\nConclusionThe validation of this reciprocating positive displacement pump system allows for the future validation of novel designs to components used to treat hydrocephalus and other physiologic models involving pulsatile flow. Based on the promising results of these experiments at simulating pulsatile CSF flow, a benchtop model of human CSF production and distribution could be achieved through the incorporation of a chamber system and a compliance component.",

We find significant increases in the in vivo degradation rate for specific molecular chaperones, nitrate reductase, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase and other plastid, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and cytosolic enzymes involved in redox shuttles. Coupled analysis of protein degradation rates, mRNA levels, and protein abundance reveal that 57% of the nuclear-encoded enzymes with higher degradation rates also had high light-induced transcriptional responses to maintain proteostasis. In contrast, plastid-encoded proteins with enhanced degradation rates showed decreased transcript abundances and must maintain protein abundance by other processes. This analysis reveals a light-induced transcriptional program for nuclear-encoded genes, beyond the regulation of PSII D1 subunit and the function of PSII, to replace key protein degradation targets in plants and ensure proteostasis under high light stress.",

    "preprint_abstract": "To import large metabolites across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, TonB dependent transporters (TBDTs) undergo significant conformational change. After substrate binding in BtuB, the E. coli vitamin B12 TBDT, TonB binds and couples BtuB to the inner membrane proton motive force that powers transport (1). But, the role of TonB in rearranging the plug domain to form a putative pore remains enigmatic. Some studies focus on force-mediated unfolding (2) while others propose force-independent pore formation (3) by TonB binding leading to breakage of a salt bridge termed the \"Ionic Lock\". Our hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry measurements in E. coli outer membranes find that the region surrounding the Ionic Lock, far from the B12 site, is fully destabilized upon substrate binding. A comparison of the exchange between the B12 bound and the B12&TonB bound complexes indicates that B12 binding is sufficient to unfold the Ionic Lock region with the subsequent binding of a TonB fragment having much weaker effects. TonB binding accelerates exchange in the third substrate binding loop, but pore formation does not obviously occur in this or any region. This study provides a detailed structural and energetic description of the early stages of B12 passage that provides support both for and against current models of the transport process.\n\nSignificance StatementTonB dependent transporters such as BtuB are found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. They import scarce nutrients essential for growth, such as B12, the substrate of BtuB. Many transport steps remain enigmatic. Recent studies have emphasized force-mediated unfolding or the breakage of the \"Ionic Lock\", a moiety far from the B12 binding site. A strong dependence on the membrane environment has been noted. Accordingly, we measured hydrogen exchange on BtuB still embedded in native outer membranes and found that B12 binding is sufficient to break the Ionic Lock. The amino terminus then extends into the periplasm to bind TonB. But we find no evidence of pore formation, which likely requires energy transduction from the inner membrane by TonB.",

Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation act as mediators in the interaction between steroid hormones and the genome. Variations in the epigenome could be important in determining morphological or behavior differences among individuals of the same species. In this study, we explored DNA methylation differences in the hypothalamus of male oriented rams (MORs) and female oriented rams (FORs). We employed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to generate a genome-wide map of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptome. We found substantial DNA methylation and gene expression differences between FORs and MORs. Although none of the differentially methylated genes yielded significant functional terms directly associated with sex development, three differentially expressed genes were identified that have been associated previously with sexual behaviors. We hypothesize that these differences are involved in the phenotypic variation in ram sexual partner preferences, whereas future studies will have to find the specific mechanisms. Our results add an intriguing new dimension to sheep behavior that should be useful for further understanding epigenetic and transcriptomic involvement.",

The aim of the current study was to generate transgenic tomato plants expressing the TYLCV C4 gene and evaluate differential gene expression through comparative transcriptome analysis between the transgenic C4 plants and the transgenic green fluorescent protein (Gfp) gene control plants. Transgenic tomato plants expressing the TYLCV C4 developed phenotypes, including leaf upward cupping and yellowing that are similar the disease symptom expressed on tomato plants infected with TYLCV. In a total of 241 differentially expressed genes identified in the transcriptome analysis, a series of plant development-related genes, including transcription factors, glutaredoxins, protein kinases, R-genes and microRNA target genes, were significantly altered. These results provide further evidence to support the important function of the C4 protein in begomovirus pathogenicity. These transgenic tomato plants could serve as basic genetic materials for further characterization of plant receptors that are interacting with the TYLCV C4.",

    "preprint_abstract": "A short non-coding sequence present between the gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) and gamma-glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5) genes, termed a spacer sequence has been detected in the genomes of Mus musculus, the house mouse and in Philippine tarsier, a primitive ancestral primate. It is highly conserved during primate evolution with certain sequences being totally invariant from mouse to humans. Evidence is presented to show this intergenic sequence serves as a nucleation site for the initiation of diverse genes. We also outline the birth of the human lincRNA gene BCRP3 (BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase 3 pseudogene) during primate evolution. The gene developmental process involves sequence initiation, addition of a complex of tandem transposable elements and addition of a segment of another gene. The sequence, initially formed in the Old World Monkeys such as the Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and the baboon (Papio anubis), develops into different primate genes before evolving into the human BCRP3 gene; it appears to also include trial and error during sequence/gene formation. The protein gene, GGT5 may have also formed by spacer sequence initiation in an ancient ancestor such as zebrafish, but spacer and GGT5 gene sequence drift during evolution produced a divergence that precludes further assessment.\n\nAuthor summaryFor a number of decades researchers have been interested in how genes evolve and a number of mechanisms of gene formation have been defined. This manuscript describes a different process of gene formation, that of a small DNA sequence that does not code for a gene but serves as a nucleation site for the initiation of de novo gene formation. This non-coding DNA sequence appears to have been in existence for about hundred million years or more and has formed the basis for the birth of diverse genes during evolution of the primates. The questions of how and why new genes are born are important in terms of revealing how organisms, especially primates, progress to greater complexity during evolution; the question of \"how\" is particularly relevant to the creation of biological information ab initio during prebiotic and early cellular evolution.",

However, these studies have focused on one or a few organs and were thus limited in understanding the developing immune system as a distributed network across tissues. Here, we profiled prenatal haematopoietic organs, lymphoid organs and non-lymphoid tissues using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, paired antigen-receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reconstruct the developing human immune system. Our analysis revealed the acquisition of immune effector transcriptome profiles in macrophages, mast cells and NK cells from the second trimester, and the transcriptomic changes accompanying the late-stage maturation of developing monocytes and T cells that extended from their organ of origin to peripheral tissues. We uncovered system-wide blood and immune cell development beyond the conventional primary haematopoietic organs. We further identified, extensively characterised and functionally validated the human prenatal B1 cells. Finally, we provide evidence for thymocyte-thymocyte selection origin for {beta}TCR- expressing unconventional T cells based on TCR gene usage and an in vitro artificial thymic organoid culture model. Our comprehensive atlas of the developing human immune system provides both valuable data resources and biological insights that will facilitate cell engineering, regenerative medicine and disease understanding.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryBy performing a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing atlas of human developing immune system together with antigen-receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we explored the cross-gestation and cross-organ variability in immune cells, discovered system-wide blood and immune cell development, identified, characterised and functionally validated the properties of human prenatal B1 cells and the origin of unconventional T cells.",

    "preprint_abstract": "AimWaterbirds are important dispersal vectors of multicellular organisms such as macrophytes, aquatic macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton. However, no study to date has focused on their potential role in dispersing aquatic microbial communities (i.a., bacteria, algae, protozoa). Here, we explicitly studied passive transport (endozoochory) of prokaryotes and unicellular microeukaryotes by waterbirds based on DNA metabarcoding approaches. By directly comparing the dispersed set of organisms to the source pool of a natural metacommunity, we aimed for a realistic estimate of the overall importance of waterbird zoochory for natural microbial communities.\n\nLocationShallow saline temporary ponds (soda pans) in the cross-border region of Austria and Hungary.\n\nTaxonProkaryotes and unicellular microeukaryotes.\n\nMethodsIn 2017 and 2018, water samples from 25 natural aquatic habitats along with fresh droppings of the dominant greylag goose (Anser anser) and four other waterbird species were collected in a habitat network of temporary ponds. Their prokaryotic and microeukaryotic communities were identified via 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sequence reads were analysed using mothur. After quality filtering of the reads, pro- and microeukaryotic amplicon sequencing variant (ASV) compositions were compared between the aquatic and dropping samples, across years and waterbird species.\n\nResultsWe found that 28% of the dominant aquatic prokaryotic and 19% of the microeukaryotic ASVs were transported by A. anser. ASV richness in A. anser droppings was lower, but compositional variation was higher compared to the aquatic communities, probably resulting from stochastic pick-up of microbes from multiple aquatic habitats. We furthermore found that the composition of prokaryotic ASVs in bird droppings were different among the two years and reflected the actual aquatic communities. The dispersed set of microbes were largely similar among the different waterbird species except for the planktivore filter-feeder northern shoveler (Spatula clypeata) which was outstanding by dispersing a more species-rich subset of microeukaryotes than shorebirds or geese.\n\nMain conclusionsBy using a combined amplicon-sequencing approach to characterize microorganisms in waterbird droppings and in the associated environment, our study provides strong evidence for endozoochory of natural aquatic microorganism communities. These results imply that waterbirds may be crucial in maintaining ecological connectivity between discrete aquatic habitats at the level of microbial communities.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is finding increased application in biological fields. While realizing a complex UKF system in a low-power embedded platform offers many potential benefits including wearability, it also poses significant design challenges. Here we present a method for optimizing a UKF system for realization in an embedded platform. The method seeks to minimize both computation time and error in UKF state reconstruction and forecasting. As a case study, we applied the method to a model for the rat sleep-wake regulatory system in which 432 variants of the UKF over six different variables are considered. The optimization method is divided into three stages that assess computation time, state forecast error, and state reconstruction error. We apply a cost function to variants that pass all three stages to identify a variant that computes 27 times faster than the reference variant and maintains required levels of state estimation and forecasting accuracy. We draw the following insights: 1) process noise provides leeway for simplifying the model and its integration in ways that speed computation time while maintaining state forecasting accuracy, 2) the assimilation of observed data during the UKF correction step provides leeway for simplifying the UKF structure in ways that speed computation time while maintaining state reconstruction accuracy, and 3) the optimization process can be accelerated by decoupling variables that directly impact the underlying model from variables that impact the UKF structure.\n\nAuthor summaryPowerful statistical tools can be used to estimate unmeasured information in biological systems and predict the systems future state. Translating these tools from a desktop computer to small, wearable or implantable platforms can unlock many benefits, but presents many design challenges, because tradeoffs between computational simplicity and system accuracy must be balanced. We present an approach to translating one such widely used statistical tool, the unscented Kalman filter, from a desktop computer to a miniature device. We demonstrate the approach with a case study centering on the neural circuits governing the mammalian sleep-wake cycle. By exploiting uncertainty in the biology being estimated and the corrective influence of biological measurements, we arrive at a design that is easily computable on the miniature device and maintains a high level of accuracy. We anticipate that our approach will aid others in designing such miniaturized systems for a broad range of applications.",

Despite high vaccine coverage, pertussis has re-emerged in many countries and caused two large epidemics in Australia since 2007. Here, we undertook a genomic and phylogeographic study of 385 Australian B. pertussis isolates collected from 2008 to 2017. The Australian B. pertussis population was found to be composed of mostly ptxP3 strains carrying different fim3 alleles, with ptxP3-fim3A genotype expanded far more than ptxP3-fim3B. Within the former, there were six co-circulating epidemic lineages (EL1 to EL6). The multiple ELs emerged, expanded, and then declined at different time points over the two epidemics, likely driven by immune selection from pertussis vaccination and natural infection in addition to local and global transmission events. Both hard and soft selective sweeps through vaccine selection pressures determined the current B. pertussis population dynamics. Relative risk analysis found that once a new B. pertussis lineage emerged, it was more likely to spread locally within the first 1.5 years. However, after 1.5 years, any new lineage was likely to expand to a wider region and became no longer spatially structured across the country. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the expansion of ptxP3 strains was also associated with replacement of the type III secretion system allele bscI1 with bscI3. This study advanced our understanding of the epidemic population structure and spatial and temporal dynamics of B. pertussis in a highly immunised population.",

OOC approaches tailored for cardiac tissue engineering resulted in a variety of platforms, some of which integrate stimulation or probing capabilities. Due to manual handling processes, however, a large-scale standardized and robust tissue generation, applicable in an industrial setting, is still out of reach. Here, we present a novel cell injection and tissue generation concept relying on spheroids, which can be produced in large quantities and uniform size from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cardiomyocytes. Hydrostatic flow transports and accumulates spheroids in dogbone-shaped cultivation chambers, which subsequently fuse and form aligned, contracting cardiac muscle fibers. Furthermore, we demonstrate electrical stimulation capabilities by utilizing fluidic media connectors as electrodes and provide the blueprint of a low-cost, open-source, scriptable pulse generator. We report on a novel integration strategy of optical O2 sensor spots into resin-based microfluidic systems, enabling in situ determination of O2 partial pressures. Finally, proof-of-concept demonstrating electrical stimulation combined with in situ monitoring of metabolic activity in cardiac tissues is provided. The developed system thus opens the door for advanced OOCs integrating biophysical stimulation as well as probing capabilities and serves as blueprint for the facile and robust generation of high density microtissues in microfluidic modules amenable for scale-up and automation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "As neurons age, protein homeostasis becomes less efficient, resulting in misfolding and aggregation. Chaperone proteins perform vital functions in the maintenance of cellular proteostasis, and chaperone-based therapies that promote sequestration of toxic aggregates may prove useful in blocking the development of neurodegenerative disease. We previously demonstrated that proSAAS, a small secreted neuronal protein, exhibits potent chaperone activity against protein aggregation in vitro, and blocks the cytotoxic effects of amyloid and alpha synuclein oligomers in cell culture models. We now examine whether cytoplasmic expression of proSAAS results in interaction with protein aggregates in this cellular compartment. We used site-directed mutagenesis, confocal microscopy, in vitro aggregation assays, and functional assays to investigate the interaction of proSAAS with TDP-43 and other known aggregating proteins. We report that expression of proSAAS within the cytoplasm generates dense, membrane-less 2 m proSAAS spheres which progressively fuse to form larger spheres, suggesting liquid droplet-like properties. ProSAAS spheres selectively accumulate a C-terminally truncated fluorescently-tagged form of TDP-43216-414, initiating its cellular redistribution by sequestration within the sphere core; these TDP-43216-414 -containing spheres also exhibit dynamic fusion. Removal of either the predicted -helix (37-70) composed of hydrophobic and charged amino acids or the stretch of amino acids encompassing the conserved hydrophobic region and the positively charged furin site (163-189) inhibits the ability of proSAAS both to form spheres and to encapsulate TDP-43 aggregates. As a functional output, we demonstrate that proSAAS expression results in cytoprotection against full-length TDP-43 toxicity in yeast. In summary, the normally secreted neuronal chaperone proSAAS, when expressed in the cytoplasm unexpectedly phase-separates to form spherical liquid-like condensates that undergo dynamic fusion. We conclude that cyto-proSAAS acts as a functional holdase for cytoplasmic TDP-43216-414 molecules via this phase-separation property, representing a cytoprotectant whose unusual biochemical properties can potentially be exploited in the design of therapeutic molecules.",

To identify whether alternative metabolic routes of glycolysis can operate in E. coli, we complementarily employed in silico design, rational engineering, and adaptive laboratory evolution. First, we used a genome-scale model and identified two potential pathways within the metabolic network of this organism replacing canonical Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolysis to convert phosphosugars into organic acids. One of these glycolytic routes proceeds via methylglyoxal, the other via serine biosynthesis and degradation. Then, we implemented both pathways in E. coli strains harboring defective EMP glycolysis. Surprisingly, the pathway via methylglyoxal immediately operated in a triosephosphate isomerase deletion strain cultivated on glycerol. By contrast, in a phosphoglycerate kinase deletion strain, the overexpression of methylglyoxal synthase was necessary for implementing a functional methylglyoxal pathway. Furthermore, we engineered the  serine shunt which converts 3-phosphoglycerate via serine biosynthesis and degradation to pyruvate, bypassing an enolase deletion. Finally, to explore which of these alternatives would emerge by natural selection we performed an adaptive laboratory evolution study using an enolase deletion strain. The evolved mutants were shown to use the serine shunt. Our study reveals the flexible repurposing of metabolic pathways to create new metabolite links and rewire central metabolism.",

We compared the immune response of mice vaccinated with RBD/alum to mice vaccinated with RBD/alum+CpG. We also evaluated mice immunized with RBD/alum+CpG and boosted with RBD/alum. Mice were immunized twice intramuscularly at a 21-day interval.

Neutralizing antibody titers against the B.1.1.529 (BA.1, Omicron) variant exceeded those in human convalescent plasma after Wuhan infection but were lower than against the other variants. Interestingly, the second dose did not benefit from the addition of CpG, possibly allowing dose-sparing of the adjuvant in the future.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundRetinal pigment epithelium (RPE) aging is an important cause of vision loss. As RPE aging is accompanied by changes in cell morphological features, an accurate segmentation of RPE cells is a prerequisite to such morphology analyses. Due the overwhelmingly large cell number, manual annotations of RPE cell borders are time-consuming. Computer based methods do not work well on cells with weak or missing borders in the impaired RPE sheet regions.\n\nMethodTo address such a challenge, we develop a semi-supervised deep learning approach, namely MultiHeadGAN, to segment low contrast cells from impaired regions in RPE flatmount images. The developed deep learning model has a multi-head structure that allows model training with only a small scale of human annotated data. To strengthen model learning effect, we further train our model with RPE cells without ground truth cell borders by generative adversarial networks. Additionally, we develop a new shape loss to guide the network to produce closed cell borders in the segmentation results.\n\nResultsIn this study, 155 annotated and 1,640 unlabeled image patches are included for model training. The testing dataset consists of 200 image patches presenting large impaired RPE regions. The average RPE segmentation performance of the developed model MultiHeadGAN is 85.4 (correct rate), 88.8 (weighted correct rate), 87.3 (precision), and 80.1 (recall), respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, our method demonstrates superior qualitative and quantitative performance.\n\nConclusionsSuggested by our extensive experiments, our developed deep learning method can accurately segment cells from RPE flatmount microscopy images and is promising to support large scale cell morphological analyses for RPE aging investigations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundFragile X syndrome (FXS), the most prevalent inherited intellectual disability and one of the most common monogenic form of autism, is caused by a loss of FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1). We have previously shown that FMR1 represses the levels and activities of ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in young adult FMR1-deficient mice and treatment by a MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 rescues both hippocampal neurogenic and cognitive deficits in FMR1-deficient mice when analyzed shortly after the administration. However, it is unknown whether Nutlin-3 treatment can have long-lasting therapeutic effects.\n\nMethodsWe treated 2-month-old young adult FMR1-deficient mice with Nutlin-3 for 10 days and then assessed the persistent effect of Nutlin-3 on both cognitive functions and adult neurogenesis when mice were 6-month-old mature adults. To investigate the mechanisms underlying persistent effects of Nutlin-3, we analyzed proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells isolated from these mice and assessed the transcriptome of the hippocampal tissues of treated mice.\n\nResultsWe found that transient treatment with Nutlin-3 of 2-month-old young adult FMR1-deficient mice prevents the emergence of neurogenic and cognitive deficits in mature adult FXS mice at 6-month of age. We further found that the long-lasting restoration of neurogenesis and cognitive function might not be mediated by changing intrinsic properties of adult neural stem cells. Transcriptomic analysis of the hippocampal tissue demonstrated that transient Nultin-3 treatment leads to significant expression changes in genes related to extracellular matrix, secreted factors, and cell membrane proteins in FMR1-deficient hippocampus.\n\nConclusionsOur data indicates that transient Nutlin-3 treatment in young adults leads to long-lasting neurogenic and behavioral changes through modulating adult neurogenic niche rather than intrinsic properties of adult neural stem cells. Our results demonstrate that cognitive impairments in FXS may be prevented by an early intervention through Nutlin-3 treatment.",

However, the pattern and function of m6A modification during Chlamydomonas sexual reproduction is still unknown. Here, we performed transcriptome and MeRIP sequencing on the six samples from different stages during sexual reproduction of Chlamydomonas life cycle. The results showed that m6A occurs widely at the main motif of UGKAM (K= U/G, M= A/C) in Chlamydomonas mRNA. Moreover, m6A peak in Chlamydomonas mRNA is mainly enriched in the 3UTR region and negatively correlated with the abundance of the transcripts at each stage. Especially, genes in microtubule-associated pathway showed a significant negative correlation between gene expression level and m6A level, indicating the influences of m6A modification on sexual reproduction and life cycle of Chlamydomonas through regulating microtubule-based movement. In summary, our findings first demonstrate the distributions and the functions of m6A modification in Chlamydomonas and provide new insights into the understandings of m6A modification in the process of sexual reproduction in other plant organisms evolutionarily.",

Survival during freshwater and marine migration is known to have population level effects, thus an understanding of the patterns of mortality has the potential to yield important insights into population bottlenecks. Despite important advancements in tracking techniques, the specifics of mortality events in anadromous salmonids during their initial migration to sea remains somewhat elusive. Here, we develop a framework combining spatial and temporal detections of smolt riverine migration from two tracking techniques, which enable inferences to be made about mortality locations, causes, and rates. In this study, we demonstrate that during their initial riverine transitional phase, smolts were particularly vulnerable to predators. Specifically, avian predation appeared to be the main cause of mortality (42%), although piscine predation events were not trivial (14%). Our results suggested some direct and indirect tagging-induced mortality (e.g., through increased predation vulnerability), which highlights the importance of determining tagging mortality in a telemetry study to ensure adequate interpretation of migration success. Overall, by estimating migration loss and its variability, our study framework should help to guide management actions to mitigate the widespread population declines these species are currently facing.",

Convalescent sera as well as sera obtained from participants who received two or three doses of mRNA vaccines (Moderna-mRNA-1273(R) or Pfizer-BNT162b2(R)) were used for comparison in this study. Our data demonstrate that both the Delta as well as Omicron variants exhibit higher affinity for the receptor ACE2, facilitating infection and causing antibody escape by receptor affinity (affinity escape), due to reduced ability of antibodies to compete with RBD-receptor interaction and virus neutralization. In contrast, only Omicron but not Delta variant escaped antibody recognition, most likely because only Omicron exhibit the mutation at position E484 associated with reduced recognition, resulting in further reduced neutralization (specificity escape). Nevertheless, the immunizations with RNA based vaccines resulted in marked viral neutralization in vitro for all strains, compatible with the fact that Omicron is still largely susceptible to vaccination-induced antibodies, despite affinity- and specificity escape.",

Signs of progress have been achieved but are still limited. This paper intends to prove the existence of at least three genomic signature patterns and at least seven subtypes of COVID-19 driven by five critical genes (the smallest subset of genes). These signatures and subtypes provide crucial genomic information in COVID-19 diagnosis (including ICU patients), research focuses, and treatment methods. Unlike existing approaches focused on gene fold-changes and pathways, gene-gene nonlinear and competing interactions are the driving forces in finding the signature patterns and subtypes. Furthermore, the method leads to 100% accuracy, which shows biological and mathematical equivalences between COVID-19 status and the signature patterns and a methodological advantage over other existing methods that cannot lead to 100% accuracy. As a result, as new biomarkers, the new findings can be much more informative than other findings for interpreting biological mechanisms, developing the second (third) generation of vaccines, antiviral drugs, and treatment methods, and eventually bringing new hopes to an end of the pandemic.",

Apart from Omicron, we found all variants to frequently spread to and within the CNS. Infection was restricted to neurons and appeared to spread from the olfactory bulb mainly in basally orientated regions in the brain and into the spinal cord, independent of ACE2 expression and without evidence of neuronal cell death, axonal damage or demyelination. However, microglial activation, microgliosis and a mild macrophage and T cell dominated inflammatory response was consistently observed, accompanied by apoptotic death of endothelial, microglial and immune cells, without their apparent infection. Microgliosis and immune cell apoptosis indicate a potential role of microglia for pathogenesis and viral effect in COVID-19 and possible impairment of neurological functions, especially in long COVID.

    "preprint_abstract": "Human intelligence is one of the main objects of study in cognitive neuroscience. Reviews and meta-analyses have proved to be fundamental to establish and cement neuroscientific theories on intelligence. The prediction of intelligence using in vivo neuroimaging data and machine learning has become a widely accepted and replicated result. Here, we present a systematic review of this growing area of research, based on studies that employ structural, functional, and/or diffusion MRI to predict human intelligence in cognitively normal subjects using machine-learning. We performed a systematic assessment of methodological and reporting quality, using the PROBAST and TRIPOD assessment forms and 30 studies identified through a systematic search. We observed that fMRI is the most employed modality, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is the most studied predictor, and the Human Connectome Project is the most employed dataset. A meta-analysis revealed a significant difference between the performance obtained in the prediction of general and fluid intelligence from fMRI data, confirming that the quality of measurement moderates this association. The expected performance of studies predicting general intelligence from fMRI was estimated to be r = 0.42 (CI95% = [0.35, 0.50]) while for studies predicting fluid intelligence obtained from a single test, expected performance was estimated as r = 0.15 (CI95% = [0.13, 0.17]). We further enumerate some virtues and pitfalls we identified in the methods for the assessment of intelligence and machine learning. The lack of treatment of confounder variables, including kinship, and small sample sizes were two common occurrences in the literature which increased risk of bias. Reporting quality was fair across studies, although reporting of results and discussion could be vastly improved. We conclude that the current literature on the prediction of intelligence from neuroimaging data is reaching maturity. Performance has been reliably demonstrated, although extending findings to new populations is imperative. Current results could be used by future works to foment new theories on the biological basis of intelligence differences.",

Here, the local field potentials in the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) were recorded simultaneously in rats during the execution of the episodic-like memory task. The power of hippocampal theta (~4-10 Hz), slow gamma (~25-50 Hz), and fast gamma oscillations (~55-100 Hz) was analyzed in all structures examined. Particular attention was paid to the theta coherence between three mentioned structures. The modulation of the power of gamma rhythms by the phase of theta cycle during the execution of the episodic-like memory test by rats was also closely studied. Healthy rats and rats one month after kainate-induced status epilepticus (SE) were examined. Paroxysmal activity in the hippocampus (high amplitude interictal spikes), excessive excitability of animals, and the death of hippocampal and dentate granular cells in rats with kainate-evoked SE were observed, which indicated the development of seizure focus in the hippocampus (epileptogenesis). One month after SE, the rats exhibited a specific impairment of episodic memory for the what-where-when triad: unlike healthy rats, epileptogenic SE animals did not identify the objects during the test. This impairment was associated with the changes in the characteristics of theta and gamma rhythms and specific violation of theta coherence and theta/gamma coupling in these structures in comparison with the healthy animals. We believe that these disturbances in the cortical areas play a role in episodic memory dysfunction in kainate-treated animals. These findings can shed light on the mechanisms of cognitive deficit during epileptogenesis.",

How the cerebellum supports affective function remains poorly understood. The short-latency (just a few ms) functional connections that were identified between the cerebellum and amygdala -a structure crucial for the processing of emotion and valence-more than 4 decades ago raise the exciting, yet untested, possibility that a cerebellum-amygdala pathway communicates information important for emotion. The major hurdle in rigorously testing this possibility is the lack of knowledge about the anatomy and functional connectivity of this pathway. Our initial anatomical tracing studies in mice excluded the existence of a direct monosynaptic pathway between cerebellum and amygdala. Using transneuronal tracing techniques, we have identified a novel disynaptic pathway that connects the cerebellar output nuclei to the basolateral amygdala. This pathway recruits the understudied intralaminar thalamus as a node. Using ex vivo optophysiology and super-resolution microscopy, we provide the first evidence for the functionality of the pathway, thus offering a missing mechanistic link between the cerebellum and amygdala. This discovery provides a connectivity blueprint between the cerebellum and a key structure of the limbic system. As such, it is the requisite first step toward obtaining new knowledge about cerebellar function in emotion, thus fundamentally advancing understanding of the neurobiology of emotion, which is perturbed in mental and autism spectrum disorders.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Even though most axonal cargos are synthesized in the soma, the concentration of many of these cargos is larger at the presynaptic terminal than in the soma. This requires transport of these cargos from the soma to the presynaptic terminal or other active sites in the axon. Axons utilize both bidirectional (for example, slow axonal transport) and unidirectional (for example, fast anterograde axonal transport) modes of cargo transport. Bidirectional transport seems to be less efficient because it requires more time and takes more energy to deliver cargos. In this paper, we studied a family of models which differ by the modes of axonal cargo transport (such as anterograde and retrograde motor-driven transport and passive diffusion) as well as by the presence or absence of pausing states. The models are studied to investigate their ability to describe axonal transport against the cargo concentration gradient. We argue that bidirectional axonal transport is described by a higher-order mathematical model, which allows imposing cargo concentration not only at the axon hillock but also at the axon terminal. The unidirectional transport model allows only for the imposition of cargo concentration at the axon hillock. Due to the great lengths of the axons, anterograde transport mostly relies on molecular motors, such as kinesins, to deliver cargos synthesized in the soma to the terminal and other active sites in the axon. Retrograde transport can be also motor-driven, in which case cargos are transported by dynein motors. If cargo concentration at the axon tip is higher than at the axon hillock, retrograde transport can also occur by cargo diffusion. However, because many axonal cargos are large or they assemble in multiprotein complexes for axonal transport, the diffusivity of such cargos is very small. We investigated the case of a small cargo diffusivity using a perturbation technique and found that for this case the effect of diffusion is limited to a very thin diffusion boundary layer near the axon tip. If cargo diffusivity is decreased in the model, we show that without motor-driven retrograde transport the model is unable to describe a high cargo concentration at the axon tip. To the best of our knowledge, our paper presents the first explanation for the utilization of seemingly inefficient bidirectional transport in neurons.",

Apple (Malus domestica) is one of the most widely cultivated fruit trees with great economical importance. However, poor knowledge is known about the apple UGTs. In this study, we identified 229 members of family 1 through a genome-wide analysis of the apple UGTs, which were clustered into 18 groups, from A to R. We also performed detailed analysis to 34 apple UGTs with quantitavive RT-PCR, and discovered a number of stress-regulated UGTs. Among them, we characterized the role of MD09G1064900, also named as MdUGT83L3, which is significantly induced by salt and cold. In vivo analysis showed that it has high activity towards cyanidin, and moderate activity towards quercetin and keampferol. The transgenic callus and regenerated apple plants overexpressing MdUGT83L3 showed enhanced tolerance to salt and cold treatments. Overexpression of MdUGT83L3 also increased anthocyanin accumulation in the callus tissues and enhanced ROS clearing upon exposed to salt and cold stresses. Futhermore, via yeast-two-hybrid assay, EMSA and CHIP analysis, we also found that MdUGT83L3 could be directly regualted by MdMYB88. Our study indicated that MdUGT83L3, under the regulation of MdMYB88, plays important roles in salt and cold stress adaptation via modulating flavonoid metabolism in apple.",

The factors that govern pathogenicity of this organism are multi-factorial and are poorly understood. Molecular tools to dissect the mechanisms of pathogenicity in A. fumigatus have improved significantly over the last 20 years however many procedures have not been standardised for A. fumigatus. Here, we present a new genomic safe-haven locus at the site of an inactivated transposon, named SH-aft4, which can be used to insert DNA sequences in the genome of this fungus without impacting its phenotype. We show that we are able to effectively express a transgene construct from the SH-aft4 and that natural regulation of promoter function is conserved at this site. Furthermore, the SH-aft4 locus is highly conserved in the genome of a wide range of clinical and environmental isolates including the isolates commonly used by many laboratories CEA10, Af293 and ATCC46645, allowing a wide range of isolates to be manipulated. Our results show that the aft4 locus can serve as a site for integration of a wide range of genetic constructs to aid functional genomics studies of this important human fungal pathogen.",

However, although disparities across research fields and techniques are not unknown, they remain largely unexplored. The present scoping review aims to provide a first overview of statistical methods used in biochemical research involving immunoblotting (also referred to as western blotting), a technique frequently used to quantify proteins of interest. A reverse chronological systematic sampling was implemented to explore the PubMed online browser and analyse 2932 experimental conditions (i.e., experimental groups) in quantitative immunoblots from 64 articles published at the end of 2021. The statistical test (actual study size n = 67) and software (actual study size n = 61) used for each article and the sample size for each experimental condition were documented. The results indicate an omnipresence of parametric tests, mostly one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, 15/67) and Students t-test (13/67), but for many articles the statistical procedure was not clearly divulged (23/67). GraphPad Prism was the most commonly used statistical package (36/61), but many (14/61) articles did not reveal the package used. Finally, the sample size was clearly disclosed in only 1054/2932 conditions in which its median value was 3 (IQR = [3 - 6]). This study suggests that the transparency of reporting might be suboptimal in immunoblotting research and prompts more comprehensive systematic reviews in future.",

The parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus is an important model organism widely used for studies of drug resistance and drug screening with the current gold standard being the motility assay. We applied a deep learning approach Mask R-CNN for analysing motility videos containing varying rates of motile worms and compared it to other commonly used algorithms with different levels of complexity, namely the Wiggle Index and the Wide Field-of-View Nematode Tracking Platform. Mask R-CNN consistently outperformed the other algorithms in terms of the detection of worms as well as the precision of motility forecasts, having a mean absolute percentage error of 7.6% and a mean absolute error of 5.6% for the detection and motility forecasts, respectively. Using Mask R-CNN for motility assays confirmed the common problem with algorithms that use non-maximum suppression in detecting overlapping objects, which negatively impacts the overall precision. The use of intersect over union as a measure of the classification of motile / non-motile instances had an overall accuracy of 89%, indicating that it is a viable alternative to previously used methods based on movement characteristics, such as body bends. In comparison to the existing methods evaluated here, Mask R-CNN performed better and we anticipate that this method will broaden the number of possible approaches to video analysis of worm motility.",

Conceptually, this ability is attributed to internal forward models, which are neural networks that can predict the sensory consequences of motor commands. While the cerebellum is considered as a potential locus of internal forward models, evidence for its involvement in mental practice is missing. In our study, we employed single and dual transcranial magnetic stimulation technique to probe the level of corticospinal excitability and of cerebellar-brain inhibition, respectively, before and after a mental practice session or a control session. Motor skills (i.e., accuracy and speed) were measured using a sequential finger tapping-task. Here, we show that mental practice enhances both speed and accuracy. In parallel, the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex changes, with less inhibition from the first to the second, expressing the existence of neuroplastic changes within the cerebellum after mental practice. These findings reveal that the corticocerebellar loop is a major neural circuit for skill improvement after mental practice.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully applied in various neurodegenerative diseases as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, its mechanisms of action within the brain network are still poorly understood. Many virtual DBS models analyze a subnetwork around the basal ganglia and its dynamics as a spiking network with their details validated by experimental data. However, connectomic evidence shows widespread effects of DBS affecting many different cortical and subcortical areas. From a clinical perspective, various effects of DBS besides the motoric impact have been demonstrated. The neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain (TVB) offers a modeling framework allowing us to virtually perform stimulation, including DBS, and forecast the outcome from a dynamic systems perspective prior to invasive surgery with DBS lead placement. For an accurate prediction of the effects of DBS, we implement a detailed spiking model of the basal ganglia, which we combine with TVB via our previously developed co-simulation environment. This multiscale co-simulation approach builds on the extensive previous literature of spiking models of the basal ganglia while simultaneously offering a whole-brain perspective on widespread effects of the stimulation going beyond the motor circuit. In the first demonstration of our model, we show that virtual DBS can move the firing rates of a Parkinsons disease patients thalamus - basal ganglia network towards the healthy regime while, at the same time, altering the activity in distributed cortical regions with a pronounced effect in frontal regions. Thus, we provide proof of concept for virtual DBS in a co-simulation environment with TVB. The developed modeling approach has the potential to optimize DBS lead placement and configuration and forecast the success of DBS treatment for individual patients.\n\nHighlights- We implement and validate a co-simulation approach of a spiking network model for subcortical regions in and around the basal ganglia and interface it with mean-field network models for each cortical region.\n- Our simulations are based on a normative connectome including detailed tracts between the cortex and the basal ganglia regions combined with subject-specific optimized weights for a healthy control and a patient with Parkinsons disease.\n- We provide proof of concept by demonstrating that the implemented model shows biologically plausible dynamics during resting state including decreased thalamic activity in the virtual patient and during virtual deep brain stimulation including normalized thalamic activity and distributed altered cortical activity predominantly in frontal regions.\n- The presented co-simulation model can be used to tailor deep brain stimulation for individual patients.",

Still, the mechanisms at play when generating induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells is only partly understood. Here we show that the RNA specific N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase ALKBH5 regulates somatic cell reprogramming in a stage specific manner. Knockdown or knockout of Alkbh5 in the early reprogramming phase impairs the reprogramming efficiency by reducing the proliferation rate through arresting the cells at G2/M phase and decreasing the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) rate. However, there is no significant change in reprogramming efficiency when Alkbh5 is depleted at the late phase of reprogramming. On the other hand, ALKBH5 overexpression at the earlyreprogramming phase has no significant impact on reprogramming efficiency, while overexpression at the late phase enhances the reprogramming by stabilizing Nanog transcripts resulting in upregulated Nanog expression. Our study provides mechanistic insight into the crucial dynamic role of ALKBH5 in regulating somatic cell reprogramming at the posttranscriptional level.",

This new approach consistently shows a decrease in EEGs complexity during slow-wave sleep, yet it is unclear how cortical oscillations shape these complexity variations. In this work, we analyse how the frequency content of brain signals affects the complexity estimates in freely moving rats. We find that the low-frequency spectrum - including the Delta, Theta, and Sigma frequency bands - drives the complexity changes during the sleep-wake states. This happens because low-frequency oscillations emerge from neuronal population patterns, as we show by recovering the complexity variations during the sleep-wake cycle from micro, meso, and macroscopic recordings. Moreover, we find that the lower frequencies reveal synchronisation patterns across the neocortex, such as a sensory-motor decoupling that happens during REM sleep. Overall, our works shows that EEGs low frequencies are critical in shaping the sleep-wake states complexity across cortical scales.",

High genome plasticity has been often reported in Fungi, which may explain their apparent ability to quickly adapt to new environments. Cryphonectria parasitica, causing the Chestnut blight disease, is an invasive fungal pathogen species associated with several recent host shifts during its successive introductions from Asia to North America and Europe. Previous cytological karyotyping and genomic studies suggested several chromosomal rearrangements which remains to be described in detail for this species. A serious limitation for valid genome comparisons is the access to robust genome assemblies that usually contain genomic regions of low complexity. We present a new de novo whole-genome assembly obtained from a new method of DNA extraction and long-reads sequencing Nanopore technology obtained from a Japanese isolate sampled in the native area of the species. The comparison with a recently published reference genome revealed stable gene and transposable elements (TEs) repertoires. We also showed that the C. parasitica genome is lowly compartmentalized, with a poor association between TEs and genes, such as those potentially involved in host interactions (i.e., genes coding for small secreted proteins or for secondary metabolites). This genome comparison, however, detected several large chromosomal rearrangements that may have important consequences in gene regulations and sexual mating in this invasive species. This study opens the way for more comparisons of high-quality assembled genomes, and questions the role of structural variations in the invasive success of this fungal pathogen species.",

The human genome contains a vast number of enhancers, which largely outnumber protein-coding genes. Classically, enhancers have been regarded as highly tissue-specific. However, recent evidence suggests that many enhancers are pleiotropic, with activity in multiple developmental contexts. Yet, the extent and impact of pleiotropy remain largely unexplored. In this study we predicted active enhancers across human organs based on the analysis of both eRNA transcription (FANTOM5 consortium datasets) and chromatin architecture (ENCODE consortium datasets). We show that pleiotropic enhancers are pervasive in the human genome and that most enhancers active in a particular organ are also active in other organs. In addition, our analysis suggests that the proportion of context-specific enhancers of a given organ is explained, at least in part, by the proportion of context-specific genes in that same organ. The notion that such a high proportion of human enhancers can be pleiotropic suggests that small regions of regulatory DNA contain abundant regulatory information and that these regions evolve under important evolutionary constraints.\n\nSignificance statementThe human genome contains a vast number of regulatory elements, named enhancers, that control the tempo and mode of gene expression. Classically, enhancers have been regarded as genetic elements that are active in a single organ, but recent evidence suggests that many enhancers in animal genomes are active in multiple organs (i.e., are pleiotropic). Here we shed light on the architecture of non-coding human DNA by showing that a large percentage of the enhancers of the human genome are pleiotropic and that the majority of enhancers active in a particular organ are pleiotropic. This suggests that small regions of regulatory DNA may contain abundant regulatory information and that these regions evolve under important evolutionary constraints.",

RBPs are critical for post-transcriptional mechanisms keeping gene regulation in a fine equilibrium. Conversely, dysregulation of RBPs and RNA metabolism pathways is an established hallmark of tumorigenesis. Human nucleolin (NCL) is a multifunctional RBP that interacts with different types of RNA molecules, in part through its four RNA binding domains (RBDs). Particularly, NCL interacts directly with microRNAs (miRNAs) and is involved in their aberrant processing linked with many cancers, including breast cancer. Nonetheless, molecular details of the NCL-miRNA interaction remain obscure. In this study, we used an in silico approach to characterize how NCL targets miRNAs and whether this specificity is imposed by a definite RBD-interface. Here, we present structural models of NCL-RBDs and miRNAs, as well as predict scenarios of NCL- miRNA interactions generated using docking algorithms. Our study suggests a predominant role of NCL RBDs 3 and 4 (RBD3-4) in miRNA binding. We provide detailed analyses of specific motifs/residues at the NCL- substrate interface in both these RBDs and miRNAs. Finally, we propose that the evolutionary emergence of more than two RBDs in NCL in higher organisms coincides with its additional role/s in miRNA processing. Our study shows that RBD3-4 display sequence/structural determinants to specifically recognize miRNA precursor molecules. Moreover, the insights from this study can ultimately support the design of novel antineoplastic drugs aimed at regulating NCL-dependent biological pathways with a causal role in tumorigenesis.\n\nImportance/impact of the studyNucleolin is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that is often linked with many cancers. Similarly, microRNAs are often dysregulated in many cancers and linked to tumorigenesis. This study focuses on the interaction of nucleolin with microRNAs to identify previously unknown mechanistic details/specificity of these interactions. The insights from this study can ultimately support the design of novel drugs aimed at regulating NCL- dependent pathways implicated in tumorigenesis.",

A quantitative understanding of the key processes driving EBOV assembly and budding could provide valuable insights to inform drug development. Here we used a computational model to evaluate EBOV matrix assembly. Our model focused on the assembly kinetics of VP40, the matrix protein in EBOV, and its interaction with phosphatidylserine (PS) in the host cell membrane. Human cells transfected with VP40-expressing plasmids are capable of producing virus-like particles (VLPs) that closely resemble EBOV virions. We used data from this in vitro VP40 system to calibrate our computational model. PS levels in the host cell membrane had been shown to affect VP40 dynamics as well as VLP production through recruiting VP40 dimers to plasma membrane inner leaflet. Our computational results indicated that PS may have direct influence on VP40 filament growth and affect multiple steps in the assembly and budding of VP40 VLPs. We also proposed that the assembly of VP40 filaments may follow the nucleation-elongation theory where initialization and oligomerization of VP40 are two separate and distinct steps in the assembly process. This work illustrated how computational and experimental approaches can be combined to allow for additional analysis and hypothesis generation. Our findings advanced understanding of the molecular process of EBOV assembly and budding processes and may help the development of new EBOV treatments targeting VP40 matrix assembly.",

Although MYC is overexpressed in both early and metastatic disease and associated with poor survival, its impact on prostate transcriptional reprogramming remains elusive. We demonstrate that MYC overexpression significantly diminishes the androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional program (the set of genes directly targeted by the AR protein) in luminal prostate cells without altering AR expression. Importantly, analyses of clinical specimens revealed that concurrent low AR and high MYC transcriptional programs accelerate prostate cancer progression toward a metastatic, castration-resistant disease. Data integration of single-cell transcriptomics together with ChIP-seq revealed an increased RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter-proximal pausing at AR-dependent genes following MYC overexpression without an accompanying deactivation of AR-bound enhancers. Altogether, our findings suggest that MYC overexpression antagonizes the canonical AR transcriptional program and contributes to prostate tumor initiation and progression by disrupting transcriptional pause release at AR-regulated genes.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEAR and MYC are key to prostate cancer etiology but our current understanding of their interplay is scarce.

Moreover, we find that loss of transcription factor H15 increases sarcomere branching frequency in the tubular jump muscles, and we show that sarcomere branching can be turned on in IF muscles by salm-mediated conversion to tubular muscles. Finally, we demonstrate that neurochondrin knockdown results in myofibrillar connectivity in IF muscles without conversion to tubular muscles.

However, conductive pulses are widely reported at low salt conditions wherein electroosmotic flow can be quite significant. Aside from transporting molecules like DNA, we investigated whether electroosmotic flow has other potential impacts on sensing attributes such current enhancements due to the analyte molecule. The overwhelming majority of literature reports counterions as the dominant mechanism of conductive events (a moleculecentric theory for conductive events). Conductive events are not well understood due to the complex interplay between (charged) nanopore walls, DNA grooves, ion mobility, and counterion clouds. Yet, the prevailing consensus of counterions being introduced into the pore by the molecule does not fit well with a growing number of experiments including the fact that proteins can generate conductive events despite having a heterogeneous surface charge. Herein, we demonstrate theory and experiments underpinning the translocation mechanism (i.e., electroosmosis or electrophoresis), pulse direction (i.e., conductive or resistive) and shape (e.g., monophasic or biphasic) through fine control of chemical, physical, and electronic parameters. Results from these studies predict strong electroosmosis plays a role in driving DNA events and generating conductive events due to polarization effects (i.e. a pore-centric theory). We believe these findings will stimulate a useful discussion on the nature of conductive events and their impact on molecular sensing in nanoscale pores.",

The pioneering studyforrest and other naturalistic neuroimaging projects have provided free access to multiple movie-watching functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to prompt the community for naturalistic experimental paradigms. However, sluggish blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI signals are incapable of resolving neuronal activity with the temporal resolution at which it unfolds. Instead, magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures changes in the magnetic field produced by neuronal activity and is able to capture rich dynamics of the brain at the millisecond level while watching naturalistic movies. Herein, we present the first public prolonged MEG dataset collected from 11 participants while watching the 2 h long audio-visual movie \"Forrest Gump\". Minimally preprocessed data was also provided to facilitate the use of the dataset. As a studyforrest extension, we envision that this dataset, together with fMRI data from the studyforrest project, will serve as a foundation for exploring the neural dynamics of various cognitive functions in real-world contexts.",

Skin lesions are the most common manifestation of CNC, including lentigines, blue nevi and cutaneous myxomas, in unusual locations such as oral and genital mucosa. Unlike endocrine disorders, the pathogenesis of skin lesions remains unexplained. Here, we show that embryonic invalidation of the Prkar1a gene in Steroidogenic Factor-1-expressing cells, leads to the development of familial skin pigmentation alterations reminiscent of those in patients. Immunohistological and molecular analyses coupled with genetic monitoring of recombinant cell lineages in mouse skin, suggest that familial lentiginosis and myxomas occurs in skin areas specifically enriched in dermal melanocytes. In lentigines and blue nevi-prone areas from mutant mice and patients, Prkar1a/PRKAR1A invalidation occurs in a subset of dermal fibroblasts capable of inducing, under the influence of PKA signaling, the production of pro-melanogenic EDN3 and HGF signals. Our model strongly suggests that the origin of the typical CNC cutaneous lesions is the result of non-cell-autonomous pro-melanogenic activity of a dermal fibroblast population sharing a community of origin with SF-1 lineage.",

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we cultivated the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under highly controlled photobioreactor conditions and revealed systems-wide shared and unique responses to 24-hour moderate (35{degrees}C) and acute (40{degrees}C) high temperatures and subsequent recovery at 25{degrees}C. We identified previously overlooked unique elements in response to moderate high temperature. Heat at 35{degrees}C transiently arrested the cell cycle followed by partial synchronization, up-regulated transcripts/proteins involved in gluconeogenesis/glyoxylate-cycle for carbon uptake, promoted growth, and increased starch accumulation. Heat at 40{degrees}C arrested the cell cycle, inhibited growth, resulting in carbon uptake over usage and increased starch accumulation. Both high temperatures induced photoprotection, while 40{degrees}C decreased photosynthetic efficiency, distorted thylakoid/pyrenoid ultrastructure, and affected the carbon concentrating mechanism. We demonstrated increased transcript/protein correlation during both heat treatments, suggesting reduced post-transcriptional regulation during heat may help coordinate heat tolerance activities efficiently. During recovery after both heat treatments, transcripts/proteins related to DNA synthesis increased while those involved in photosynthetic light reactions decreased. We propose down-regulating photosynthetic light reactions during DNA replication benefits cell cycle resumption by reducing ROS production.

We compared four different habitat types co-occurring within the reaches: lotic habitat (riffle and pool), bar-head (BH) lentic habitat, bar-tail (BT) lentic habitat (backwater) and isolated pond (IP) on sandy bars.\nC_LIO_LIThe trophic contributions of reservoir-derived plankton were significantly lower in lentic habitats (BH, 15.4%; BT, 10.4%; IP, 9.1%) than in lotic habitats (mean, 27.7%). This was especially notable for filter feeders that feed on suspended fine particulate organic matter (SFPOM). The three-source model analysis indicated a lower biomass proportion of dam plankton in lentic SFPOM (mean, 21.2%) than in lotic SFPOM (mean, 35.6%). This difference in SFPOM composition was reflected in the lower trophic contribution of dam plankton to lentic filter feeders.\nC_LIO_LIThe abundance ratio of filter feeders in the community was decreased in lentic habitats, while the abundance ratios of collector-gatherers, scrapers and shredders were increased. Macroinvertebrates in lentic habitats fed on sources less mixed with reservoir-derived plankton (e.g. benthic coarse particulate organic matter [BCPOM], benthic fine particulate organic matter [BFPOM] and epilithon); therefore, the trophic impact of reservoirs was indistinctive at the community level, indicating that lentic habitats can function as trophic refugia to mitigate the trophic impact of reservoirs.\nC_LIO_LIBecause lentic habitats were decreased in area (accounting for 5.7% of average total area) in the downstream reaches of dams due to riverbed degradation, lentic habitats must be created in order to restore the trophic impact of reservoirs in river ecosystems.\nC_LI",

The state-of-the-art approach based on all-to-all registration has proven to work well but its computational cost scales unfavourably with the number of particles N, namely as N2. Our method overcomes this problem and achieves a linear scaling of computational cost with N by making use of the Joint Registration of Multiple Point Clouds (JRMPC) method. Straightforward application of JRMPC fails as mostly locally optimal solutions are found. These usually contain several overlapping clusters, that each consist of well-aligned particles, but that have different poses. We solve this issue by repeated runs of JRMPC for different initial conditions, followed by a classification step to identify the clusters, and a connection step to link the different clusters obtained for different initializations. In this way a single well-aligned structure is obtained containing the majority of the particles.\n\nWe achieve reconstructions of experimental DNA-origami datasets consisting of close to 400 particles within only 10 min on a CPU, with an image resolution of 3.2 nm. In addition, we show artifact-free reconstructions of symmetric structures without making any use of the symmetry. We also demonstrate that the method works well for poor data with a low density of labelling and for 3D data.",

The evolution of conspicuous colour pattern in defended species can be strongly impaired because of increased detectability by predators. Nevertheless, such evolution of the colour pattern can be favoured if changes in conspicuousness result in Mullerian mimicry with other defended prey. Here, we develop a model describing the population dynamics of a conspicuous defended prey species, and we assess the invasion conditions of derived phenotypes that differ from the ancestral phenotype by their conspicuousness. Such change in conspicuousness may then modify their level of mimicry with the local community of defended species. Derived colour pattern displayed in this focal population can therefore be either exactly similar, partially resembling or completely dissimilar to the local mimicry ring displaying the ancestral colour pattern. We assume that predation risk depends (1) on the number of individuals sharing a given colour pattern within the population, (2) on the occurrence of co-mimetic defended species, and (3) on the availability of alternative edible prey. Using a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we show that less conspicuous colour patterns are generally favoured within mimicry rings, unless reduced conspicuousness impairs mimicry. By contrast, when a mutation affecting the colour pattern leads to a shift toward a better protected mimicry ring, crypsis is no longer necessarily beneficial and a more conspicuous colour pattern can be favoured. The selected aposematic pattern then depends on the local composition of mimetic communities, as well as on the detectability, memorability and level of mimicry of the colour patterns.",

The core circadian clock gene Clk has been implicated in annual timing and shows highly conserved sequence homology across vertebrates except for one variable region of poly Glutamine repeats. Clk genotype varies in some species with latitude, seasonal timing and migration. However, findings are inconsistent, difficult to disentangle from environmental responses, and biased towards high latitudes. Here we combine field data with a common-garden set up to study associations of Clk with latitude, migration and annual-cycle timing within the stonechat species complex with trans-equatorial distribution range. Including 950 individuals from nine populations with diverse migratory strategies. Gene diversity was lowest in resident African and Canary Island populations and increased with latitude, independently of migration distance. Repeat length and annual-cycle timing was linked in a population-specific way. Specifically, equatorial African stonechats showed delayed timing with longer repeat length for all annual-cycle stages. Our data suggest that at low latitudes with constant photoperiod, Clk genotype might orchestrate a range of consistent, individual chronotypes. In contrast, the influence of Clk on annual-cycle timing at higher latitudes might be mediated by its interactions with genes involved in (circadian) photoperiodic pathways.",

These types of disturbance affect the shape of macroecological patterns, and therefore analyzing these patterns can provide insights into how ecosystems are affected by land use change. We here use arthropod census data from 96 sites at Terceira Island in the Azores archipelago across four different land uses of increasing management intensity: native forest, exotic forest, semi-natural pasture, and intensive pasture, to examine the effects of land use type on three macroecological patterns: the species abundance distribution, the metabolic rate distribution of individuals, and the species-area relationship. The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) has successfully predicted these patterns across habitats and taxa in undisturbed ecosystems, and thus provides a null expectation for their shapes. Across these patterns, we find that the forest habitats are the best fit by METE predictions, while the semi-natural pasture is consistently the worst fit, and the intensive pasture is intermediately well fit. We show that the direction of failure of the METE predictions at the pasture sites is likely due to the hyper-dominance of introduced spider species present there. We hypothesize that the particularly poor fit for the semi-natural pasture is due to the mix of arthropod communities out of equilibrium, leading to greater heterogeneity in composition and complex dynamics that violate METEs assumption of static state variables. The comparative better fit for the intensive pasture plausibly results from more homogeneous arthropod communities that are well adapted to intensive management, and thus whose state variables are less in flux. Analyzing deviations from theoretical predictions across land use type provides useful information about how land use and disturbance affect ecosystems, and such comparisons could be useful across other habitats and taxa.",

The mechanisms underlying such plasticity heterogeneity, implicated in context-specific resource allocation during encoding, have remained unexplored. Here, we employed a systematic, unbiased, and physiologically constrained search to identify the mechanisms behind plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells. We found that each of intrinsic, synaptic, and structural heterogeneities independently yielded heterogeneous plasticity profiles obtained with two different induction protocols. However, prior predictions about strong relationships between neuronal intrinsic excitability and plasticity emerged only when adult-neurogenesis-induced structural heterogeneities were accounted for. Strikingly, despite the concomitant expression of heterogeneities in structural, synaptic, and intrinsic neuronal properties, similar plasticity profiles were attainable through synergistic interactions among these heterogeneities. Importantly, consequent to strong relationships with intrinsic excitability measurements, we found that synaptic plasticity in the physiological range was achieved in immature cells despite their electrophysiologically-observed weak synaptic strengths. Together, our analyses unveil the dominance of neurogenesis-induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in granule cells. Broadly, these analyses emphasize that the mechanistic origins of and the implications for plasticity heterogeneities need quantitative characterization across brain regions, particularly focusing on context-specific encoding of learned behavior.",

Going beyond the question of whether colocalization is present or not, it addresses the question of whether the colocalization between two entities is influenced, positively or negatively, by their colocalization with a third entity. We showcase two applications of conditional colocalization analysis, one addressing the question of compartmentalization of molecular interactions, and one investigating the hierarchy of molecular interactions in a multimolecular complex.

    "preprint_abstract": "Known genetic variation for a pathogen, in conjunction with post-PCR melting curve analysis, can be leveraged to provide increased taxonomic detail for pathogen identification in commercial molecular diagnostic tests. The increased taxonomic detail may be used by clinicians and public health decision makers to observe circulation patterns, monitor for outbreaks, and inform local testing practices. We propose a method for expanding the taxonomic resolution of PCR diagnostic systems by incorporating a priori knowledge of the assay design and publicly available sequence information into a genotyping classification model. For multiplexed PCR systems, this framework is generalized to incorporate information from multiple assays that react with different gene targets of the same pathogen to increase classification accuracy. To illustrate the method, a hierarchical classification model is developed for the BioFire(R) Respiratory 2.1 Panel and the BioFire(R) Respiratory 2 Panel (collectively the BioFire Respiratory Panels - highly multiplexed PCR diagnostic tests) to predict the species of human adenovirus (HAdV) from Adenovirus Detected test results. Performance of the classification model was characterized via a 10-fold cross-validation on a labeled dataset and exhibited 95% {+/-} 4% accuracy. The model was then applied to the BioFire(R) Syndromic Trends dataset, which contains deidentified patient test data from BioFire Respiratory Panels collected at over 100 sites across the globe since 2015. Adenovirus Detected test results in BioFire Syndromic Trends were classified to produce predicted prevalence of each HAdV species within the United States from 2018 through 2021. These results show a marked change in both the predicted prevalence for HAdV and the species makeup with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, HAdV-B decreased from a pre-pandemic predicted prevalence of up to 40% to less than 5% in 2021, while HAdV-A and HAdV-F species both increased in predicted prevalence.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the diagnosis of infectious disease there is often a trade-off between time to result, cost, and the amount of information gained about the pathogen. We develop a method that can provide increased genotypic information about a pathogen in a test result, with no additional time or cost. Our method is applied to the BioFire Respiratory(R) 2.1 Panel and the BioFire Respiratory(R) 2 Panel to speciate positive test results for adenovirus. The method shows robust performance in correctly identifying the adenovirus species from the test results. We estimate the prevalence of each adenovirus species in the United States by applying this method to adenovirus positive test results in the BioFire Syndromic Trends network. This information can be used in near real-time to augment the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention efforts to monitor adenovirus species circulation. Our mathematical framework can be generalized to other genotyping applications.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a tumour suppressor gene that inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Mutations in TSC1 lead to a rare complex disorder of the same name, in which up to 50% of patients present with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a highly prevalent, early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviours, although the type and severity of symptoms show wide variability across individuals. Amongst different brain areas proposed to play a role in the development of ASD, the cerebellum is commonly reported to be altered, and cerebellar-specific deletion of Tsc1 in mice is sufficient to induce an ASD-like phenotype. Given that the mTOR pathway is crucial for proper cell replication and migration, this suggests that dysregulation of this pathway, particularly during critical phases of cerebellar development, could contribute to the establishment of ASD.\n\nHere, we used a mouse model of TSC to investigate gene and protein expression during embryonic and early postnatal periods of cerebellar development. We found that, at E18 and P7, mRNA levels of the cerebellar inhibitory interneuron marker Pax2 were dysregulated. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of mTOR pathway-related genes and downstream phosphorylation of S6. Differential gene correlation analysis revealed dynamic changes in correlated gene pairs across development, with an overall loss of correlation between mTOR- and cerebellar-related genes in Tsc1 mutants compared to controls. We corroborated the genetic findings by characterizing the mTOR pathway and cerebellar development on protein and cellular levels with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. We found that Pax2-expressing cells were hypertrophic at E18 while, at P7, their number was increased and maturation into parvalbumin-expressing cells delayed. Our findings indicate that E18 and P7 are crucial time points in cerebellar development in mice that are particularly susceptible to mTOR pathway dysregulation.\n\nManuscript contribution to the fieldASD is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, however little is known about the shared mechanisms underlying its aetiology. At the anatomical level, the cerebellum has been identified as one of the key structures involved in the development of ASD, whereas at the molecular level, mutations in the mTOR signalling pathway, essential for cell growth and proliferation, carry a high genetic risk for this disorder. We used a haploinsufficient tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) mouse model to investigate the effects of mTOR overactivation in the developing cerebellum. Tsc1 inhibits the mTOR pathway, and mice with cerebellar-specific deletion of Tsc1 have been shown to harbour an ASD-like phenotype. We found that Pax2 expression in the cerebellum is dysregulated at prenatal and early postnatal time points, leading to a delayed maturation of inhibitory interneurons. Our findings indicate that mTOR overactivity in the cerebellum selectively affects the development of cerebellar interneurons. This finding is in line with other studies, which found decreased numbers of inhibitory interneurons in other models of ASD. Therefore, deficits in the maturation of the inhibitory signalling could be one of the mechanisms integrating high-risk mutations that underlie ASD aetiology.",

Yet Gene x Environment research (GxE) currently deploys a limited toolkit on the genetic side to study gene-environment interplay: polygenic scores (PGS, or what we call mPGS) that reflect the influence of genetics on levels of an outcome. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a genetic summary measure better suited for GxE research. We develop what we call variance polygenic scores (vPGS), or polygenic scores that reflect genetic contributions to plasticity in outcomes. The first part of the analysis uses the UK Biobank (N ~ 326,000 in the training set) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to compare four approaches for constructing polygenic scores for plasticity. The results show that widely-used methods for discovering which genetic variants affect outcome variability fail to serve as distinctive new tools for GxE. Then, using the polygenic scores that do capture distinctive genetic contributions to plasticity, we analyze heterogeneous effects of a UK education reform on health and educational attainment. The results show the properties of a new tool useful for population scientists studying the interplay of nature and nurture and for population-based studies that are releasing polygenic scores to applied researchers.",

In contrast, defective precursors, including aberrant TA proteins, form a stable complex with this cytosolic protein quality control factor, enabling such clients to be either productively re-routed or selectively degraded. We identify the mitochondrial TA protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein) as an endogenous client of both SGTA and the BAG6 complex. Our data suggest that the BAG6 complex binds to a cytosolic pool of MAVS before its misinsertion into the ER membrane, from where it can subsequently be removed via ATP13A1-mediated dislocation. This BAG6- associated fraction of MAVS is dynamic and responds to the activation of an innate immune response, suggesting that BAG6 may modulate the pool of MAVS that is available for coordinating the cellular response to viral infection.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTMitochondrial antiviral-signalling (MAVS) protein is a favoured client of the cytosolic BAG6 complex. We discuss how this dynamic interaction may modulate MAVS biogenesis at signalling membranes.",

PF is thought to derive from epithelial failure, particularly that of type II alveolar epithelial (AT2) cells, which are highly dependent on Wnt signaling during development and adult regeneration. We use human iPSC-derived AT2 (iAT2) cells to model how short telomeres affect AT2 cells. Cultured DC mutant iAT2 cells accumulate shortened, uncapped telomeres and manifest defects in the growth of alveolospheres, hallmarks of senescence, and apparent defects in Wnt signaling. The GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021, which mimics the output of canonical Wnt signaling, enhances telomerase activity and rescues the defects.

    "preprint_abstract": "Enveloped viruses, in general, have several transmembrane proteins and glycoproteins, which assist the virus in entry and attachment onto the host cells. These proteins also play a significant role in determining the shape and size of the newly formed virus particles. The lipid membrane and the embedded proteins affect each other in non-trivial ways during the course of the viral life cycle. Unravelling the nature of the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, under various environmental and physiological conditions, could therefore prove to be crucial in development of therapeutics. Here, we study the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the effect of temperature on the properties of the protein-membrane system. The membrane embedded dimeric M proteins were studied using atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures ranging between 10 and 50 {degrees}C. While temperature induced fluctuations should be monotonic, we observe a steady rise in the protein dynamics up to 40 {degrees}C, beyond which it surprisingly reverts back to the low temperature behaviour. Detailed investigation reveals disordering of the membrane lipids in the presence of the protein, which induces additional curvature around the transmembrane region. Coarse-grained simulations indicate temperature dependent aggregation of M protein dimers. Our study clearly indicates that the dynamics of membrane lipids and integral M protein of SARS-CoV-2 enables it to better associate and aggregate only at a certain temperature range (i.e., ~30 to 40 {degrees}C). This can have important implications in the protein aggregation and subsequent viral budding/fission processes.",

Here, we present an improved ISABEL trap that incorporates a near-infrared scatter illumination beam and rapidly interleaves 405 and 488 nm fluorescence excitation reporter beams. With the ISABEL trap, we monitor the internal redox environment of individual carboxysomes labeled with the ratiometric redox reporter roGFP2. Carboxysomes widely vary in scattering contrast (reporting on size) and redox-dependent ratiometric fluorescence. Further, we used redox sensing to explore the chemical kinetics within intact carboxysomes, where bulk measurements may contain unwanted contributions from aggregates or interfering fluorescent proteins.

Detecting biomolecular nanodynamics is therefore key to obtaining a mechanistic understanding of the energies and molecular driving forces that control biomolecular systems. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful technique to observe in real-time how a single biomolecule proceeds through its functional cycle involving a sequence of distinct structural states. Currently, this technique is fundamentally limited by irreversible photobleaching, causing the untimely end of the experiment and thus, a prohibitively narrow temporal bandwidth of [&le;] 3 orders of magnitude. Here, we introduce  DyeCycling, a measurement scheme with which we aim to break the photobleaching limit in single-molecule FRET. We introduce the concept of spontaneous dye replacement by simulations, and as an experimental proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the intermittent observation of a single biomolecule for one hour with a time resolution of milliseconds. Theoretically, DyeCycling can provide >100-fold more information per single molecule than conventional smFRET. We discuss the experimental implementation of DyeCycling, its current and fundamental limitations, and specific biological use cases. Given its general simplicity and versatility, DyeCycling has the potential to revolutionize the field of time-resolved smFRET, where it may serve to unravel a wealth of biomolecular dynamics by bridging from milliseconds to the hour range.",

The trajectories of this dynamic variation contribute to inter-individual behavioral differences and psychopathologic phenotypes. Despite many methodological advancements, the study of dynamic brain networks still relies on biased assumptions in the temporal domain. The current paper has two goals. First, we present a novel method to study multilayer networks: by modelling intra-nodal connections in a probabilistic, biologically driven way, we introduce a temporal resolution of the multilayer network based on signal similarity across time series. This new method is tested on synthetic networks by varying the number of modules and the sources of noise in the simulation. Secondly, we implement these probabilistically weighted (PW) multilayer networks to study the association between network dynamics and subclinical, psychosis-relevant personality traits in healthy adults. We show that the PW method for multilayer networks outperforms the standard procedure in modular detection and is less affected by increasing noise levels. Additionally, the PW method highlighted associations between the temporal instability of default mode network connections and psychosis-like experiences in healthy adults. PW multilayer networks allow an unbiased study of dynamic brain functioning and its behavioral correlates.",

However, the exclusion of high-motion participants may change the distribution of clinically relevant variables in the study sample, and the resulting sample may not be representative of the population. Our goals are two-fold: 1) to document the biases introduced by common motion exclusion practices in functional connectivity research and 2) to introduce a framework to address these biases by treating excluded scans as a missing data problem. We use a study of autism spectrum disorder in children without an intellectual disability to illustrate the problem and the potential solution. We aggregated data from 545 children (8-13 years old) who participated in resting-state fMRI studies at Kennedy Krieger Institute (173 autistic and 372 typically developing) between 2007 and 2020. We found that autistic children were more likely to be excluded than typically developing children, with 28.5% and 16.1% of autistic and typically developing children excluded, respectively, using a lenient criterion and 81.0% and 60.1% with a stricter criterion. The resulting sample of autistic children with usable data tended to be older, have milder social deficits, better motor control, and higher intellectual ability than the original sample. These measures were also related to functional connectivity strength among children with usable data. This suggests that the generalizability of previous studies reporting naive analyses (i.e., based only on participants with usable data) may be limited by the selection of older children with less severe clinical profiles because these children are better able to remain still during an rs-fMRI scan. We adapt doubly robust targeted minimum loss based estimation with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to address these data losses and the resulting biases. The proposed approach selects more edges that differ in functional connectivity between autistic and typically developing children than the naive approach, supporting this as a promising solution to improve the study of heterogeneous populations in which motion is common.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The combination of signals from different sensory modalities can enhance perception and facilitate behavioral responses. While previous research described crossmodal influences in a wide range of tasks, it remains unclear how such influences drive performance enhancements. In particular, the neural mechanisms underlying performance-relevant crossmodal influences, as well as the latency and spatial profile of such influences are not well understood. Here, we examined data from high-density electroencephalography (N = 30) and electrocorticography (N = 4) recordings to characterize the oscillatory signatures of crossmodal facilitation of response speed, as manifested in the speeding of visual responses by concurrent task-irrelevant auditory information. Using a data-driven analysis approach, we found that individual gains in response speed correlated with reduced beta power (13-25 Hz) in the audiovisual compared with the visual condition, starting within 80 ms after stimulus onset in multisensory association and secondary visual areas. In addition, the electrocorticography data revealed a beta power suppression in audiovisual compared with visual trials in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Our data suggest that the crossmodal facilitation of response speed is associated with early beta power in multisensory association and secondary visual areas, presumably reflecting the enhancement of early sensory processing through selective attention. This finding furthers our understanding of the neural correlates underlying crossmodal response speed facilitation and highlights the critical role of beta oscillations in mediating behaviorally relevant audiovisual processing.\n\nSignificance StatementThe use of complementary information across multiple senses can enhance perception. Previous research established a central role of neuronal oscillations in multisensory perception, but it remains poorly understood how they relate to multisensory performance enhancement. To address this question, we recorded electrophysiological signals from scalp and intracranial electrodes (implanted for presurgical monitoring) in response to simple visual and audiovisual stimuli. We then associated the difference in oscillatory power between the two conditions with the speeding of responses in the audiovisual trials. We demonstrate, that the crossmodal facilitation of response speed is associated with beta power in multisensory association areas during early stages of sensory processing. This finding highlights the importance of beta oscillations in mediating behaviorally relevant audiovisual processing.",

Mitochondrial genomes represent a single genetic marker likely to yield phylogenetic trees presenting incongruences with species trees, and transcriptomes can only be obtained from well-preserved samples. In contrast, ultraconserved elements (UCEs) include a great many independent markers that can be retrieved from poorly preserved samples. Here, we designed termite-specific baits targeting 50,616 UCE loci. We tested our UCE bait set on 42 samples of termites and three samples of Cryptocercus, for which we generated low-coverage highly-fragmented genome assemblies and successfully extracted in silico between 3,426 to 42,860 non-duplicated UCEs per sample. Our maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, reconstructed using the 5,934 UCE loci retrieved from upward of 75% of samples, was congruent with transcriptome-based phylogenies, demonstrating that our UCE bait set is reliable and phylogenetically informative. Combined with non-destructive DNA extraction protocols, our UCE bait set provides the tool needed to carry out a global taxonomic revision of termites based on poorly preserved specimens such as old museum samples.

Mitochondria provide fuel, metabolites, and ATP during different phases of the cell cycle, however it is not completely understood how mitochondrial function and the cell cycle are coordinated. CLUH is a post-transcriptional regulator of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and several metabolic pathways. Here, we show a role of CLUH in regulating the expression of astrin, which is involved in metaphase to anaphase progression, centrosome integrity, and mTORC1 inhibition. We find that CLUH binds both the SPAG5 mRNA and its product astrin, and controls the synthesis and the stability of the full-length astrin-1 isoform. We show that CLUH interacts with astrin-1 specifically during interphase. Astrin-depleted cells show mTORC1 hyperactivation and enhanced anabolism. On the other hand, cells lacking CLUH show decreased astrin levels and increased mTORC1 signaling, but cannot sustain anaplerotic and anabolic pathways. In absence of CLUH, cells fail to grow during G1, and progress faster through the cell cycle, indicating dysregulated matching of growth, metabolism and cell cycling. Our data reveal a role of CLUH in coupling growth signaling pathways and mitochondrial metabolism with cell cycle progression.",

Here, we aimed to identify IBD-specific or phenotype-specific genomic functions of diverse E. coli lineages.\n\nDesignWe investigated E. coli from patients with UC, CD and a pouch and healthy subjects. The majority of E. coli genomes were reconstructed directly from metagenomic samples, including publicly available and newly sequenced fecal metagenomes. Clinical metadata and biomarkers were collected. Functional analysis at the gene and mutation level and genome replication rates of E. coli strains were performed, and correlated with IBD phenotypes and biomarkers.\n\nResultsOverall, 530 E. coli genomes were analysed. A specific E. coli lineage (B2) was more prevalent in UC compared to other IBD phenotypes. Genomic metabolic capacities varied across E. coli lineages and IBD phenotypes. Specifically, sialidases involved in host mucin utilization, were exclusively present in a single lineage and were depleted in patients with a pouch. In contrast, enzymes that hydrolyze inulin were enriched in patients with a pouch. E. coli from patients with UC were twice as likely to encode the genotoxic molecule colibactin than strains from patients with CD or pouch. Strikingly, patients with a pouch showed the highest E. coli growth rates, even in the presence of antibiotics. Fecal calprotectin did not correlate with the relative abundance of E. coli. Finally, we identified multiple IBD-specific loss-of function mutations in E. coli genes encoding for bacterial cell envelope and secretion components.\n\nConclusionThis study presents E. coli as a commensal species better adapted to the overly-active mucosal immune milieu in IBD, that may benefit from intestinal inflammation, rather than causing it. The evidence given here suggests adaptive evolution toward attenuated virulence in some E. coli strains, coupled with a rapid growth despite the presence of antibiotics.",

Genome assemblies from long-read sequences are particularly exciting for understanding the evolution of complex genomic regions that are often difficult to assemble. In this study, we leveraged long-read sequencing data to generate a high-quality genome assembly for an Antarctic eelpout, Opthalmolycus amberensis, the first for the globally distributed family Zoarcidae. We used this assembly to understand how O. amberensis has adapted to the harsh Southern Ocean and compared it to another group of Antarctic fishes: the notothenioids. We showed that selection has largely acted on different targets in eelpouts relative to notothenioids. However, we did find some overlap; in both groups, genes involved in membrane structure, thermal tolerance, and vision have evidence of selection. We found evidence for historical shifts of transposable element activity in O. amberensis and other polar fishes, perhaps reflecting a response to environmental change. We were specifically interested in the evolution of two complex genomic loci known to underlie key adaptations to polar seas: hemoglobin and antifreeze proteins (AFPs). We observed unique evolution of the hemoglobin MN cluster in eelpouts and related fishes in the suborder Zoarcoidei relative to other Perciformes. For AFPs, we identified the first species in the suborder with no evidence of afpIII sequences (Cebidichthys violaceus) in the genomic region where they are found in all other Zoarcoidei, potentially reflecting a lineage-specific loss of this cluster. Beyond polar fishes, our results highlight the power of long-read sequencing to understand genome evolution.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Humans rely heavily on the shape of objects to recognise them. Recently, it has been argued that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can also show a shape-bias, provided their learning environment contains this bias. This has led to the proposal that CNNs provide good mechanistic models of shape-bias and, more generally, human visual processing. However, it is also possible that humans and CNNs show a shape-bias for very different reasons, namely, shape-bias in humans may be a consequence of architectural and cognitive constraints whereas CNNs show a shape-bias as a consequence of learning the statistics of the environment. We investigated this question by exploring shape-bias in humans and CNNs when they learn in a novel environment. We observed that, in this new environment, humans (i) focused on shape and overlooked many non-shape features, even when non-shape features were more diagnostic, (ii) learned based on only one out of multiple predictive features, and (iii) failed to learn when global features, such as shape, were absent. This behaviour contrasted with the predictions of a statistical inference model with no priors, showing the strong role that shape-bias plays in human feature selection. It also contrasted with CNNs that (i) preferred to categorise objects based on non-shape features, and (ii) increased reliance on these non-shape features as they became more predictive. This was the case even when the CNN was pre-trained to have a shape-bias and the convolutional backbone was frozen. These results suggest that shape-bias has a different source in humans and CNNs: while learning in CNNs is driven by the statistical properties of the environment, humans are highly constrained by their previous biases, which suggests that cognitive constraints play a key role in how humans learn to recognise novel objects.\n\nAuthor summaryAny object consists of hundreds of visual features that can be used to recognise it. How do humans select which feature to use? Do we always choose features that are best at predicting the object? In a series of experiments using carefully designed stimuli, we find that humans frequently ignore many features that are clearly visible and highly predictive. This behaviour is statistically inefficient and we show that it contrasts with statistical inference models such as state-of-the-art neural networks. Unlike humans, these models learn to rely on the most predictive feature when trained on the same data. We argue that the reason underlying human behaviour may be a bias to look for features that are less hungry for cognitive resources and generalise better to novel instances. Models that incorporate cognitive constraints may not only allow us to better understand human vision but also help us develop machine learning models that are more robust to changes in incidental features of objects.",

The kinome regulates numerous cell processes including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition to aberrant expression, aberrant alternative splicing of cancer-driver genes is receiving increased attention as it could create loss or gain of functional domains, altering a kinases downstream effects.\n\nThe present study quantifies changes in gene expression and isoform ratios in the kinome of metastatic melanoma cells relative to primary tumors. We contrast 538 total kinases and 3042 known kinase isoforms between 103 primary tumor and 367 metastatic samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find strong evidence of differential expression (DE) at the gene level in 123 genes (23%). Additionally, of the 468 genes with alternative isoforms, 60 (13%) had differential isoform ratios (DIR). Notably, DE and DIR have little correlation; for instance, although DE highlights enrichment in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), DIR identifies altered splicing in non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Using exon junction mapping, we identify five examples of splicing events favored in metastatic samples.\n\nWe cluster isoform expression data and identify subgroups that correlate with genomic subtypes and anatomic tumor locations. Notably, distinct DE and DIR patterns separate samples with BRAF hotspot mutations and (N/K/H)RAS hotspot mutations, the latter of which lacks effective kinase inhibitor treatments. DE in RAS mutants concentrates in CMGC kinases (a group including cell cycle and splicing regulators) rather than RTKs as in BRAF mutants. Furthermore, isoforms in the RAS kinase subgroup show enrichment for cancer-related processes such as angiogenesis and cell migration.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundWolbachia is an endosymbiont bacterium generally found in about 40% of insects, including mosquitoes, but it is absent in Aedes aegypti which is an important vector of several arboviral diseases. The evidence that Wolbachia trans-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes lost their vectorial competence and became less capable of transmitting arboviruses to human hosts highlights the potential of using Wolbachia- based approaches for prevention and control of arboviral diseases. Recently, release of Wolbachia trans-infected Ae. aegypti has been deployed widely in many countries for the control of mosquito-borne viral diseases. Field surveillance and monitoring of Wolbachia presence in released mosquitoes is important for the success of these control programs. So far, a number of studies have reported the development of loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays to detect Wolbachia in mosquitoes, but the methods still have some specificity issues.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe describe here the development of a LAMP combined with the DNA strand displacement-based electrochemical sensor (BIOSENSOR) method to detect wAlbB Wolbachia in trans-infected Ae. aegypti. Our developed LAMP primers were more specific to wAlbB detection than those of the previous published ones if the assays were conducted with low-cost and non-specific detecting dyes. The detection capacity of our LAMP technique was 3.8 nM and the detection limit reduced to 2.16 fM when combined with the BIOSENSOR. Our study demonstrates that the BIOSENSOR can also be applied as a stand-alone method for detecting Wolbachia; and it showed high sensitivity when used with the crude DNA extracts of macerated mosquito samples without DNA purification.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results suggest that both LAMP and BIOSENSOR, either used in combination or stand-alone, are robust and sensitive. The methods have good potential for routine detection of Wolbachia in mosquitoes during field surveillance and monitoring of Wolbachia-based release programs, especially in countries with limited resources.\n\nAuthor SummaryMosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever are transmitted to humans mainly by the bites of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Controlling these diseases relies mostly on the use of insecticides, in which the efficiency has been reduced through development of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Wolbachia is the endosymbiotic bacteria that are naturally found in 40% of insects, including mosquitoes. The bacteria could protect their hosts from viral infections and could also cause sterility in host populations, therefore, providing an opportunity to use them for disease control. Application of a Wolbachia-based strategy needs simple, rapid and sensitive methods for detecting the bacteria in released mosquitoes. In this paper, we develop the combined methods of LAMP and BIOSENSORS for detecting wAlbB Wolbachia in mosquitoes. Our positive LAMP reaction can be visualized by color change from violet to blue at a sensitivity of [&ge;] 60 pg of genomic DNA. When used in combination with the BIOSENSOR method, the sensitivity increased a million fold without losing specificity. Our study indicates that both developed methods, either used in combination or stand-alone, are efficient and cost-effective, hence, it could be applied for routine surveys of Wolbachia in mosquito control programs that use Wolbachia-based approaches.",

To understand the intracellular signaling processes that generated this data, one or more causal protein kinases must be assigned to each phosphosite. However, limited knowledge of kinase specificity typically restricts assignments to a small subset of a kinome. Starting from a statistical model of a high-throughput, in vitro kinase-substrate assay, I have developed an approach to high-coverage, multi-label kinase-substrate assignment called IV-KAPhE (\"In vivo-Kinase Assignment for Phosphorylation Evidence\"). Tested on human data, IV-KAPhE outperforms other methods of similar scope. Such computational methods generally predict a densely connected kinase-substrate network, with most sites targeted by multiple kinases, pointing either to unaccounted-for biochemical constraints or significant cross-talk and signaling redundancy. I show that such predictions can potentially identify biased kinase-site misannotations within families of closely related kinase isoforms and they provide a robust basis for kinase activity analysis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Inflammasomes sense intrinsic and extrinsic danger signals to trigger inflammatory responses and pyroptotic cell death. Homotypic pyrin domain (PYD) interactions of inflammasome forming Nod-like receptors with the adaptor protein ASC mediate oligomerization into helical filamentous assemblies. These supramolecular organizing centers recruit and activate caspase-1, which results in IL-1{beta} family cytokine maturation and pyroptotic cell death. The molecular details of the critical step in signal transduction of inflammasome signaling, however, remain ill-defined. Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of the human NLRP3 PYD filament at 3.6 [A] resolution. We identify a unique pattern of highly polar interface residues that form the homomeric interactions leading to characteristic filament ends that we designate as A- and B-end, respectively. Coupling a titration polymerization assay to cryo-EM, we demonstrate that the ASC adaptor protein elongation on NLRP3 PYD filament seeds is unidirectional, associating exclusively to the B-end of the NLRP3 filament. Notably, NLRP3 and ASC PYD filaments exhibit the same symmetry in rotation and axial rise per subunit, allowing for a continuous transition between NLRP3 as the nucleation seed and ASC as the elongator. Integrating the directionality of filament growth, we present a molecular model of the ASC speck consisting of active NLRP3-NEK7, ASC, and Caspase-1 proteins.",

The TRAPP complexes activate these GTPases via nucleotide exchange using a shared set of core subunits. The basal specificity of the TRAPP core is towards Rab1, yet the TRAPPII complex is specific for Rab11. A steric gating mechanism has been proposed to explain TRAPPII counterselection against Rab1. Here we present cryoEM structures of the 22-subunit TRAPPII complex from budding yeast, including a TRAPPII-Rab11 nucleotide exchange intermediate. The Trs130 subunit provides a \"leg\" that positions the active site distal to the membrane surface, and this leg is required for steric gating. The related TRAPPIII complex is unable to activate Rab11 due to a repulsive interaction, which TRAPPII surmounts using the Trs120 subunit as a \"lid\" to enclose the active site. TRAPPII also adopts an open conformation enabling Rab11 to access and exit from the active site chamber.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Growing concerns about microbial antibiotic resistance have motivated extensive research into ways of overcoming antibiotic resistance. Quorum quenching (QQ) processes disrupt bacterial communication via quorum sensing, which enables bacteria to sense the surrounding bacterial cell density and markedly affects their virulence. Due to its indirect mode of action, QQ is believed to exert limited pressure on essential bacterial functions and may thus avoid inducing resistance. Although many enzymes display QQ activity against various bacterial signaling molecules, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood, limiting their potential optimization as QQ agents. Here we evaluate the capacity of three N-terminal serine hydrolases to degrade N-acyl homoserine lactones that serve as signaling compounds for Gram-negative bacteria. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the free enzymes and their complexes with two signaling molecules of different lengths, followed by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations of their initial catalytic steps, we clarify the molecular processes underpinning their QQ activity. We conclude that all three enzymes degrade bacterial signaling molecules via similar reaction mechanisms. Moreover, we experimentally confirmed the activity of two penicillin G acylases from Escherichia coli (ecPGA) and Achromobacter spp. (aPGA), adding these biotechnologically well-optimized enzymes to the QQ toolbox. We also observed enzyme- and substrate-dependent differences in the catalytic actions of these enzymes, arising primarily from the distinct structures of their acyl-binding cavities and the dynamics of their molecular gates. As a consequence, the first reaction step catalyzed by ecPGA with a longer substrate had an elevated energy barrier because its shallow acyl binding site could not accommodate a productive substrate-binding configuration. Conversely, aPGA in complex with both substrates exhibited unfavorable energetics in both reaction steps due to the dynamics of the residues gating the acyl binding cavity entrance. Finally, the energy barriers of the second reaction step catalyzed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa acyl-homoserine lactone acylase with both substrates were higher than in the other two enzymes due to the unique positioning of Arg297{beta} in this enzyme. The discovery of these dynamic determinants will guide future efforts to design robust QQ agents capable of selectively controlling virulence in resistant bacterial species.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Columnaris disease is an emerging disease affecting farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) globally. In aquaculture breeding, genomic selection has been increasingly used to improve traits that are difficult to measure on candidate fish (such as disease resistance traits). Following a natural outbreak of columnaris disease, 3,054 exposed fish and their 81 parents (33 dams and 48 sires) were genotyped with the 57K SNP Axiom trout genotyping array. Genetic parameters of host resistance (measured as a binary survival trait) were estimated, a genome wide association study was performed, and the accuracy of pedigree-based and genomic prediction was estimated. After quality controls, 2,874 challenged fish (1,403 dead fish and 1,471 alive fish) and 78 parents genotyped for 27,907 SNPs remained. Pedigree based heritability was estimated to be 0.18 and 0.35 on the observed and underlying scale, respectively. Genomic heritability was estimated to be 0.21 and 0.43 on the observed and underlying scale, respectively. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) was detected on chromosome Omy3, significant at the genome-wide level, along with several suggestive QTLs on two other chromosomes. The additive effect on mortality proportion of the peak SNP from Omy3 was estimated to be 0.11 (0.018; se). Pedigree-based prediction accuracy was 0.59, and the use of genomic evaluation increased the prediction accuracy by at least 13.6%. Using the second iteration of a weighted genomic-based evaluation increased the prediction accuracy by 18.6% compared to the pedigree-based model. These results suggest that resistance is a suitable target trait for genetic improvement by selective breeding, and genomic selection may be a useful approach to speed up this process.",

    "preprint_abstract": "With the advent of wearable technologies, Human Body Communication (HBC) has emerged as a physically secure and power-efficient alternative to the otherwise ubiquitous Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). Whereas the most investigated nodes of HBC have been Electric and Electro-quasistatic (EQS) Capacitive and Galvanic, recently Magnetic HBC (M-HBC) has been proposed as a viable alternative. Previous works have investigated M-HBC through an application point of view, without developing a fundamental working principle for the same. In this paper, for the first time, a ground up analysis has been performed to study the possible effects and contributions of the human body channel in M-HBC over a broad frequency range (1kHz to 10 GHz), by detailed electromagnetic simulations and supporting experiments. The results show that while M-HBC can be successfully operated as a body area network, the human body itself plays a minimal or negligible role in its functionality. For frequencies less than[~] 30 Hz, in the domain of operation of Magneto-quasistatic (MQS) HBC, the human body is transparent to the quasistatic magnetic field. Conversely for higher frequencies, the conductive nature of human tissues end up attenuating Magnetic HBC fields due to Eddy currents induced in body tissues, eliminating the possibility of the body to support efficient waveguide modes. With this better understanding at hand, different modes of operations of MQS HBC have been outlined for both high impedance capacitive and 50{Omega} termination cases, and their performances have been compared with EQS HBC for similar sized devices, over varying distance between TX and RX. The resulting report presents the first fundamental understanding towards M-HBC operation and its contrast with EQS HBC, aiding HBC device designers to make educated design decisions, depending on mode of applications.",

We have also identified a substantial number of genes that changed dramatically in the double KO cells but did not significantly change in the single KO cells.

During this experimental B. rossi study we investigated inflammatory marker and cytokine kinetics during infection and after treatment. We aimed to determine whether infectious dose and treatment would influence the progression of the inflammatory response and clinical disease. Five healthy male beagle dogs were infected with B. rossi, three with a high infectious dose (HD group) and two with a low infectious dose (LD group). Clinical examination, complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined daily. Cytokines were quantified on stored plasma collected during the study, using a canine specific cytokine magnetic bead panel (Milliplex(C)). The experiment was terminated when predetermined endpoints were reached. Parasitemia occurred on day 1 and 3 in the HD group and LD group respectively. The rate of increase in parasitemia in the HD group was significantly faster than that seen in the LD group. Significant differences were found in heart rate, blood pressure, interferon gamma (INF{gamma}), keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), INF{gamma}-induced protein 10 (IP10), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10 IL-15, IL-18, CRP, neutrophils and monocytes between groups at multiple time points during the course of the infection. Our findings suggest that the initiation of inflammation occurs before the onset of clinical disease in B. rossi infection and infectious dose influences the onset of the inflammatory response. Treatment not only fails to curb the inflammatory response but may enhance it. Finally, we found that there is an imbalance in pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations during infection which may promote parasite replication.",

Thymic T-cell export continues into adulthood, yet the impact of thymic involution on the quality of newly generated T-cell clones is not well established. Notably, the number and proportion of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and expression of tissue restricted antigens (TRAs) decline with age, suggesting the involuting thymus may not promote efficient central tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that the middle-aged thymic environment does not support rapid motility of medullary thymocytes, potentially diminishing their ability to scan antigen presenting cells that display the diverse self-antigens that induce central tolerance. Consistent with this possibility, thymic slice assays reveal that the middle-aged thymic environment does not support efficient negative selection or regulatory T cell (Treg) induction of thymocytes responsive to either TRAs or ubiquitous self-antigens. This decline in central tolerance is not universal, but instead impacts lower-avidity self-antigens that are either presented at low levels or bind to TCRs with moderate affinities. Additionally, the decline in thymic tolerance by middle-age is accompanied by both a reduction in mTECs and hematopoietic antigen presenting cell subsets that cooperate to drive central tolerance. Thus, age-associated changes in the thymic environment result in impaired central tolerance against moderate avidity self-antigens, potentially resulting in export of increasingly autoreactive naive T cells, with a deficit of Treg counterparts by middle age.",

    "preprint_abstract": "To swim up gradients of nutrients, E. coli senses nutrient concentrations within its periplasm. For small nutrient molecules, periplasmic concentrations typically match extracellular concentrations. However, this is not necessarily the case for saccharides, such as maltose, which is transported into the periplasm via a specific porin. Previous observations have shown that under various conditions E. coli limits maltoporin abundance so that, for extracellular micromolar concentrations of maltose, there are predicted to be only nanomolar concentrations of free maltose in the periplasm. Thus, in the micromolar regime, the total uptake of maltose from the external environment into the cytoplasm is limited not by the abundance of cytoplasmic transport proteins but by the abundance of maltoporins. Here we present results from experiments and modeling showing that this porin-limited transport enables E. coli to sense micromolar gradients of maltose despite having a high-affinity ABC transport system that is saturated at these micromolar levels. We used microfluidic assays to study chemotaxis of E. coli in various gradients of maltose and methyl-aspartate and leveraged our experimental observations to develop a mechanistic transport-and-sensing chemotaxis model. Incorporating this model into agent-based simulations, we discover a trade-off between uptake and sensing: although high-affinity transport enables higher uptake rates at low nutrient concentrations, it severely limits dynamic sensing range. We thus propose that E. coli may limit periplasmic uptake to increase its chemotactic sensitivity, enabling it to use maltose as an environmental cue.\n\nStatement of SignificanceBacterial chemotaxis is among the best-studied systems in biology and is paradigmatic of the mechanisms used by cells to link sensory inputs with regulated responses, thus providing insight into the ecological basis of cellular physiology. Here we present a mechanistic chemotaxis model that describes how the regulation of the transport of a sugar into and out of the cells periplasm affects the cells motile response to that sugar. Based on observations from population-level chemotaxis assays, we uncover an ecologically relevant trade-off between sensing and uptake. The general finding of this work is that, while high-affinity transport allows for higher uptake rates, it can severely limit the cells dynamic sensing range.",

Brief bouts (< 3 second) of event-related TDCS (er-TDCS) were applied over M1 or the cerebellum during movements for only one of these learning contexts.\n\nResultsWe show that when short duration stimulation is applied to the cerebellum and yoked to movement, only those reaching movements performed simultaneously with stimulation are selectively enhanced, whilst similar and interleaved movements are left unaffected. We found no evidence of improved adaptation following M1 er-TDCS, as participants displayed equivalent levels of error during both stimulated and unstimulated movements. Similarly, participants in the sham stimulation group adapted comparably during left and right-shift trials.\n\nConclusionsIt is proposed that the coupling of cerebellar stimulation and movement influences timing-dependent (i.e., Hebbian-like) mechanisms of plasticity to facilitate enhanced learning in the stimulated context.",

Transition from recent to remote memories seems to involve the reorganization of this circuitry, a process called systems consolidation that has been associated with time-dependent fear generalization. However, it is unknown whether emotional memories acquired under different stress levels can undergo different systems consolidation processes. Here, we explored the activation pattern and functional connectivity of key brain regions associated with contextual fear conditioning (CFC) retrieval after recent (2 days) or remote (28 days) memory tests performed in rats submitted to strong (1.0mA footshock) or mild (0.3mA footshock) training. We used brain tissue from Wistar rats from a previous study, where we observed that increasing training intensity promotes fear memory generalization over time, possibly due to an increase in corticosterone (CORT) levels during memory consolidation. Analysis of Fos expression across 8 regions of interest (ROIs) allowed us to identify coactivation between them at both timepoints following memory recall. Our results showed that strong CFC elicits higher Fos activation in the anterior insular and prelimbic cortices during remote retrieval, which was positively correlated with freezing along with the basolateral amygdala. Rats trained either with mild or strong CFC showed broad functional connectivity at the recent timepoint whereas only animals submitted to the strong CFC showed a widespread loss of coactivation during remote retrieval. Post-training plasma CORT levels are positively correlated with FOS expression during recent retrieval in strong CFC, but negatively correlated with FOS expression during remote retrieval in mild CFC. Our findings suggest that increasing training intensity results in differential processes of systems consolidation, possibly associated with increased post-training CORT release, and that strong CFC engages activity from the aIC, BLA and PrL - areas associated with the Salience Network in rats - during remote retrieval.",

The dynamics of tumor formation is a very complex phenomenon due to multiple involved biochemical and biophysical processes.

We present a new theoretical framework of analyzing the cancer initiation dynamics by exploring the properties of effective free-energy landscape of the process. It is argued that although there are many possible pathways for the fixation of all mutations in the system, there are only few dominating pathways on the road to tumor formation. The theoretical approach is explicitly tested in the system with only two mutations using analytical calculations and Monte Carlo computer simulations. Excellent agreement with theoretical predictions is found for a large range of parameters, supporting our hypothesis and allowing us to better understand the mechanisms of cancer initiation.

While most HBs respond to chemotherapy and have favorable outcomes, the 3-year overall survival rate for high-risk HBs is below 50% and guidelines for their classification and treatment are still evolving. HB risk-stratification efforts using clinical, histological, and molecular parameters have been reported to help identify patients that require more or less aggressive therapies in retrospective studies, and are being validated in clinical trials. However, risk assessment is particularly challenging for cancers with certain histologies, including tumors in the recently proposed provisional hepatocellular neoplasm not otherwise specified (HCN NOS) category. HCN NOSs exhibit either intermediate or combined HB and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) histological features, and while neoplasms with such features were observed over a decade ago, only a handful have been characterized and little is known about their biology and clinical features. Here, we molecularly characterized a series of clinically annotated HCN NOSs that demonstrated either intermediate HB/HCC histology or distinct coexisting areas with HB and HCC histological features. In addition, molecular profiling of HBs demonstrating focal pleomorphism or anaplasia (HB FPA) revealed underlying biological features previously observed in HCCs. Our study suggested that HCN NOSs and HB FPAs are aggressive tumors, irrespective of patient age or resectability. Consequently, we designated them collectively as HBs with carcinoma features (HBCs) and outlined histological and molecular characteristics for their diagnosis and treatment. In our single-institution study, transplanted HBC patients were significantly and more than twice as likely to have good outcomes, highlighting the importance of molecular testing and aggressive early intervention.",

Although several advancements were made in the study of this modification by mass spectrometry, researchers still face the problem of a high false discovery rate. We present a dataset of high-quality methylations obtained from several different heavy methyl SILAC (hmSILAC) experiments analysed with a machine learning-based tool doublets and show that this model allows for improved high-confidence identification of real methyl-peptides. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that protein R methylation modulates protein:RNA interactions and suggest a role in rewiring protein:protein interactions, for which we provide experimental evidence for a representative case (i.e. NONO:PSPC1). Upon intersecting our R-methyl-sites dataset with a phosphosites dataset, we observed that R methylation correlates differently with S/T-Y phosphorylation in response to various stimuli. Finally, we explored the application of hmSILAC to identify unconventional methylated residues and successfully identified novel histone methylation marks on Serine 28 and Threonine 32 of H3.",

An important pro-survival adaptation is the ability of metastatic tumor cells to increase their antioxidant capacity and restore cellular redox balance. Although much is known about the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant enzymes in response to stress, how cells rapidly adapt to alter antioxidant enzyme levels is less well understood. Using ovarian cancer cells as a model, we demonstrate that an increase in protein expression of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2 is a very early event initiated in response to cellular detachment. SOD2 protein synthesis is rapidly induced within 0.5-2 hours of matrix detachment, and polyribosome profiling demonstrates an increase in the number of ribosomes bound to SOD2 mRNA, indicating an increase in SOD2 translation in response to anchorage-independence. Mechanistically, we find that anchorage-independence specifically induces cytosolic accumulation of the RNA binding protein HuR/ELAVL1 and leads to increased HuR binding to SOD2 mRNA. Using HuR siRNA-mediated knock-down, we show that the presence of HuR is necessary for the increase in SOD2 mRNA association with the heavy polyribosome fraction and SOD2 protein synthesis observed in anchorage-independence. Cellular detachment activates the stress-response protein kinase p38 MAPK, which is necessary for HuR-SOD2 mRNA binding and optimal increases in SOD2 protein expression. These findings illustrate a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of SOD2, enabling cells to rapidly increase their mitochondrial antioxidant capacity as an acute response to anchorage-independence.",

We observed stiff hydrogel encapsulation led to an absence of certain renal cell types and signs of an epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas encapsulation in soft-stress-relaxing hydrogels led to all major renal segments, fewer fibrosis/EMT associated proteins, apical proximal tubule enrichment, and primary cilia formation, representing a significant improvement over current approaches to culture kidney organoids.

Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have found diversity of microglia both across different stages and within the same stage in the developing brain. However, how such diversity is controlled during development is poorly understood. In this study, we first found the expression of the macrophage mannose receptor CD206 in early-stage embryonic microglia on mouse brain sections. This expression showed a sharp decline between E12.5 and E13.5 across the central nervous system. We next tested the roles of the microglia-expressed zinc finger transcription factor SALL1 in this early transition of gene expression. By deleting Sall1 specifically in microglia, we found that many microglia continued to express CD206 when it is normally downregulated. In addition, the mutant microglia continued to show less ramified morphology in comparison with controls even into postnatal stages. Thus, SALL1 is required for early microglia to transition into a more mature status during development.",

However, a systematic characterization and comparison of microbial communities in the GIT of cattle housed in different management units on a modern dairy are still lacking. In this study, we used 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the fecal bacterial communities of 90 dairy cattle raised and housed in 12 clearly defined management units on a modern dairy farm. We found that -diversity differed between several pairs of management units, especially between the hutch calves (management unit 1) and the other units except post weaned heifers (management unit 2). Although {beta}-diversity revealed that most of the samples did not cluster according to their management unit membership except management unit 1, in which the samples grouped and separated from others, we observed three major clusters. Besides the hutch calves (management unit 1), most samples from the other 11 units formed two distinct clusters and the relative abundance of Patescibacteria might be the reason for the separation. Moreover, we identified 212 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with relative abundances > 0.1% in more than 10% of the total samples that had significantly different abundances in these units. Furthermore, we found that, as the calves aged, 19 ASVs that were exclusively detected in unit 1, gradually degraded and never reoccurred in other management units. Lastly, we recognized 181 pairs of interactions between 61 ASVs with possibly strong synergistic or antagonistic relationships. These results suggest the enteric microbial communities of dairy cattle housed in different management units are quite dynamic.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacterial communities of GIT are crucial for ruminants, such as dairy cattle since they contribute to not only the cattles physiology and health but also milk production and food safety that are closely related to human health. Both scientifically and agriculturally, it is necessary to have deep insights into the composition and changes of the bacteria on modern dairy farms. In this study, we provided the profiles of fecal bacterial communities of dairy cattle in each management unit on a modern dairy and described how the enteric microbial communities changed across these management units. The findings have implications for improving animal health, dairy production, farm management, and food safety.",

With an ever-increasing acreage of croplands with suboptimal available soil phosphorus, genetic improvement of sorghum germplasm for enhanced phosphorus acquisition from soil is crucial to increasing agricultural output and reducing inputs, while confronted with a growing world population and uncertain climate. Sorghum bicolor is a globally important commodity for food, fodder, and forage. Known for robust tolerance to heat, drought, and other abiotic stresses, its capacity for optimal phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) is still being investigated for optimized root system architectures (RSA). Whilst a few RSA-influencing genes have been identified in sorghum and other grasses, the epigenetic impact on expression and tissue-specific activation of candidate PUE genes remains elusive. Here, we present transcriptomic, epigenetic, and regulatory network profiling of RSA modulation in the BTx623 sorghum background in response to limiting phosphorus (LP) conditions. We show that during LP, sorghum RSA is remodeled to increase root length and surface area, likely enhancing its ability to acquire P. Global DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels decrease in response to LP, while H3K4me3 peaks and DNA hypomethylated regions contain recognition motifs of numerous developmental and nutrient responsive transcription factors that display disparate expression patterns between different root tissues (primary root apex, elongation zone, and lateral root apex). Suggesting that epigenetic shifts during growth on LP results in targeted gene expression in a tissue-specific manner that optimizes the RSA for improved P uptake.\n\nSummaryIn response to low P, epigenetic and transcriptional changes stimulate lateral root growth in Sorghum bicolor BTx623, increasing the root surface area for enhanced \"mining\" of P from the soil.",

However, these profile less than 3% of DNA methylation sites in the human genome, potentially missing affected loci and preventing the discovery of disrupted biological pathways. Third generation sequencing technologies, including Nanopore sequencing, have the potential to revolutionise the generation of epigenetic data, not only by providing genuine genome-wide coverage but profiling epigenetic modifications direct from native DNA. Here we assess the viability of using Nanopore sequencing for epidemiology by performing a comparison with DNA methylation quantified using the most comprehensive microarray available, the Illumina EPIC array. We implemented a CRISPR-Cas9 targeted sequencing approach in concert with Nanopore sequencing to profile DNA methylation in three genomic regions to attempt to rediscover genomic positions that existing technologies have shown are differentially methylated in tobacco smokers. Using Nanopore sequencing reads, DNA methylation was quantified at 1,779 CpGs across three regions, providing a finer resolution of DNA methylation patterns compared to the EPIC array. The correlation of estimated levels of DNA methylation between platforms was high. Furthermore, we identified 12 CpGs where hypomethylation was significantly associated with smoking status, including 10 within the AHRR gene. In summary, Nanopore sequencing is a valid option for identifying genomic loci where large differences in DNAm are associated with a phenotype and has the potential to advance our understanding of the role differential methylation plays in the aetiology of complex disease.",

However, the significant site effects, observed in the imaging data and their derived structural and functional features, has prevented the derivation of consistent findings across different studies. The development of harmonization methods that can effectively eliminate complex site effects while maintaining biological characteristics in neuroimaging data has become a vital and urgent requirement for multisite imaging studies. Here, we proposed a deep learning-based framework to harmonize imaging data from pairs of sites, in which site factors and brain features can be disentangled and encoded. We trained the proposed framework with a publicly available traveling-subject dataset from SRPBS and harmonized the gray matter volume maps from eight source sites to a target site. The proposed framework significantly eliminated inter-site differences in gray matter volume. The embedded encoders successfully captured both the abstract texture of site factors and the concrete brain features. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibited outstanding performance relative to conventional statistical harmonization methods in site effect removal, data distribution homogenization, and intra-subject similarity improvement. Together, the proposed method offers a powerful and interpretable deep learning-based harmonization framework for multisite neuroimaging data that could enhance reliability and reproducibility in multisite studies for brain development and brain disorders.",

Controlling selective microbial biosynthesis of these target molecules at high efficiency is challenging due to enzyme promiscuity, regulation, and metabolic burden. In this study, we present a systematic modular design approach to control proteome reallocation for selective microbial biosynthesis of branched-chain acetate esters. Through pathway modularization, we partitioned the branched-chain ester pathways into four submodules including keto-isovalerate submodule for converting pyruvate to keto-isovalerate, ketoacid elongation submodule for producing longer carbon-chain keto-acids, ketoacid decarboxylase submodule for converting ketoacids to alcohols, and alcohol acyltransferase submodule for producing branched-chain acetate esters by condensing alcohols and acetyl-CoA. By systematic manipulation of pathway gene replication and transcription, enzyme specificity of the first committed steps of these submodules, and downstream competing pathways, we demonstrated selective microbial production of isoamyl acetate over isobutyl acetate. We found that the optimized isoamyl acetate pathway globally redistributed the amino acid fractions in the proteomes and required up to 23-31% proteome reallocation at the expense of other cellular resources, such as those required to generate precursor metabolites and energy for growth and amino acid biosynthesis. The engineered strains produced isoamyl acetate at a titer of 8.8 g/L (> 0.25 g/L toxicity limit), a yield of 0.17 g/g (47% of maximal theoretical value), and 86% selectivity, achieving the highest titers, yields and selectivity of isoamyl acetate reported to date.",

Nonetheless, many questions remain about their effectiveness to prevent the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Most surveillance studies monitor the levels and removal of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in intracellular DNA (iDNA) extracted from WWTP influents and effluents. The role of extracellular free DNA (exDNA) in wastewater is mostly overlooked. In this study, we analyzed the transfer of ARGs and MGEs in a full-scale Nereda(R) reactor removing nutrients with aerobic granular sludge. We tracked the composition and fate of the iDNA and exDNA pools of influent, sludge, and effluent samples. Metagenomics was used to profile the microbiome, resistome, and mobilome signatures of iDNA and exDNA extracts. Selected ARGs and MGEs were analyzed by qPCR. From 2,840 ARGs identified, the genes arr-3 (2%), tetC (1.6%), sul1 (1.5%), oqxB (1.2%), and aph(3\")-Ib (1.2%) were the most abundant among all sampling points and bioaggregates. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Acidovorax, Rhodoferax, and Streptomyces populations were the main hosts of ARGs in the sludge. In the effluent, 478 resistance determinants were detected, of which 89% from exDNA potentially released by cell lysis during aeration in the reactor. MGEs and multiple ARGs were co-localized on the same extracellular genetic contigs. These can pose a risk for AMR dissemination by transformation into microorganisms of receiving water bodies. Total intracellular ARGs decreased 3-42% as a result of wastewater treatment. However, the ermB and sul1 genes increased by 2 and 1 log gene copies mL-1, respectively, in exDNA from influent to effluent. The exDNA fractions need to be considered in AMR surveillance, risk assessment, and mitigation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482492v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5eedcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4da78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c324bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a18138_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA DNA database from an AGS reactor was constructed to study the system resistome, mobilome, and microbiome.\nC_LIO_LIThe genera Pseudomonas and Rhodoferax were the predominant ARG carriers in the system.\nC_LIO_LIMGEs and ARGs often co-localize on contigs recovered from the exDNA of the effluent.\nC_LIO_LIAGS plants are efficient at reducing ARB.\nC_LIO_LIThe exDNA is an underestimated DNA fraction containing ARGs in the effluent.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a detrimental premature aging disease caused by a point mutation in the human LMNA gene. This mutation results in the abnormal accumulation of a truncated pre-lamin A protein called progerin. Among the drastically accelerated signs of aging in HGPS patients, severe skin phenotypes such as alopecia and sclerotic skins always develop with the disease progression. Here, we study the HGPS molecular mechanisms focusing on early skin development by differentiating patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to a keratinocyte lineage. Interestingly, HGPS iPSCs showed an accelerated commitment to the keratinocyte lineage than the normal control. To study potential signaling pathways that accelerated skin development in HGPS, we investigated the WNT pathway components during HGPS iPSCs-keratinocytes induction. Surprisingly, despite the unaffected {beta}-catenin activity, the expression of a critical WNT transcription factor LEF1 was diminished from an early stage in HGPS iPSCs-keratinocytes differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment further revealed strong bindings of LEF1 to the early-stage epithelial developmental markers K8 and K18 and that the LEF1 silencing by siRNA down-regulates the K8/K18 transcription. During the iPSCs-keratinocytes differentiation, correction of HGPS mutation by Adenine base editing (ABE), while in a partial level, rescued the phenotypes for accelerated keratinocyte lineage-commitment. ABE also reduced the cell death in HGPS iPSCs-derived keratinocytes. These findings brought new insight into the molecular basis and therapeutic application for the skin abnormalities in HGPS.",

They originate in the yolk sac, colonize the CNS during embryonic development and form a self-sustaining population with limited turnover. A consequence of their relative slow turnover is that microglia can serve as a long-term memory for inflammatory or neurodegenerative events. We characterized the epigenomes and transcriptomes of microglia exposed to different stimuli; an endotoxin challenge (LPS) and genotoxic stress (DNA repair deficiency-induced accelerated aging). Whereas the enrichment of permissive epigenetic marks at enhancer regions explains training (hyperresponsiveness) of primed microglia to LPS challenge, the tolerized response of microglia seems to be regulated by loss of permissive epigenetic marks. Here, we identify that inflammatory stimuli and accelerated aging because of genotoxic stress activate distinct gene networks. These gene networks and associated biological processes are partially overlapping, which is likely driven by specific transcription factor networks, resulting in altered epigenetic signatures and distinct functional (desensitized vs. primed) microglia phenotypes.",

AD is more prevalent in women, while VCID is slightly more prevalent in men. Sex differences in risk factors may contribute to sex differences in dementia subtypes. Unlike metabolically healthy women, diabetic women are more likely to develop VCID than diabetic men. Prediabetes is 3x more prevalent than diabetes and is linked to earlier onset of dementia in women, but not men. How prediabetes influences underlying pathology and cognitive outcomes across different dementia subtypes is unknown. To fill this gap in knowledge, we investigated the impact of diet-induced prediabetes and biological sex on cognitive function and neuropathology in mouse models of AD and MxD. Male and female 3xTg-AD mice received a sham (AD model) or unilateral common carotid artery occlusion surgery to induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (MxD model). Mice were fed a control or high fat (HF; 60% fat) diet for 3 months prior to behavior assessment. In both sexes, HF diet elicited a prediabetic phenotype (impaired glucose tolerance) and weight gain. In females, but not males, metabolic consequences of a HF diet were more severe in AD or MxD mice compared to WT. In both sexes, HF-fed AD or MxD mice displayed deficits in spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM). In females, but not males, HF-fed AD and MxD mice also displayed impaired spatial learning in the MWM. In females, but not males, AD or MxD caused deficits in activities of daily living, regardless of diet. Astrogliosis was more severe in AD and MxD females compared to males. Further, HF diet caused greater accumulation of amyloid beta in MxD females compared to MxD males. In females, but not males, more severe glucose intolerance (prediabetes) was correlated with increased hippocampal microgliosis. In conclusion, high fat diet had a wider array of metabolic, cognitive, and neuropathological consequences in AD and MxD females compared to males. These findings shed light on potential underlying mechanisms by which prediabetes may lead to earlier dementia onset in women.\n\nHighlightsO_LICreated a mouse model of mixed dementia (MxD) with both AD + VCID pathology.\nC_LIO_LIHF diet caused greater metabolic impairment in AD and MxD females, compared to males.\nC_LIO_LIAD and MxD females showed a wider array of cognitive deficits, compared to males.\nC_LIO_LIAstrogliosis and A{beta} pathology were more severe in AD/MxD females, compared to males.\nC_LIO_LIMetabolic impairment was more consistently associated with reductions in cognitive function in females.\nC_LIO_LIMore severe glucose intolerance was associated with worse microgliosis in females only.\nC_LI",

Herein, we demonstrate that iSN40, an 18-base ODN derived from the Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG genome, promoted the differentiation and calcification of osteoblasts that play a central role during bone formation. In the murine osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1, iSN40 enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity at the early stage of differentiation and facilitated calcium deposition at the late stage by inducing the expression of osteogenic genes such as Msx2, osterix, collagen type 1, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. Intriguingly, the CpG motif within iSN40 was not required for its osteogenetic activity, indicating that iSN40 functions in a TLR9-independent manner.

    "preprint_abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder which results in deleterious changes to psychological and physical health. Patients with PTSD are especially susceptible to co-morbid inflammation-driven pathologies, such as autoimmunity, while also demonstrating increased T-helper 17 (TH17) lymphocyte-driven inflammation. While the exact mechanism of this increased inflammation is unknown, overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is a hallmark of PTSD. Neurotransmitters of the sympathetic nervous system (i.e., catecholamines) can alter T-lymphocyte function, which we have previously demonstrated to be partially mitochondrial redox-mediated. Furthermore, we have previously elucidated that T-lymphocytes generate their own catecholamines, and strong associations exist between tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines) and pro-inflammatory interleukin 17A (IL-17A) expression within purified T-lymphocytes in a preclinical rodent model of PTSD. Therefore, we hypothesized that T-lymphocyte-generated catecholamines drive TH17 T-lymphocyte polarization through a mitochondrial superoxide-dependent mechanism during psychological trauma. To test this, T-lymphocyte-specific TH knockout mice (THT-KO) were subjected to repeated social defeat stress (RSDS). RSDS characteristically increased tumor necrosis factor- (TNF), IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22, however, IL-17A and IL-22 (TH17 produced cytokines) were selectively attenuated in circulation and in T-lymphocytes of THT-KO animals. When activated ex vivo, secretion of IL-17A and IL-22 by THT-KO T-lymphocytes was also found to be reduced, but could be partially rescued with supplementation of norepinephrine specifically. Interestingly, THT-KO T-lymphocytes were still able to polarize to TH17 under exogenous polarizing conditions. Last, contrary to our hypothesis, we found RSDS-exposed THT-KO T-lymphocytes still displayed elevated mitochondrial superoxide, suggesting increased mitochondrial superoxide is upstream of T-lymphocyte TH induction, activity, and TH17 regulation. Overall, these data demonstrate TH in T-lymphocytes plays a critical role in RSDS-induced TH17 T-lymphocytes and offer a previously undescribed regulator of inflammation in RSDS.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) has emerged as a popular method for relating representational spaces from human brain activity, behavioral data, and computational models. RSA is based on the comparison of representational (dis-)similarity matrices (RDM or RSM), which characterize the pairwise (dis-)similarities of all conditions across all features (e.g. fMRI voxels or units of a model). However, classical RSA treats each feature as equally important. This  equal weights assumption contrasts with the flexibility of multivariate decoding, which reweights individual features for predicting a target variable. As a consequence, classical RSA may lead researchers to underestimate the correspondence between a model and a brain region and, in case of model comparison, may lead them to select an inferior model. The aim of this work is twofold: First, we sought to broadly test feature-reweighted RSA (FR-RSA) applied to computational models and reveal the extent to which reweighting model features improves RSM correspondence and affects model selection. Previous work suggested that reweighting can improve model selection in RSA but it has remained unclear to what extent these results generalize across datasets and data modalities. To draw more general conclusions, we utilized a range of publicly available datasets and three popular deep neural networks (DNNs). Second, we propose voxel-reweighted RSA, a novel use case of FR-RSA that reweights fMRI voxels, mirroring the rationale of multivariate decoding of optimally combining voxel activity patterns. We found that reweighting individual model units markedly improved the fit between model RSMs and target RSMs derived from several fMRI and behavioral datasets and affected model selection, highlighting the importance of considering FR-RSA. For voxel-reweighted RSA, improvements in RSM correspondence were even more pronounced, demonstrating the utility of this novel approach. We additionally show that classical noise ceilings can be exceeded when FR-RSA is applied and propose an updated approach for their computation. Taken together, our results broadly validate the use of FR-RSA for improving the fit between computational models, brain, and behavioral data, possibly allowing us to better adjudicate between competing computational models. Further, our results suggest that FR-RSA applied to brain measurement channels could become an important new method to assess the correspondence between representational spaces.",

For rs-fMRI analysis, the brain is typically parcellated into regions of interest (ROIs) and modelled as a graph where each ROI is a node and pairwise correlation between ROI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time series are edges. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have seen a surge in popularity due to their successes in modelling unstructured relational data. The latest developments with GNNs, however, have not yet been fully exploited for the analysis of rs-fMRI data, particularly with regards to its spatio-temporal dynamics. Herein we present a novel deep neural network architecture, combining both GNNs and temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), which is able to learn from the spatial and temporal components of rs-fMRI data in an end-to-end fashion. In particular, this corresponds to intra-feature learning (i.e., learning temporal dynamics with TCNs) as well as inter-feature learning (i.e., leveraging spatial interactions between ROIs with GNNs). We evaluate our model with an ablation study using 35,159 samples from the UK Biobank rs-fMRI database. We also demonstrate explainability features of our architecture which map to realistic neurobiological insights. We hope our model could lay the groundwork for future deep learning architectures focused on leveraging the inherently and inextricably spatio-temporal nature of rs-fMRI data.",

However, the structure basis and the molecular recognition mechanism of S9.6 to the nucleic acid substrates is still limited. Here, applying cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined a 4.9 [A] structure of S9.6 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) complexed with RNA:DNA hybrids. We found that the native Fab cleaved from S9.6 antibody has much higher affinity to RNA:DNA hybrids than to the double-strand RNAs, and the minimum length of the hybrids should be more than 8 base-pair. The structure of Fab binding to the hybrids suggested one loop of S9.6 heavy chain inserts into the minor groove in the RNA:DNA hybrids, and the other three loops flank to the hybrids. The top of four loop all enrich with aromatic or positive charge residues which are potentially responsible for nucleic acids binding specificity. Our results revealed the recognition mechanism of S9.6 on R-loops, which directs the future engineering of S9.6, and thus could further promote R-loop biology studies.",

Continuous advances in microscopic imaging and tracing software have provided an increasingly abundant availability of 3D reconstructions of arborizing dendrites, axons, and processes, allowing their detailed study. However, efficient, large-scale methods to rank neural morphologies by similarity to an archetype are still lacking. Using the NeuroMorpho.Org database, we present a similarity search software enabling fast morphological comparison of hundreds of thousands of neural reconstructions from any species, brain regions, cell types, and preparation protocols. We compared the performance of different morphological measurements: 1) summary morphometrics calculated by L-Measure, 2) persistence vectors, a vectorized descriptor of branching structure, 3) the combination of the two. In all cases, we also investigated the impact of applying dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). We assessed qualitative performance by gauging the ability to rank neurons in order of visual similarity. Moreover, we quantified information content by examining explained variance and benchmarked the ability to identify occasional duplicate reconstructions of the same specimen. The results indicate that combining summary morphometrics and persistence vectors with applied PCA provides an information rich characterization that enables efficient and precise comparison of neural morphology. The execution time scaled linearly with data set size, allowing seamless live searching through the entire NeuroMorpho.Org content in fractions of a second. We have deployed the similarity search function as an open-source online software tool both through a user-friendly graphical interface and as an API for programmatic access.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Comprehensive characterization of spatial and temporal gene expression patterns in humans is critical for uncovering regulatory codes of the human genome and understanding molecular mechanisms of human diseases. The ubiquitously expressed genes (UEGs) refer to those genes expressed across a majority, if not all, phenotypic and physiological conditions of an organism. It is known that many human genes are broadly expressed across tissues. However, most previous UEG studies have only focused on providing a list of UEGs without capturing their global expression patterns, thus limiting the potential use of UEG information. In this article, we propose a novel data-driven framework to leverage the extensive collection of [~]40,000 human transcriptomes to derive a list of UEGs and their corresponding global expression patterns, which offers a valuable resource to further validate and characterize human UEGs. Our results suggest that about half (12,234; 49.01%) of the human genes are expressed in at least 80% of human transcriptomes and the median size of the human transcriptome is 16,342 (65.44%). This suggests that the average difference in gene content between human transcriptomes is only 16.43%. Through gene clustering, we identified a set of UEGs, named LoVarUEGs, that have stable expression across human transcriptomes and can be used as internal reference genes for expression measurement. To further demonstrate the usefulness of this resource, we evaluated the uniqueness of repression for 16 previously predicted disallowed genes in islets beta cells and found that seven of these genes showed relatively more varied expression patterns, suggesting that the repression of these genes may not be unique to islets beta cells. We have made our resource publicly available at https://github.com/macroant/HumanUEGs.",

Here, we used a tumor transcriptome deconvolution approach to profile the metabolic states of cancer and non-cancer (stromal) cells in bulk tumors of 20 solid tumor types. We identified metabolic genes and processes recurrently altered in cancer cells across tumor types, including pan-cancer upregulation of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) production. In contrast, the tryptophan catabolism rate limiting enzymes, IDO1 and TDO2, were highly overexpressed in stroma, suggesting that kynurenine-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity is predominantly constrained by the stroma. Oxidative phosphorylation was unexpectedly the most upregulated metabolic process in cancer cells compared to both stromal cells and a large atlas of cancer cell lines, suggesting that the Warburg effect may be less pronounced in cancer cells in vivo. Overall, our analysis highlights fundamental differences in metabolic states of cancer and stromal cells inside tumors and establishes a pan-cancer resource to interrogate tumor metabolism.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The movement of fluid into, through, and out of the brain plays an important role in clearing metabolic waste. However, there is controversy regarding the mechanisms driving fluid movement, and whether the movement metabolic waste is primarily driven by diffusion or convection. The dilation of penetrating arterioles in the brain in response to increases in neural activity (neurovascular coupling) is an attractive candidate for driving fluid circulation, as it drives deformation of the brain tissue and of the paravascular space around arteries, resulting in fluid movement. We simulated the effects of vasodilation on fluid movement into and out of the brain using a novel poroelastic model of brain tissue. We found that arteriolar dilations could drive convective flow through the brain radially outward from the arteriole, and that this flow is sensitive to the dynamics of the dilation. Simulations of sleep-like conditions, with larger vasodilations and increased extracellular volume in the brain showed enhanced movement of fluid from the paravascular space into the brain. Our simulations suggest that both sensory-evoked and sleep-related arteriolar dilations can drive convective flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the paravascular space into the brain tissue around arterioles.",

While a limited number of recombinant protein therapies, such a Sargramostim, are approved for accelerating hematologic recovery, the pronounced role of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF or CSF2) as a proinflammatory cytokine poses additional challenges in creating immune dysfunction towards pathogenic autoimmune diseases. Here we present an approach to high-throughput drug-discovery, target validation, and lead molecule identification using nucleic acid-based molecules. These Nanoligomer molecules are rationally designed using a bioinformatics and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ranking method and synthesized as a single-modality combining 6-different design elements to up- or downregulate gene expression of target gene, resulting in elevated or diminished protein expression of intended target. This method additionally alters related gene network targets ultimately resulting in pathway modulation. This approach was used to perturb and identify the most effective upstream regulators and canonical pathways for therapeutic intervention to reverse radiation-induced immunosuppression. The lead Nanoligomer identified in a screen of human donor derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upregulated Erythropoietin (EPO) and showed the greatest reversal of radiation induced cytokine changes. It was further tested in vivo in a mouse radiation-model with low-dose (3 mg/kg) intraperitoneal administration and was shown to regulate gene expression of epo in lung tissue as well as counter immune suppression. These results point to the broader applicability of our approach towards drug-discovery, and potential for further investigation of lead molecule as reversible gene therapy to treat adverse health outcomes induced by radiation exposure.",

Twenty-three ADHD and 23 controls performed a delayed face-matching task with neutral faces that had either direct or averted gaze.

These results suggest brain impairments involving eye-gaze decoding in adults with ADHD, suggesting that neural deficits persist across the lifespan.",

Perceptual load theory states that attentional resources are allocated according to the requirements of the task, i.e. its  load. The theory predicts that the resources left to process irrelevant, possibly distracting stimuli, are reduced when the perceptual load is high. However, it remains unclear how this allocation of attentional resources specifically relates to neural excitability and suppression mechanisms. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we show that brain oscillations in the alpha band (8-13Hz) implement the suppression of distracting objects when the perceptual load is high. In parallel, high load increased neuronal excitability for target objects, as reflected by rapid frequency tagging. We suggest that the allocation of resources in tasks with high perceptual load is implemented by a gain increase for targets, complemented by distractor suppression reflected by alpha band oscillations closing the  gate for interference.",

We use PET and MRI data from 33 participants of Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI3) combined with frequency compositions of TVB-simulated local field potentials (LFP) for machine-learning classification.\n\nRESULTSThe combination of empirical neuroimaging features and simulated LFPs significantly outperformed the classification accuracy of empirical data alone by about 10% (weighted F1-score empirical 64.34% vs. combined 74.28%). Informative features showed high biological plausibility regarding the Alzheimers-typical spatial distribution.\n\nDISCUSSIONThe cause-and-effect implementation of local hyperexcitation caused by Amyloid {beta} can improve the machine-learning-driven classification of Alzheimers and demonstrates TVBs ability to decode information in empirical data employing connectivity-based brain simulation.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_LISYSTEMATIC REVIEW. Machine-learning has been proven to augment diagnostics of dementia in several ways. Imaging-based approaches enable early diagnostic predictions. However, individual projections of long-term outcome as well as differential diagnosis remain difficult, as the mechanisms behind the used classifying features often remain unclear. Mechanistic whole-brain models in synergy with powerful machine learning aim to close this gap.\nC_LIO_LIINTERPRETATION. Our work demonstrates that multi-scale brain simulations considering Amyloid {beta} distributions and cause-and-effect regulatory cascades reveal hidden electrophysiological processes that are not readily accessible through measurements in humans. We demonstrate that these simulation-inferred features hold the potential to improve diagnostic classification of Alzheimers disease.\nC_LIO_LIFUTURE DIRECTIONS.

These sub-micron particles are approximately 10x smaller than clinically available microbubbles. This allows them to effectively traverse compromised physiological barriers and circulate for extended periods of time. While various aspects of nanobubble behavior have been previously examined, their behavior in human whole blood has not yet been explored. Accordingly, herein we examined, for the first time, the short and long-term effects of blood components on nanobubble acoustic response. We observed differences in the kinetics of backscatter from nanobubble suspensions in whole blood compared to bubbles in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), plasma, or red blood cell solutions (RBCs). Specifically, after introducing nanobubbles to fresh human whole blood, signal enhancement gradually increased by 22.8 {+/-} 13.1% throughout our experiment, with peak intensity reached within 145 seconds. In contrast, nanobubbles in PBS had a stable signal with negligible change in intensity (-1.7 {+/-} 3.2%) over 8 minutes. Under the same conditions, microbubbles made with the same lipid formulation showed a -56.8 {+/-} 6.1% decrease in enhancement. Subsequent confocal, fluorescent, and scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed attachment of the nanobubbles to the surface of RBCs, suggesting that direct interactions, or hitchhiking, of nanobubbles on RBCs in the presence of plasma may be a possible mechanism for the observed effects. This phenomenon could be key to extending nanobubble circulation time and has broad implications in drug delivery, where RBC interaction with nanoparticles could be exploited to improve delivery efficiency.",

We examine how manipulation of Drosophila melanogaster microbiota affect aggression as well as the pathways that underly the behavior in this species.

Furthermore, they had higher levels of vCA and (Z)-9 Tricosene, pheromones associated with aggression in flies, as well as higher expression of the relevant pheromone receptors and transporters OR67d, OR83b, GR32a, and LUSH.

To enable systematic investigation of entire structured phenomes, we present graph embedded topic model (GETM). Our contributions are two folds in terms of method and applications. On the methodology side, we offer two main contributions in GETM. First, to aid topic inference, we integrate existing biomedical knowledge graph information in the form of pre-trained graph embedding into the embedded topic model. Second, leveraging deep learning techniques, we developed a variational autoencoder framework to infer patient phenotypic mixture by modeling multi-modal discrete patient medical records. In particular, for interpretability, we use a linear decoder to simultaneously infer the bi-modal distributions of the disease conditions and medications. On the application side, we applied GETM to UK Biobank (UKB) self-reported clinical phenotype data, which contains 443 self-reported medical conditions and 802 self-reported medications for 457,461 individuals. Compared to existing methods, GETM demonstrates overall superior performance in imputing missing conditions and medications. Here, we focused on characterizing pain phenotypes recorded in the questionnaire of the UKB individuals. GETM accurately predicts the status of chronic musculoskeletal (CMK) pain, chronic pain by body-site, and non-specific chronic pain using past conditions and medications. Our analyses revealed not only the known pain-related topics but also the surprising predominance of medications and conditions in the cardiovascular category among the most predictive topics across chronic pain phenotypes.",

Studies using synthetic data have shown that k-means performance is highly dependent on sliding window parameters and signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, sources of heterogeneity between subjects may affect the accuracy of group-level clustering, thus affecting measurements of dFC state temporal properties such as dwell time and fractional occupancy. This may result in spurious conclusions regarding differences between groups (e.g. when comparing a clinical population to healthy controls). Therefore, is it important to quantify the ability of k-means to estimate dFC state temporal properties when applied to cohorts of multiple subjects, and to explore ways in which clustering performance can be maximised.\n\nHere, we explore the use of dimensionality reduction methods prior to clustering in order to map high-dimensional data to a lower dimensional space, providing salient features to the subsequent clustering step. We assess the use of deep autoencoders for feature selection prior to applying k-means clustering to the encoded data. We compare this deep clustering method to feature selection using principle component analysis (PCA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), as well as applying k-means to the original feature space using either L1 or L2 distance. We provide extensive quantitative evaluation of clustering performance using synthetic datasets, representing data from multiple heterogeneous subjects. In synthetic data we find that deep clustering gives the best performance, while other approaches are often insufficient to capture temporal properties of dFC states. We then demonstrate the application of each method to real-world data from human subjects and show that the choice of feature selection method has a significant effect on group-level measurements of state temporal properties. We therefore advocate for the use of deep clustering as a precursor to clustering in dFC.",

Positioning of MNPs at the mucosal epithelial interface facilitates their access to luminally-derived antigens and may regulate MNP function through soluble mediators or surface receptor interactions. Therefore, accurately quantifying the distribution of MNPs within mucosal tissues as well as their spatial relationship with other cells is important to infer functional cellular interactions in health and disease. In this study, we developed and validated a MATLAB-based tissue cytometry platform, termed \"MNP mapping application\" (MNPmApp), that performs high throughput analyses of MNP density and distribution in the gastrointestinal mucosa based on digital multicolor fluorescence microscopy images and that integrates a Monte Carlo modeling feature to assess randomness of MNP distribution. MNPmApp identified MNPs in tissue sections of the human gastric mucosa with a specificity of 98.3 {+/-} 1.6% and a sensitivity of 76.4 {+/-} 15.1%. Monte Carlo modeling revealed that mean MNP-MNP distances were significantly lower than anticipated based on random cell placement, whereas MNP-epithelial distances did not significantly differ from those of randomly placed cells. Interestingly, H. pylori infection had no significant impact on MNP density or distribution with regards to MNP-epithelial distances or MNP-MNP distances in gastric tissue. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that MNPmApp is a useful tool for unbiased quantitation of MNPs and their distribution at mucosal sites.",

Passive eDNA collection is inexpensive, efficient, and requires minimal equipment, making it suited to high density sampling and remote deployment. Here, we compare the effectiveness of nine membrane materials for passively collecting fish eDNA from a 3 million litre marine mesocosm. We submerged materials (cellulose, cellulose with 1% and 3% chitosan, cellulose overlayed with electrospun nanofibers and 1% chitosan, cotton fibres, hemp fibres and sponge with either zeolite or active carbon) for intervals between five and 1080 minutes. We show that for most materials, with as little as five minutes submersion, mitochondrial fish eDNA measured with qPCR, and fish species richness measured with metabarcoding, was comparable to that collected by conventional filtering. Furthermore, PCR template DNA concentrations and species richness were generally not improved significantly by longer submersion. Species richness detected for all materials ranged between 11 to 37 species, with a median of 27, which was comparable to the range for filtered eDNA (19-32). Using scanning electron microscopy, we visualised biological matter adhered to the surface of materials, rather than entrapped, with images also revealing a diversity in size and structure of putative eDNA particles.\n\nEnvironmental DNA can be collected rapidly from seawater with a passive approach and using a variety of materials. This will suit cost and time-sensitive biological surveys, and where access to equipment is limited.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a class of highly negatively charged membrane associated and extracellular matrix polysaccharides involved in the regulation of myriad biological functions, including cell adhesion, migration, signaling and differentiation, among others. GAGs are typically attached to core proteins, termed proteoglycans (PGs), and can engage >500 binding proteins, making them prominent relays for sensing external stimuli and transducing cellular responses. However, their unique substructural protein-recognition domains that confer their binding specificity remain elusive. While the emergence of glycan arrays has rapidly enabled the profiling of ligand specificities of a range of glycan-binding proteins, their adaptation for the analysis of GAG-binding proteins has been considerably more challenging. Current GAG-microarrays primarily employ synthetically defined oligosaccharides, which capture only a fraction of the structural diversity of native GAG polysaccharides. Augmenting existing array platforms to include GAG structures purified from tissues or produced in cells with engineered glycan biosynthetic pathways may significantly advance the understanding of structure-activity relationships in GAG-protein interactions. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and tunable strategy to mimic cellular proteoglycan architectures by conjugating biologically-derived GAG chains to a protein scaffold, defined as neoproteoglycans (neoPGs). The use of a reactive fluorogenic linker enabled real-time monitoring of the conjugation reaction efficiency and tuning of the neoPG valency. Immobilization of the reagents on a 96-well array platform allowed for efficient probing of ligand binding and enzyme substrate specificity, including growth factors and the human sulfatase 1. The neoPGs can also be used directly as soluble probes to evaluate GAG-dependent growth factor signaling in cells.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482917v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a51f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f99e16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f9c5b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@242d9a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Statistical deconvolution of allele frequencies from shotgun metagenomic data into strain genotypes and relative abundances is a promising approach, but existing methods are limited by computational scalability. Here we introduce StrainFacts, a method for strain deconvolution that enables inference across tens of thousands of metagenomes. We harness a \"fuzzy\" genotype approximation that makes the underlying graphical model fully differentiable, unlike existing methods. This allows parameter estimates to be optimized with gradient-based methods, speeding up model fitting by two orders of magnitude. A GPU implementation provides additional scalability. Extensive simulations show that StrainFacts can perform strain inference on thousands of metagenomes and has comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive tools. We further validate our strain inferences using single-cell genomic sequencing from a human stool sample. Applying StrainFacts to a collection of more than 10,000 publicly available human stool metagenomes, we quantify patterns of strain diversity, biogeography, and linkage-disequilibrium that agree with and expand on what is known based on existing reference genomes. StrainFacts paves the way for large-scale biogeography and population genetic studies of microbiomes using metagenomic data.",

For each glycan input, our model produces 1257 outputs, each representing the relative interaction strength between the input glycan and a particular protein sample. GlyNet learns these continuous values using relative fluorescence units (RFUs) measured on 599 glycans in the Consortium for Functional Glycomics glycan arrays and extrapolates these to RFUs from additional, untested glycans. GlyNets output of continuous values provides more detailed results than classification models. Such continuous outputs are easily converted by a following classifier, and in this form GlyNet outperforms reported classifiers. GlyNet is the first multi-output regression model for protein-glycan interactions and will serve as an important benchmark, facilitating development of quantitative computational glycobiology.",

Bacteria, fungi, and terrestrial microalgae together form microbial communities, which in turn support more bark-associated organisms, such as mosses, lichens, and invertebrates, thus contributing to forest biodiversity. We have a limited understanding of the diversity and biotic interactions of the bark-associated microbiome, as investigations have mainly focussed on agriculturally relevant systems and on single taxonomic groups. Here we implemented a multi-kingdom metabarcoding approach to analyse diversity and community structure of the green algal, bacterial, and fungal components of the bark-associated microbial communities of beech, the most common broadleaved tree of Central European forests. We identified the most abundant taxa, hub taxa, and co-occurring taxa. We found that tree size (as a proxy for age) is an important driver of community assembly, suggesting that environmental filtering leads to less diverse fungal and algal communities over time. Conversely, forest management intensity had negligible effects on microbial communities on bark. Our study suggests the presence of undescribed, yet ecologically meaningful taxa, especially in the fungi, and highlights the importance of bark surfaces as a reservoir of microbial diversity. Our results constitute a first, essential step towards an integrated framework for understanding microbial community assembly processes on bark surfaces, an understudied habitat and neglected component of terrestrial biodiversity. Finally, we propose a cost-effective sampling strategy to study bark-associated microbial communities across large spatial or environmental scales.",

Previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that the affinity of polarizable anions to aqueous/hydrophobic interfaces can be markedly influenced by including polarization effects through an electronic continuum correction (ECC). Here, we designed a model biomimetic nanopore to imitate the polar pore openings and hydrophobic gating regions found in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. MD simulations were then performed using both a non-polarizable force field and the ECC method to investigate the behavior of water, Na+ and Cl- ions confined within the hydrophobic region of the nanopore. Number density distributions revealed preferential Cl- adsorption to the hydrophobic pore walls, with this interfacial layer largely devoid of Na+. Free energy profiles for Na+ and Cl- permeating the pore also display an energy barrier reduction associated with the localization of Cl- to this hydrophobic interface, and the hydration number profiles reflect a corresponding reduction in the first hydration shell of Cl-. Crucially, these ion effects were only observed through inclusion of effective polarization which therefore suggests that polarizability may be essential for an accurate description for the behavior of ions and water within hydrophobic nanoscale pores, especially those that conduct Cl-.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Intercropping, by capitalizing on positive biodiversity-productivity relationships, represents a promising option to increase agricultural sustainability. However, the complexity and context-dependency of plant-plant interactions can make it challenging for farmers to find suitable crop combinations. Furthermore, intercropping is usually implemented with standard inter-row spacing and plant densities based on monoculture practices, which might not be the ideal configuration to maximise yield. Therefore, here we present a spatially-explicit method based on plant ecological interaction models that allowed to optimize crop species combinations and spatial configurations for maximal yield in intercropped systems. We tested this method with three crop species, namely oat, lupin, and camelina. In a first step, field experiments in which crop density was varied provided us with indications on which species would compete more with each other. The results showed us that oat and camelina strongly competed with each other. In addition, the distance experiments allowed us to understand how the changes in yield associated with the presence of neighbours vary with distance. This allowed us to find the sets of parameters (identity of neighbours, sowing density, distances between individuals) that optimises intercrop yield (measured as Land Equivalent Ratio [LER]) for the three considered species. Specifically, we show that alternating rows of species led to higher LERs than a homogeneous species mixing. In addition, for each spatial configuration considered, we provide indications for the optimal inter- and intra-row distances and information about relative yield losses with suboptimal planting patterns. By modelling crop yield from simple and reproducible density and distance experiments, our results allow to optimize crop mixtures in terms of species combinations and spatial configurations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is one of the most prominent threats to modern medicine. In the latest World Health Organization list of bacterial pathogens that urgently require new antibiotics, nine out of 12 are Gram-negative, with four being of  Critical Priority. One crucial barrier restricting antibiotic efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria is their unique cell envelope. While fatty acids are a shared constituent of all structural membrane lipids, their biosynthesis pathway in bacteria is distinct from eukaryotes making it an attractive target for new antibiotic development that remains less explored. Here, we interrogated the redundant components of the bacterial Type II Fatty Acid Synthesis (FAS II) pathway, showing that disrupting FAS II homeostasis in Escherichia coli through deletion of the fabH gene damages the cell envelope of antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant clinical isolates. The fabH gene encodes the {beta}-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase III (KAS III), which catalyzes the initial condensation reactions during fatty acid biosynthesis. We show that fabH null mutation potentiated the killing of multi-drug resistant E. coli by a broad panel of previously ineffective antibiotics, despite the presence of relevant antibiotic resistance determinants, for example, carbapenemase kpc2. Enhanced antibiotic sensitivity was additionally demonstrated in the context of eradicating established biofilms and treating established human cell infection in vitro. Our findings showcase the potential of FabH as a promising target that could be further explored in the development of therapies that may repurpose currently ineffective antibiotics or rescue failing last-resort antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens.\n\nIMPORTANCEGram-negative pathogens are a major concern for global public health due to increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and the lack of new drugs. A major contributing factor towards antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is their formidable outer membrane, which acts as a permeability barrier preventing many biologically active antimicrobials from reaching the intracellular targets and thus limiting their efficacy. Fatty acids are the fundamental building blocks of structural membrane lipids and their synthesis constitutes an attractive antimicrobial target as it follows distinct pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Herein, we identified a component of fatty acid synthesis, FabH, as a  gate-keeper of outer membrane barrier function. Without FabH, Gram-negative bacteria become susceptible to otherwise impermeable antibiotics and are re-sensitised to killing by last-resort antibiotics. This study supports FabH as a promising target for inhibition in future antimicrobial therapies.",

A significant number of CVID patients are affected by various manifestations of immune dysregulation such as autoimmunity. Follicular T cells cells are thought to support the development of CVID by providing inappropriate signals to B cells during the germinal center (GC) response.\n\nObjectivesWe determined the possible role of follicular helper (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells in patients with CVID by phenotypic, molecular, and functional studies.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed the frequency, phenotype, transcriptome, and function of circulating Tfh cells in the peripheral blood of 27 CVID patients (11 pediatric and 16 adult) displaying autoimmunity as additional phenotype and compared them to 106 (39 pediatric and 67 adult) age-matched healthy controls. We applied Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing to identify mutations that could account for the development of CVID and associate with Tfh alterations.\n\nResultsA group of CVID patients (n=9) showed super-physiological frequency of Tfh1 cells and a prominent expression of PD-1 and ICOS, as well as a Tfh RNA signature consistent with highly active, but exhausted and apoptotic cells. Plasmatic CXCL13 levels were elevated in these patients and positively correlated with Tfh1 cell frequency, PD-1 levels, and an elevated frequency of CD21loCD38lo autoreactive B cells. Monoallelic variants in RTEL1, a telomere length- and DNA repair-related gene, were ideintified in four patients belonging to this group. Lymphocytes with highly shortened telomeres, and a Tfh signature enriched in genes involved in telomere elongation and response to DNA damage were seen. Histopathological analysis of the spleen in one patient showed reduced amount and size of the GC that, unexpectedly, contained an increased number of Tfh cells.\n\nConclusionThese data point toward a novel pathogenetic mechanism in a group of patients with CVID, whereby alterations in DNA repair and telomere elongation might be involved in GC B cells, and acquisition of a Th1, highly activated but exhausted and apoptotic phenotype by Tfh cells.",

The hippocampus is involved in sensorimotor behavior but has not been widely studied within the context of post-stroke upper limb sensorimotor impairment. The hippocampus is vulnerable to secondary degeneration after stroke, and damage to this region could further weaken sensorimotor circuits, leading to greater chronic sensorimotor impairment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional association between non-lesioned hippocampal volume and upper limb sensorimotor impairment in people with chronic stroke. We hypothesized that smaller ipsilesional hippocampal volumes would be associated with worse upper-limb sensorimotor impairment.\n\nCross-sectional T1-weighted brain MRIs were pooled from 357 participants at the chronic stage after stroke (>180 days post-stroke) compiled from 18 research cohorts worldwide in the ENIGMA Stroke Recovery Working Group (age: median = 61 years, interquartile range = 18, range = 23-93; 135 women and 222 men). Sensorimotor impairment was estimated from the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity scores. Robust mixed-effects linear models were used to test associations between post-stroke sensorimotor impairment and hippocampal volumes (ipsilesional and contralesional separately; Bonferroni-corrected, p-value < 0.025), controlling for age, sex, lesion volume, and lesioned hemisphere. We also performed an exploratory analysis to test whether sex differences influence the relationship between sensorimotor impairment and hippocampal volume.\n\nUpper limb sensorimotor impairment was positively associated with ipsilesional (p = 0.005; d = 0.33) but not contralesional (p = 0.96; d = 0.01) hippocampal volume, such that impairment was worse for participants with smaller ipsilesional hippocampal volume. This association remained significant independent of lesion volume or other covariates (p = 0.001; d = 0.36). Evidence indicates an interaction between sensorimotor impairment and sex for both ipsilesional (p = 0.008; d = -0.29) and contralesional (p = 0.006; d = -0.30) hippocampal volumes, whereby women showed progressively worsening sensorimotor impairment with smaller hippocampal volumes compared to men.\n\nThe present study has identified a novel association between chronic post-stroke sensorimotor impairment and ipsilesional, but not contralesional, hippocampal volume. This finding was not due to lesion size and may be stronger in women. We also provide supporting evidence that smaller hippocampal volume post-stroke is likely a consequence of ipsilesional damage, which could provide a link between vascular disease and other disorders, such as dementia.",

Understanding the fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms underlying addiction and related behaviors could facilitate more effective treatments. To explore how repeated drug exposure alters gene regulatory networks in the brain, we combined capped small (cs)RNA-seq, which accurately captures nascent-like initiating transcripts from total RNA, with Hi-C and single nuclei (sn)ATAC-seq. We profiled initiating transcripts in two addiction-related brain regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), from rats that were never exposed to drugs or were subjected to prolonged abstinence after oxycodone or cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Interrogating over 100,000 active transcription start regions (TSRs) revealed that most TSRs had hallmarks of bonafide enhancers and highlighted the KLF/SP1, RFX, and AP1 transcription factors families as central to establishing brain-specific gene regulatory programs. Analysis of rats with addiction-like behaviors versus controls identified addiction-associated repression of transcription at regulatory enhancers recognized by nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C (NR3C) factors, which include glucocorticoid receptors. Cell-type deconvolution analysis using snATAC-seq uncovered a potential role of glial cells in driving the gene regulatory programs associated with addiction-related phenotypes. These findings highlight the power of advanced transcriptomics methods to provide insight into how addiction perturbs gene regulatory programs in the brain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Soil salinity is an increasing worldwide problem for agriculture, affecting plant growth and yield. To understand the molecular mechanisms activated in response to salt in plants, we investigated the Catharanthus roseus Receptor like Kinase 1 Like (CrRLK1L) family, which contains well described sensors previously shown to be involved in maintaining and sensing the structural integrity of the cell walls. We found that herk1the1-4 double mutants, lacking the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana Receptor like Kinase HERKULES1 combined with a gain-of-function allele of THESEUS1, phenocopied the phenotypes previously reported in plants lacking FERONIA (FER) function. We report that both fer-4 and herk1the1-4 mutants respond strongly to salt application, resulting in a more intense activation of early and late stress responses. We also show that salt triggers de-methyl esterification of loosely bound pectins, responsible for the activation of several salt response signaling pathways. Addition of calcium chloride or chemically inhibiting pectin methyl esterase (PME) activity reduced activation of the early signaling protein Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 6 (MPK6) as well as amplitude of salt-induced marker gene induction. MPK6 is required for the full induction of the salt-induced gene expression markers we tested. The sodium specific root halotropism response on the other hand, appears independent of MPK6 or calcium application, and is only mildly influenced by the cell wall sensors FER/HERK1/THE1-4 or alteration of PME activity. We hypothesize a model where salt-triggered modification of pectin requires the functionality of FER alone or the HERK1/THE1 combination to attenuate salt responses. Collectively, our results show the complexity of salt stress responses and salt sensing mechanisms and their connection to cell wall modifications, responsible for several salt response pathways and ultimately plant resilience to salinity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Body size varies widely among species, populations, and individuals depending on the environment. Transitioning between proliferation and differentiation is a crucial determinant of final organ size, but how the timing of this transition is established and maintained remains unknown. Using cell proliferation markers and genetic analysis, we show that CHIQUITA1 (CHIQ1) is required to maintain the timing of the transition from proliferation to differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Combining kinematic and cell lineage tracking studies, we found that the number of actively dividing cells in chiquita1-1 plants decreases prematurely compared to wild type plants, suggesting CHIQ1 maintains the proliferative capacity in dividing cells and ensures that cells divide a certain number of times. CHIQ1 belongs to a plant-specific gene family of unknown molecular function and physically and genetically interacts with three close members of its family to control the timing of proliferation exit. Our work reveals the interdependency between cellular and organ-level processes underlying final organ size determination.\n\nSignificanceTiming of the transition between proliferation and differentiation is fundamental for determining the final size of organs and organisms. In agriculture, controlling organ and organism size can influence key agronomic traits such as yield and biomass. Dwarfism prevents lodging and was the trait responsible for the Green Revolution. Today, more sophisticated traits are needed for generating crops that are both resilient and sustainable. Revealing the molecular mechanisms that control the temporal transition between proliferation and differentiation will help unlock the potential of next-generation crops. Here, we report that CHIQUITA 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana is needed to maintain the proper timing of the transition between proliferation and differentiation in leaves and roots.",

Boundary domains display reduced growth and orchestrate development of adjacent tissues in a non-cell autonomous manner. How these two functions are achieved remains elusive despite the identification of several boundary-specific genes. Here, we show using morphometrics at the organ and cellular levels that leaf boundary domain development requires SPINDLY (SPY), an O-fucosyltransferase, to act as cell growth repressor. Further we show that SPY acts redundantly with the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON transcription factors (CUC2 and CUC3), which are major determinants of boundaries development. Accordingly at the molecular level, CUC2 and SPY repress a common set of genes involved in cell wall loosening providing a molecular framework for the growth repression associated with boundary domains. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed that young leaf boundary domain cells have stiffer cell walls than marginal outgrowth. This differential cell wall stiffness was reduced in spy mutant. Taken together our data reveal a concealed CUC2 cell wall associated gene network linking tissue patterning with cell growth and mechanics.\n\nSummary statementDecreased cell-wall loosening gene expression contributes to the coordination of cell growth and mechanics with tissue patterning thus driving boundary development.",

However, it remains unclear if similar effects exist if encoded associations are emotional. Do emotional schemas also facilitate learning and subsequent retrieval? Does it depend on the type of experienced emotions?\n\nUsing a novel face-word pair association paradigm combined with fMRI and eye-tracking techniques, we demonstrated and replicated in two independent studies that congruency with emotion schemas and emotion category interact to affect associative memory. Overall, emotion schemas facilitated memory for associative context, paralleled by the recruitment of left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during successful encoding of emotionally congruent vs. incongruent pairs. However, emotion schema effects differed across two negative emotion categories: disgust and fear, with disgust remembered better than fear. The IFG engagement was higher during successful encoding of congruent vs. incongruent pairs, but only in the case of disgust, suggestive of more semantic processing involved in learning disgust-related associations. On the contrary, the encoding of congruent vs. incongruent fear-related pairs was supported by activity in right fusiform gyrus (FG), suggesting greater sensory processing of faces. Successful memory formation for congruent disgust-related pairs was associated with a higher loading of pupil dilation component related to sympathetic activation, longer gaze time on words compared to faces, and more gaze switches between the two. This was reversed for fear-related pairs where the faces attracted more attention, as reflected by longer gaze time (compared to words).\n\nOverall, our results at the behavioural, physiological, and neural level converge to suggest that emotional congruency influences memory similar to semantic schemas. However, encoding processes and neural effects vary depending on emotion category, reflecting the differential role of semantic processing and visual attention processes in the modulation of memory by disgust and fear.",

SNAIL works by leveraging machine learning and other computational approaches to identify DNA sequence features that confer cell type-specific gene activation and using them to make a probe that drives an affinity purification-compatible reporter gene. As a proof of concept, we designed and validated two novel SNAIL probes that target parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons. Furthermore, we show that nuclear isolation using SNAIL in wild type mice is sufficient to capture characteristic open chromatin features of PV neurons in the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus.

Canonical drugs target mainly the proliferative capacity of cancer cells, which often leaves slow-proliferating, persistent cancer cells unaffected. Metabolic determinants that contribute to growth-independent functions supporting resistance and metastatic dissemination are still poorly understood.\n\nIn the present study, we revealed that antifolate treatment results in an uncoupled and autarkic mitochondrial one-carbon (1C) metabolism allowing sustained serine catabolism and formate overflow when cytosolic 1C metabolism is impaired. Interestingly, antifolate dependent growth-arrest did not correlate with decreased migration capacity. Therefore, using the antifolate Methotrexate as a tool compound allowed us to disentangle proliferation and migration to profile the metabolic phenotype of migrating (growth-arrested) cells. Supported by an increased NAD/NADH ratio, we observed increased serine de novo synthesis and increased serine catabolism to formate.\n\nConsequently, inhibition of serine de novo synthesis using the competitive PHGDH-inhibitor BI-4916 or direct inhibition of mitochondrial 1C metabolism reduced cancer cell migration. Using an orthotopic breast cancer model, we show that sole inhibition of mitochondrial serine catabolism does not affect primary tumor growth but strongly inhibits pulmonary metastasis.\n\nWe conclude that mitochondrial 1C metabolism, despite being dispensable for proliferative capacities, confers an advantage to cancer cells by supporting their motility potential.\n\nOur results improve our understanding of 1C metabolism and of metabolic determinants that support the process of cancer cell migration and metastasis.",

Our genome-wide screen for genes that affect actin cable stability identified the open reading frame YKL075C. Deletion of YKL075C results in increases in actin cable stability and abundance, mitochondrial fitness, and replicative lifespan. Transcriptome analysis revealed a role for YKL075C in regulating branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. Consistent with this, modulation of BCAA metabolism or decreasing leucine levels promotes actin cable stability and function in mitochondrial quality control. Our studies support a role for actin stability in yeast lifespan, and demonstrate that this process is controlled by BCAA and a previously uncharacterized ORF YKL075C, which we refer to as actin, aging and nutrient modulator protein 1 (AAN1).",

Using molecular dynamics of patchy colloids, we model a system of two species of proteins, giving origin to specific heterotypic bonds. We find that concentrations, together with valence and bond strength, control both the size and the growth time rate of the clusters. In particular, if one species is in large excess, it gradually saturates the binding sites of the other species: the system becomes then kinetically arrested and cluster coarsening slows down or stops, thus yielding effective size selection. This phenomenology is observed both in solid and fluid clusters, which feature additional generic homotypic interactions and are reminiscent of the ones observed on biological membranes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundBioinformatics software tools operate largely through the use of specialized genomics file formats. Often these formats lack formal specification, and only rarely do the creators of these tools robustly test them for correct handling of input and output. This causes problems in interoperability between different tools that, at best, wastes time and frustrates users. At worst, interoperability issues could lead to undetected errors in scientific results.\n\nMethodsWe sought (1) to assess the interoperability of a wide range of bioinformatics software using a shared genomics file format and (2) to provide a simple, reproducible method for enhancing inter-operability. As a focus, we selected the popular Browser Extensible Data (BED) file format for genomic interval data. Based on the file formats original documentation, we created a formal specification. We developed a new verification system, Acidbio (https://github.com/hoffmangroup/acidbio), which tests for correct behavior in bioinformatics software packages. We crafted tests to unify correct behavior when tools encounter various edge cases--potentially unexpected inputs that exemplify the limits of the format. To analyze the performance of existing software, we tested the input validation of 80 Bioconda packages that parsed the BED format. We also used a fuzzing approach to automatically perform additional testing.\n\nResultsOf 80 software packages examined, 75 achieved less than 70% correctness on our test suite. We categorized multiple root causes for the poor performance of different types of software. Fuzzing detected other errors that the manually designed test suite could not. We also created a badge system that developers can use to indicate more precisely which BED variants their software accepts and to advertise the softwares performance on the test suite.\n\nDiscussionAcidbio makes it easy to assess interoperability of software using the BED format, and therefore to identify areas for improvement in individual software packages. Applying our approach to other file formats would increase the reliability of bioinformatics software and data.",

To understand the consequences of whole chromosome-level aneuploidies on the proteome, we integrated aneuploidy, transcriptomic and proteomic data from hundreds of TCGA/CPTAC tumor samples. We found a surprisingly large number of expression changes happened on other, non-aneuploid chromosomes. Moreover, we identified an association between those changes and co-complex members of proteins from aneuploid chromosomes. This co-abundance association is tightly regulated for aggregation-prone aneuploid proteins and those involved in a smaller number of complexes. On the other hand, we observe that complexes of the cellular core machinery are under functional selection to maintain their stoichiometric balance in aneuploid tumors. Ultimately, we provide evidence that those compensatory and functional maintenance mechanisms are established through post-transcriptional control and that the degree of success of a tumor to deal with aneuploidy-induced stoichiometric imbalance impacts the activation of cellular protein degradation programs and patient survival.",

    "preprint_abstract": "DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination is confined to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle partly due to 53BP1 antagonizing DNA end resection in G1 phase and non-cycling quiescent (G0) cells where DSBs are predominately repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Unexpectedly, we uncovered extensive MRE11- and CtIP-dependent DNA end resection at DSBs in G0 mammalian cells. A whole genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen revealed the DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) complex as a key factor in promoting DNA end resection in G0 cells. In agreement, depletion of FBXL12, which promotes ubiquitylation and removal of the KU70/KU80 subunits of DNA-PK from DSBs, promotes even more extensive resection in G0 cells. In contrast, a requirement for DNA-PK in promoting DNA end resection in proliferating cells at the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle was not observed. Our findings establish that DNA-PK uniquely promotes DNA end resection in G0, but not in G1 or G2 phase cells, and has important implications for DNA DSB repair in quiescent cells.",

Here we statistically demonstrate using geometric morphometric analysis that both the shape of the palate and many non-shape variables particularly associated with vomerine teeth are ecologically informative in early stem- and basal crown-group salamanders. The morphology of the palate is heavily impacted by convergence constrained by feeding mechanisms and also exhibits clear stepwise evolutionary patterns with alternative phenotypic designs to cope with similar functional demand. Paleoecological disparities in early salamanders had took place before the Middle Jurassic and have achieved all ecological preferences in the Early Cretaceous. Metamorphosis is significant in the expansion of ecomorphospace of the palate in early salamanders. The common ancestor of salamanders is metamorphosed and terrestrial, and share unified lifestyles with other modern amphibians.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacterial chromosome structure is organized by a diverse group of proteins collectively referred to as nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). Many NAPs have been well studied in Streptomyces, including Lsr2, HupA, HupS, and sIHF. Here, we show that SCO1839 represents a novel family of Actinobacteria NAPs and recognizes a consensus sequence consisting of GATC followed by (A/T)T. The protein was designated Gbn for GATC-binding NAP. Deletion of gbn led to alterations in development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) detected more than 2800 binding regions, encompassing some 3600 GATCWT motifs, which comprise 55% of all such motifs in the S. coelicolor genome. DNA binding of Gbn in vitro increased DNA stiffness but not compaction, suggesting a role in regulation rather than chromosome organization. Transcriptomics analysis showed that Gbn binding generally leads to reduced gene expression. The DNA binding profiles were nearly identical between vegetative and aerial growth. Exceptions are SCO1311 and SCOt32, for a tRNA editing enzyme and a tRNA that recognises the rare leucine codon CUA, respectively, which nearly exclusively bound during vegetative growth. Taken together, our data show that Gbn is a highly pleiotropic NAP that impacts growth and development in streptomycetes.\n\nIMPORTANCEA large part of the chemical space of bioactive natural products is derived from Actinobacteria. Many of the biosynthetic gene clusters for these compounds are cryptic, in others words, they are expressed in nature but not in the laboratory. Understanding the global regulatory networks that control gene expression is key to the development of approaches to activate this biosynthetic potential. Chromosome structure has a major impact on the control of gene expression. In bacteria, the organization of chromosome structure is mediated by a diverse group of proteins referred to collectively as nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), which play an important role in the control of gene expression, nucleoid structure and DNA repair. We here present the discovery of a novel and extremely pleiotropic NAP, which we refer to as Gbn. Gbn is a sporulation-specific protein that occurs only in the Actinobacteria and binds to GATC sequences, with a subtle but broad effect on global gene expression. The discovery of Gbn is a new step towards better understanding of how gene expression and chromosome structure is governed in antibiotic-producing streptomycetes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) are protein-based organelles that house the enzymatic machinery for metabolism of niche carbon sources, allowing enteric pathogens to outcompete native microbiota during host colonization. While much progress has been made toward understanding MCP biogenesis, questions still remain regarding the mechanism by which core MCP enzymes are enveloped within the MCP protein shell. Here we explore the hypothesis that the shell protein PduB is responsible for linking the shell of the 1,2-propanediol utilization (Pdu) MCP from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 to its enzymatic core. Using fluorescent reporters, we demonstrate that all members of the Pdu enzymatic core are encapsulated in Pdu MCPs. We also demonstrate that PduB is the sole protein responsible for linking the entire Pdu enzyme core to the MCP shell. Using MCP purifications, transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy we find that shell assembly can be decoupled from the enzymatic core, as apparently empty MCPs are formed in Salmonella strains lacking PduB. Mutagenesis studies also reveal that PduB is incorporated into the Pdu MCP shell via a conserved, lysine-mediated hydrogen bonding mechanism. Finally, growth assays and systems-level pathway modeling reveal that unencapsulated pathway performance is strongly impacted by enzyme concentration, highlighting the importance of minimizing polar effects when conducting these functional assays. Together, these results provide insight into the mechanism of enzyme encapsulation within Pdu MCPs and demonstrate that the process of enzyme encapsulation and shell assembly are separate processes in this system, a finding that will aid future efforts to understand MCP biogenesis.\n\nImportanceMCPs are unique, genetically encoded organelles used by many bacteria to survive in resource-limited environments. There is significant interest in understanding the biogenesis and function of these organelles, both as potential antibiotic targets in enteric pathogens and also as useful tools for overcoming metabolic engineering bottlenecks. However, the mechanism by which these organelles are formed natively is still not completely understood. Here we provide evidence of a potential mechanism inS. enterica by which a single protein, PduB, links the MCP shell and metabolic core. This finding is critical for those seeking to disrupt MCPs during pathogenic infections or for those seeking to harness MCPs as nanobioreactors in industrial settings.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The WalR-WalK two-component regulatory system (TCS) is found in all Firmicutes, where it regulates the expression of multiple genes required for remodeling the cell envelope during growth and division. Unlike most TCSs, WalRK is essential for viability, so it has attracted interest as a potential antibiotic target. Here we used overexpression of WalR and CRISPR interference to investigate the Wal system of Clostridioides difficile, a major cause of hospital-associated diarrhea in high-income countries. We confirmed the wal operon is essential and identified morphological defects and cell lysis as the major terminal phenotypes of altered wal expression. We also used RNA-seq to identify over 150 genes whose expression changes in response to WalR levels. This gene set is enriched in cell envelope genes and includes several predicted PG hydrolases and proteins that could regulate PG hydrolase activity. A distinct feature of the C. difficile cell envelope is the presence of an S-layer and we found WalR affects expression of several genes which encode S-layer proteins. An unexpected finding was that some Wal-associated phenotypic defects were inverted in comparison to what has been reported in other Firmicutes. For example, down-regulation of Wal signaling caused C. difficile cells to become longer rather than shorter, as in Bacillus subtilis. Likewise, down-regulation of Wal rendered C. difficile more sensitive to vancomycin, whereas reduced Wal activity is linked to increased vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nImportanceThe WalRK two-component system (TCS) is essential for coordinating synthesis and turnover of peptidoglycan in Firmicutes. Here we investigate the WalRK TCS in Clostridioides difficile, an important bacterial pathogen with an atypical cell envelope. We confirmed that WalRK is essential and regulates cell envelope biogenesis, although several of the phenotypic changes we observed were opposite to what has been reported in other Firmicutes. We also identified over 150 genes whose expression is controlled either directly or indirectly by WalR. Overall, our findings provide a foundation for future investigations of an important regulatory system and potential antibiotic target in C. difficile.",

As azoles provide the preferred first-line option for treatment of Aspergillosis, the increase in rates of resistance and the poor therapeutic outcomes for those infected with a resistant isolate constitutes a serious global health threat. Azole resistance is frequently associated with specific tandem repeat duplications of a promoter element upstream of cyp51A, the gene which encodes the target for this drug class in A. fumigatus. This promoter element is recognized by the activating transcription factors SrbA and AtrR. This region also provides a docking platform for the CCAAT-binding-complex (CBC) and HapX that cooperate in the regulation of genes involved in iron-consuming pathways including cyp51A. Here, we studied the regulatory contribution of SrbA, AtrR, CBC and HapX binding sites on cyp51A expression and azole resistance during different iron availability employing promoter mutational analysis and protein/DNA interaction analysis. This strategy revealed iron status-dependent and -independent roles of these regulatory elements. We show that promoter occupation by both AtrR and SrbA is required for iron-independent steady-state transcriptional activation of cyp51A and its induction during short-term iron exposure relies on HapX binding. We further uncover the HapX binding site as repressor element the disruption of which elevates cyp51A expression and azole resistance regardless of iron availability.",

However, the mechanisms of its infection and replication in host cells are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the structure and function of DWV 3C protease (3Cpro), which is necessary for the cleavage of the polyprotein to synthesize mature viral proteins. We found that the 3Cpros of DWV and picornaviruses share common enzymatic properties, including sensitivity to the same inhibitors, such as rupintrivir. The predicted structure of DWV 3Cpro by AlphaFold2, the predicted rupintrivir binding domain, and the protease activities of mutant proteins revealed that it has a Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad. Moreover, 3Cpros of other Iflaviruses and Dicistrovirus appear to contain Asn, Ser, Asp, or Glu as the third residue of the catalytic triad, suggesting diversity in insect RNA viruses. Both precursor 3Cpro with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and mature 3Cpro are present in DWV-infected cells, suggesting that they may have different enzymatic properties and functions. DWV 3Cpro is the first 3Cpro characterized among insect RNA viruses, and our study uncovered both the common and unique characteristics among 3Cpros of Picornavirales.

Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by 3-4 different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced co-assembly with nucleic acids. This suggests that the sequence variability of N-protein is mirrored by high plasticity of N-protein biophysical properties, which we hypothesize can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to achieve greater efficiency of viral assembly, and thereby enhanced infectivity.",

This is especially puzzling since recent studies demonstrate that a surprising amount of functionally relevant diversity is present at all levels of resolution, down to strains differing by 100 nucleotides or fewer. Rigorously defining coarse-grainability and understanding the conditions for its emergence is of critical importance for understanding microbial ecosystems. To begin addressing these questions, we propose a minimal model for investigating hierarchically structured ecosystems within the framework of resource competition. We use our model to operationally define coarse-graining quality based on reproducibility of the outcomes of a specified experiment and show that a coarse-graining can be operationally valid despite grouping together functionally diverse strains. We further show that, at least within our model, a high diversity of strains (while nominally more complex) may in fact facilitate coarse-grainability. However, this only applies if the pool of interacting strains is sampled from the appropriate \"native\" environment, as we discuss.",

While we know nearly all mammalian kinetochore proteins, how these give rise to the strong yet dynamic microtubule attachments required for function remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the Astrin-SKAP complex, which localizes to bioriented kinetochores and is essential for chromosome segregation, but whose mechanical role is unclear. Live imaging reveals that SKAP depletion dampens movement and decreases coordination of metaphase sister kinetochores, and increases tension between them. Using laser ablation to isolate kinetochores bound to polymerizing vs depolymerizing microtubules, we show that without SKAP kinetochores move slower on both polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubules, and that more force is needed to rescue microtubules to polymerize. Thus, in contrast to previously described kinetochore proteins that increase grip on microtubules under force, Astrin-SKAP reduces grip, increasing attachment dynamics and force responsiveness and reducing friction. Together, our findings suggest a model where the Astrin-SKAP complex effectively \"lubricates\" correct, bioriented attachments to help preserve them.",

The capacity to remove toxic proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative disorders attests to the disease-modifying potential of the autophagy pathway. However, neurons respond only marginally to conventional methods for inducing autophagy, limiting efforts to develop therapeutic autophagy modulators for neurodegenerative diseases. The determinants underlying poor autophagy induction in neurons and the degree to which neurons and other cell types are differentially sensitive to autophagy stimuli are incompletely defined. Accordingly, we sampled nascent transcript synthesis and stabilities in fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons), thereby uncovering a neuron-specific stability of transcripts encoding myotubularin-related phosphatase 5 (MTMR5). MTMR5 is an autophagy suppressor that acts with its binding partner, MTMR2, to dephosphorylate phosphoinositides critical for autophagy initiation and autophagosome maturation. We found that MTMR5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress autophagy in iNeurons and undifferentiated iPSCs. Using optical pulse labeling to visualize the turnover of endogenously-encoded proteins in live cells, we observed that knockdown of MTMR5 or MTMR2, but not MTMR9, significantly enhances neuronal degradation of TDP-43, an autophagy substrate implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, our findings establish a regulatory mechanism of autophagy intrinsic to neurons and targetable for clearing disease-related proteins in a cell type-specific manner. In so doing, our results not only unravel novel aspects of neuronal biology and proteostasis, but also elucidate a strategy for modulating neuronal autophagy that could be of high therapeutic potential for multiple neurodegenerative diseases.",

Here, we present fluorescent BSA-gold (fBSA-Au), a bimodal endocytic tracer as fiducial marker for 2D and 3D CLEM applications. fBSA-Au consists of colloidal gold (Au) particles stabilized with fluorescent bovine serum albumin (BSA). The conjugate is efficiently endocytosed and distributed throughout the 3D endo-lysosomal network of the cells, and has an excellent visibility both in fluorescence microscopy (FM) and EM. We demonstrate the use of fBSA-Au in several 2D and 3D CLEM applications using Tokuyasu cryosections, resin-embedded material, and cryo-EM. As a fiducial marker, fBSA-Au facilitates rapid registration of regions of interest between FM and EM modalities and enables accurate (50-150 nm) correlation of fluorescence to EM data. Endocytosed fBSA-Au benefits from a homogenous 3D distribution throughout the endosomal system within the cell, and does not obscure any cellular ultrastructure. The broad applicability and visibility in both modalities makes fBSA-Au an excellent endocytic fiducial marker for 2D and 3D (cryo-)CLEM applications.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Large amounts of data from microbiome-related studies have been (and are currently being) deposited on international public databases. These datasets represent a valuable resource for the microbiome research community and could serve future researchers interested in integrating multiple datasets into powerful meta-analyses. However, this huge amount of data lacks harmonization and is far from being completely exploited in its full potential to build a foundation that places microbiome research at the nexus of many subdisciplines within and beyond biology. Thus, urges the need for data accessibility and reusability, according to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, as supported by National Microbiome Data Collaborative and FAIR Microbiome.\n\nTo tackle the challenge of accelerating discovery and advances in skin microbiome research, we collected, integrated and organized existing microbiome data resources from human skin 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing experiments. We generated a comprehensive collection of datasets, enriched in metadata, and organized this information into data frames ready to be integrated into microbiome research projects and advanced post-processing analysis, such as data science applications (e.g. machine learning). Furthermore, we have created a data retrieval and curation framework built on three different stages to maximize the retrieval of datasets and metadata associated with them. Lastly, we highlighted some caveats regarding metadata retrieval and suggested ways to improve future metadata submissions.\n\nOverall, our work resulted in a curated skin microbiome datasets collection accompanied by a state-of-the-art analysis of the last 10 years of the skin microbiome field.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Xylem sap is the major transport route for nutrients from roots to shoots. Here, we investigated how variations in nitrogen (N) nutrition affected the metabolome and proteome of xylem sap, growth of the xylem endophyte Brennaria salicis and report transcriptional re-wiring of leaf defenses in poplar (Populus x canescens). We supplied poplars with high, intermediate or low concentrations of ammonium or nitrate. We identified 288 unique proteins in xylem sap. About 85% of the xylem sap proteins were shared among ammonium- and nitrate-supplied plants. The number of proteins increased with increasing N supply but the major functional categories (catabolic processes, cell wall-related enzymes, defense) were unaffected. Ammonium nutrition caused higher abundances of amino acids and carbohydrates, while nitrate caused higher malate levels in xylem sap. Pipecolic acid and N-hydroxy-pipecolic acid increased whereas salicylic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine decreased with increasing N nutrition. Untargeted metabolome analyses revealed 2179 features in xylem sap, of which 863 were differentially affected by N treatments. We identified 122 metabolites, mainly from specialized metabolism of the groups of salicinoids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics, flavonoids, and benzoates. Their abundances increased with decreasing N. Endophyte growth was stimulated in xylem sap of high N- and suppressed in that of low N-fed plants. The drastic changes in xylem sap composition caused massive changes in the transcriptional landscape of leaves and recruited defense pathways against leaf feeding insects and biotrophic fungi, mainly under low nitrate. Our study uncovers unexpected complexity and variability of xylem composition with consequences for plant defenses.\n\nSignificance statementThis study reports the largest, currently available plant xylem sap proteome and metabolome databases and highlights novel discoveries of specialized metabolites and phytohormones in the xylem sap. This is the first multi-omics study linking differences in nitrogen supply with changes xylem sap composition, endophyte growth and transcriptional defenses in leaves.",

In addition to well known risk factors such as lifestyle and genetic risk score, accumulation of environmental toxicants in organs relevant to glucose metabolism is increasingly recognized as additional risk factors for T2DM. Here, we describe the development of an in vivo oral cadmium (Cd) exposure model. It was shown that oral Cd exposure in drinking water followed by washout and high fat diet (HFD) in C57BL/6N mice results in islet Cd bioaccumulation comparable to that found in native human islets while mitigating the anorexic effects of Cd to achieve the same weight gain required to induce insulin resistance as in Cd naive control mice. Inter individual variation in plasma glucose and insulin levels as well as islet Cd bioaccumulation was observed in both female and male mice. Regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between islet Cd level and plasma insulin following a glucose challenge in males but not in females. This finding highlights the need to account for inter individual target tissue Cd concentrations when interpreting results from in vivo Cd exposure models. No effect of Cd on insulin secretion was observed in islets ex vivo, highlighting differences between in vivo and ex vivo cadmium exposure models. In summary, our oral in vivo Cd exposure-washout with HFD model resulted in islet Cd bioaccumulation that is relevant in the context of environmental cadmium exposure in humans. Here, we showed that islet Cd bioaccumulation is associated with complex cadmium-mediated changes in glucose clearance and {beta}-cell function. The model described here will serve as a useful tool to further examine the relationship between Cd exposure, islet Cd bioaccumulation, dysglycemia and their underlying mechanisms.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The way urbanization shapes the intraspecific variation of pollinator functional traits is little understood. However, this topic is relevant for investigating ecosystem services and pollinator health. Here, we studied how urbanization affects the functional traits of workers in two bumblebee species (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) sampled in 37 sites along a gradient of urbanization in North Italy (an area of 1800 km2 including the metropolitan context of Milan and other surrounding capital districts). Namely, we investigated the role played by land-use composition, configuration, temperature, flower resource abundance, and air pollutants on the variation of traits related to flight performance (i.e., body size, wing shape and size fluctuating asymmetry). These traits are relevant because they are commonly used as indicators of stress during insect development. The functional traits of the two bumblebees responded idiosyncratically to urbanization. Urban temperatures were associated with smaller wing sizes in B. pascuorum and with more accentuated fluctuating asymmetry of wing size in B. terrestris. Moreover, flower abundance correlated with bigger wings in B. terrestris and with less asymmetric wing sizes in B. pascuorum. Other traits did not vary significantly and other urban variables played minor effects. These patterns highlight that environmental stressors linked to urbanization negatively impact traits related to flight performance and development stability of these species with possible consequences on the pollination service they provide.\n\nOverall, this study found species-specific variation patterns in syntopic taxa, expanding our understanding about the effects of anthropic disturbance in shaping relevant functional traits of pollinator model species.",

Much progress has been made to reveal task-induced modulations in the whole-brain functional connectome, but we still lack a way to model changes in the brains functional organization. Here, we present a novel connectome-to-connectome (C2C) state transformation framework that enables us to model the brains functional reorganization in response to specific task goals. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project, we demonstrate that the C2C model accurately generates an individuals task-specific connectomes from their task-free connectome with a high degree of specificity across seven different cognitive states. Moreover, the C2C model amplifies behaviorally relevant individual differences in the task-free connectome, thereby improving behavioral predictions. Finally, the C2C model reveals how the connectome reorganizes between cognitive states. Previous studies have reported that task-induced modulation of the brain connectome is domain-specific as well as domain-general, but did not specify how brain systems reconfigure to specific cognitive states. Our observations support the existence of reliable state-specific systems in the brain and indicate that we can quantitatively describe patterns of brain reorganization, common across individuals, in a computational model.",

Herein, we characterize use of second and third harmonic generation microscopy for label-free imaging of murine and human peripheral nerve via a novel multicolor multiphoton microscope based on a single excitation wavelength at 1300 nm. Second harmonic generation signal from collagen centered about 650 nm delineates neural connective tissue, while third harmonic general signal centered about 433 nm delineates myelin and other lipids. In transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein linked to the thy1 promoter, three-photon-excitation with emission peak at 527 nm delineates axoplasm. We compare label-free multiphoton imaging of murine and human peripheral nerve against conventional chemical stains and discuss clinical implications of this approach in guiding intraoperative decision making in nerve transfer procedures.",

Often associated with restriction modification (RM) systems, they also provide a defence against foreign DNA. Little is known regarding the methylome of the mycoplasma genus, which encompasses several pathogenic species with small genomes. Here, single molecule real-time (SMRT) and bisulphite sequencing combined with whole-genome analysis identified 19 methylated motifs associated with three orphan methyltransferases (MTases) and eight RM systems in Mycoplasma agalactiae, a ruminant pathogen and a model organism. All systems had a homolog in at least one phylogenetically distinct Mycoplasma spp. Our study also revealed that several superimposed genetic events may participate in the M. agalactiae dynamic epigenome landscape. These included (i) DNA shuffling and frameshift mutations that affect the MTase and restriction endonuclease content of a clonal population and (ii) gene duplication, erosion, and horizontal transfer that modulate MTase and RM repertoires of the species. Some of these systems were experimentally shown to play a major role in mycoplasma conjugative, horizontal DNA transfer. While the versatility of DNA methylation may contribute to regulating essential biological functions at cell and population levels, RM systems may be key in mycoplasma genome evolution and adaptation by controlling horizontal gene transfers.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a new technology that measures mRNA expression across thousands of spots on a tissue slice, while preserving information about the spatial location of spots. ST is typically applied to several replicates from adjacent slices of a tissue. However, existing methods to analyze ST data do not take full advantage of the similarity in both gene expression and spatial organization across these replicates. We introduce a new method PASTE (Probabilistic Alignment of ST Experiments) to align and integrate ST data across adjacent tissue slices leveraging both transcriptional similarity and spatial distances between spots. First, we formalize and solve the problem of pairwise alignment of ST data from adjacent tissue slices, or layers, using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (FGW-OT), which accounts for variability in the composition and spatial location of the spots on each layer. From these pairwise alignments, we construct a 3D representation of the tissue. Next, we introduce the problem of simultaneous alignment and integration of multiple ST layers into a single layer with a low rank gene expression matrix. We derive an algorithm to solve the problem by alternating between solving FGW-OT instances and solving a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of a weighted expression matrix. We show on both simulated and real ST datasets that PASTE accurately aligns spots across adjacent layers and accurately estimates a consensus expression matrix from multiple ST layers. PASTE outperforms integration methods that rely solely on either transcriptional similarity or spatial similarity, demonstrating the advantages of combining both types of information.\n\nCode availabilitySoftware is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/paste",

Despite its outstanding sensitivity, wider application of this technique has been hindered by complex instrumentation requirements and the challenging nature of the data analysis. The point spread function (PSF) of the 4Pi optical system is difficult to model, leading to periodic image artifacts and compromised resolution. In this work we report the development of a 4Pi-STORM microscope which obtains improved resolution and accuracy by modeling the 4Pi PSF dynamically, while using a simpler optical design. We introduce dynamic spline PSF models, which incorporate fluctuations in the modulation phase of the experimentally determined PSF, capturing the temporal dynamics of the optical system. Our method reaches the theoretical limits for localization precision while largely eliminating phase-wrapping artifacts, by making full use of the information content of the data. With a 3D precision as high as 2 - 3 nanometers, 4Pi-STORM achieves new levels of image detail, and extends the range of biological questions that can be addressed by fluorescence nanoscopy, as we demonstrate by investigating protein and nucleic acid organization in primary neurons and mammalian mitochondria.",

An essential beating regulator is the conserved central apparatus (CA) of motile cilia, composed of a pair of microtubules (C1 and C2) associated with hundreds of protein subunits per repeating unit. It is largely unclear how CA plays its regulatory roles in ciliary motility. Here, we present high-resolution structures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CA by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and its dynamic conformational behavior in multiple scales. The structures show how functionally related projection proteins of CA are clustered onto a spring-shaped scaffold of armadillo-repeat proteins, facilitated by elongated rachis-like proteins. The two halves of CA are brought together by elastic chain-like bridge proteins to achieve coordinated activities. We captured an array of kinesin-like protein (KLP1) in two different stepping states, which are actively correlated with beating wave propagation of cilia. These findings establish a structural framework for understanding the role of CA in cilia.",

    "preprint_abstract": "There is significant interest in using brain imaging data to predict non-brain-imaging phenotypes in individual participants. However, most prediction studies are underpowered, relying on less than a few hundred participants, leading to low reliability and inflated prediction performance. Yet, small sample sizes are unavoidable when studying clinical populations or addressing focused neuroscience questions. Here, we propose a simple framework - \"meta-matching\" - to translate predictive models from large-scale datasets to new unseen non-brain-imaging phenotypes in boutique studies. The key observation is that many large-scale datasets collect a wide range inter-correlated phenotypic measures. Therefore, a unique phenotype from a boutique study likely correlates with (but is not the same as) some phenotypes in some large-scale datasets. Meta-matching exploits these correlations to boost prediction in the boutique study. We applied meta-matching to the problem of predicting non-brain-imaging phenotypes using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Using the UK Biobank (N = 36,848), we demonstrated that meta-matching can boost the prediction of new phenotypes in small independent datasets by 100% to 400% in many scenarios. When considering relative prediction performance, meta-matching significantly improved phenotypic prediction even in samples with 10 participants. When considering absolute prediction performance, meta-matching significantly improved phenotypic prediction when there were least 50 participants. With a growing number of large-scale population-level datasets collecting an increasing number of phenotypic measures, our results represent a lower bound on the potential of meta-matching to elevate small-scale boutique studies.",

Infants, the elderly, and persons with compromised immunity are the population with higher risk of mortality from this infection. At present there is no commercially available, safe and efficacious vaccine for the control and management of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). More so, S. typhimurium has been shown to develop resistance against most antibiotics used for treatment of the infection. Capsaicin, a bioactive compound from Capsicum chinense (C. chinenses) is undoubtedly one of the most widely used spice in the world. This heat producing compound is not only been used as food additive but have been demonstrated to possess unique properties that have pharmacological, physiological, and antimicrobial applications. In this work, the antimicrobial property of pure capsaicin or capsaicin extract against S. typhimurium is tested to determine the compounds effectiveness in S. typhimurium inhibition. Capsaicin extract showed potent inhibition of S. typhimurium growth at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml, whereas pure capsaicin comparatively showed poorer inhibition of the bacteria. Furthermore, both capsaicin extract and pure capsaicin potently blocked S. typhimurium invasion of an animal cell line in vitro. Taken together, this work revealed that capsaicin might work synergistically with dihydrocapsaicin or the other capsaicinoids to inhibit S. typhimurium growth, whereas individually, capsaicin or dihydrocapsaicin could potently block the bacteria entry and invasion of Vero cells.",

We used this method to identify lipids altered due to Vitamin B12 deficiency and found that the levels of lipids with {omega}-3 fatty acid chains decreased while those with {omega}-6 increased. This method enables identification of by far the largest number of lipid species with structural isomers in a single experiment and would significantly advance our understanding of the role of lipids in biological processes.",

Here we confirm its autophagy-inducing effect by assessing classical autophagy-related parameters. Interestingly, we also discovered several additional effects of SMER28, including growth retardation and reduced G1 to S phase progression. Most strikingly, SMER28 treatment led to a complete arrest of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and consequently growth factor-induced cell scattering and dorsal ruffle formation. This coincided with a dramatic reduction of phosphorylation patterns of PI3K downstream effectors. Consistently, SMER28 directly inhibited PI3K{delta} and to a lesser extent p110{gamma}. The biological relevance of our observations was underscored by interference of SMER28 with InlB-mediated host cell entry of Listeria monocytogenes, which requires signaling through the prominent receptor typrosine kinase c-Met. This effect was signaling-specific, since entry of unrelated, gram-negative Salmonella Typhimurium was not inhibited.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae requires type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) for pathogenesis. However, a major facet of plant immunity entails the recognition of a subset of P. syringaes T3SEs by intracellular host receptors in a process called Effector- Triggered Immunity (ETI). Prior work has shown that ETI-eliciting T3SEs are pervasive in the P. syringae species complex raising the question of how P. syringae mitigates its ETI load to become a successful pathogen. While pathogens can evade ETI by T3SE mutation, recombination, or loss, there is increasing evidence that effector-effector (a.k.a., metaeffector) interactions can suppress ETI. To study the ETI-suppression potential of P. syringae T3SE repertoires, we compared the ETI-elicitation profiles of two genetically divergent strains: P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) and P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 (PmaES4326), which are both virulent on Arabidopsis thaliana but harbour largely distinct effector repertoires. Of the 529 T3SE alleles screened on A. thaliana Col-0 from the P. syringae T3SE compendium (PsyTEC) [1], 69 alleles from 21 T3SE families elicited ETI in at least one of the two strain backgrounds, while 50 elicited ETI in both backgrounds, resulting in 19 differential ETI responses including two novel ETI-eliciting families: AvrPto1 and HopT1. Although most of these differences were quantitative, three ETI responses were completely absent in one of the pathogenic backgrounds. We performed ETI suppression screens to test if metaeffector interactions contributed to these ETI differences, and found that HopQ1a suppressed AvrPto1m-mediated ETI, while HopG1c and HopF1g suppressed HopT1b-mediated ETI. Overall, these results show that P. syringae strains leverage metaeffector interactions and ETI suppression to overcome the ETI load associated with their native T3SE repertoires.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis is a progressive disease mediated by high joint loads. Foot progression angle modifications that reduce the knee adduction moment (KAM), a surrogate of knee loading, have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating pain and improving function. Although changes to the foot progression angle are overall beneficial, KAM reductions are not consistent across patients. Moreover, customized interventions are time-consuming and require instrumentation not commonly available in the clinic. We present a model that uses minimal clinical data to predict the extent of first peak KAM reduction after toe-in gait retraining. For such a model to generalize, the training data must be large and variable. Given the lack of large public datasets that contain different gaits for the same patient, we generated this dataset synthetically. Insights learned from ground-truth datasets with both baseline and toe-in gait trials (N=12) enabled the creation of a large (N=138) synthetic dataset for training the predictive model. On a test set of data collected by a separate research group (N=15), the first peak KAM reduction was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.134% body weight * height (%BW*HT). This error is smaller than the test sets subject average standard deviation of the first peak during baseline walking (0.306 %BW*HT). This work demonstrates the feasibility of training predictive models with synthetic data and may provide clinicians with a streamlined pathway to identify a patient-specific gait retraining outcome without requiring gait lab instrumentation.\n\nAuthor SummaryGait retraining as a conservative intervention for knee osteoarthritis shows great promise in extending pain-free mobility and preserving joint health. Although customizing a treatment plan for each patient may help to ensure a therapeutic response, this procedure cannot yet be performed outside of the gait laboratory, preventing research advances from becoming a part of clinical practice. Our work aims to predict the extent to which a patient with knee osteoarthritis will benefit from a non-invasive gait retraining therapy using measures that can be easily collected in the clinic. To overcome a lack of normative databases for gait retraining, we generated data synthetically based on limited ground-truth examples, and provided experimental evidence for the models ability to generalize to new subjects by evaluating on data collected by a separate research group. Our results can contribute to a future in which predicting the therapeutic benefit of a potential treatment can determine a custom treatment path for any patient.",

Although tolerant cells may emerge prior to treatment, the stress of prolonged antibiotic exposure can also promote tolerance. Here, we sought to determine how Yersinia pseudotuberculosis responds to doxycycline exposure, to then verify if these gene expression changes could promote doxycycline tolerance in culture and in our mouse model of infection. Only four genes were differentially regulated in response to a physiologically-relevant dose of doxycycline: osmB and ompF were upregulated, tusB and cnfy were downregulated; differential expression also occurred during doxycycline treatment in the mouse. ompF, tusB and cnfy were also differentially regulated in response to chloramphenicol, indicating these could be general responses to ribosomal inhibition. cnfy has previously been associated with persistence and was not a major focus here. We found deletion of the OmpF porin resulted in increased antibiotic accumulation, suggesting expression may promote diffusion of doxycycline out of the cell, while OsmB lipoprotein had a minor impact on antibiotic permeability. Overexpression of tusB significantly impaired bacterial survival in culture and in the mouse, suggesting that tRNA modification by tusB, and the resulting impacts on translational machinery, may play an important role in promoting tolerance. We believe this is the first observation of bactericidal activity of doxycycline, which was revealed by reversing tusB downregulation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transactivator protein Tax has pleiotropic functions in the host cell affecting cell-cycle regulation, DNA damage response pathways and apoptosis. These actions of Tax have been implicated in the persistence and pathogenesis of HTLV-1-infected cells. It is now known that tax expression occurs in transcriptional bursts of the proviral plus-strand, but the effects of the burst on host transcription are not fully understood. We carried out RNA sequencing of two naturally-infected T-cell clones transduced with a Tax-responsive Timer protein, which undergoes a time-dependent shift in fluorescence emission, to study transcriptional changes during successive phases of the HTLV-1 plus-strand burst. We found that the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the NF-{kappa}B pathway, cell-cycle regulation, DNA damage response and apoptosis inhibition were immediate effects accompanying the plus-strand burst, and are limited to the duration of the burst. The results distinguish between the immediate and delayed effects of HTLV-1 reactivation on host transcription, and between clone-specific effects and those observed in both clones. The major transcriptional changes in the infected host T-cells observed here, including NF-kB, are transient, suggesting that these pathways are not persistently activated at high levels in HTLV-1-infected cells. The two clones diverged strongly in their expression of genes regulating the cell cycle. Up-regulation of senescence markers was a delayed effect of the proviral plus-strand burst and the up-regulation of some pro-apoptotic genes outlasted the burst. We found that activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway enhanced and prolonged the proviral burst, but did not increase the rate of reactivation. Our results also suggest that sustained plus-strand expression is detrimental to the survival of infected cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a lifelong infection that results in disease in [~]10% of cases. The HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax is involved in both the persistence of infected host cells, and the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection. tax is transcribed from the plus-strand of the provirus, and tax expression is not constitutive, but limited to transcriptional bursts. How these bursts affect host cell transcription is not completely understood. Here, we studied the temporal changes in host transcription during successive phases of the plus-strand burst in two naturally-infected T-cell clones. We found that the deregulation of genes involved in Tax-associated processes, including NF-{kappa}B activation, cell-cycle regulation, DNA damage response and suppression of apoptosis, coincided with the early phase of the plus-strand burst: these transcriptional effects appear to be limited to the duration of the proviral plus-strand expression. Regulation of cell-cycle genes diverged between the clones, demonstrating the heterogeneity of naturally-infected cells. We observed a pro-apoptotic response, which outlasted the burst and may indicate increased risk of apoptosis following the burst. Finally, we observed that AhR activity regulated the intensity and duration of the burst, but not the dynamics of reactivation.",

In this investigation, we demonstrate that TRP120 has a novel repetitive short liner motif (SLiM) that activates the evolutionarily conserved Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis. In silico analysis revealed that TRP120 has sequence and functional similarity with Hh ligands and a candidate Hh ligand SLiM was identified. siRNA knockdown of Hh signaling and transcriptional components significantly reduced infection. Co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that rTRP120-TR interacted directly with Hh receptor Patched-2 (PTCH2). E. chaffeensis infection resulted in early activation of Hh transcription factor GLI-1 and upregulation of Hh target genes. Moreover, soluble recombinant TRP120 (rTRP120) activated Hh and induced gene expression consistent with the eukaryotic Hh ligand. The TRP120 Hh SLiM (NPEVLIKD) induced nuclear translocation of GLI-1 in THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes and induced a rapid and expansive activation of Hh pathway target genes. Furthermore, Hh activation was blocked by an -TRP120 Hh SLiM antibody.\n\nTRP120 Hh SLiM significantly increased levels of Hh target, anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and siRNA knockdown of BCL-2 dramatically inhibited infection.\n\nBlocking Hh signaling with the inhibitor Vismodegib, induced a pro-apoptotic cellular program defined by decreased mitochondria membrane potential, significant reductions in BCL-2, activation of caspase 3 and 9, and increased apoptotic cells. This study reveals a novel E. chaffeensis SLiM ligand mimetic that activates Hh signaling to maintain E. chaffeensis infection by engaging a BCL-2 anti-apoptotic cellular program.\n\nAuthor summary\n\nEhrlichia chaffeensis is an obligately intracellular bacterium that preferentially infects and replicates within mononuclear phagocytes and survives intracellularly by modulating cellular signaling pathways to subvert innate immune defenses. This investigation reveals the complex and expanding role that the E. chaffeensis TRP120 moonlighting effector and SLiM ligand mimetics have on immune subversion and infection through activation and regulation of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways. Herein, we define a TRP120 Hh SLiM mimetic that induces Hh signaling and regulates the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 to prevent sequential activation of caspase 9 and 3, promoting E. chaffeensis infection. This study defines a novel prokaryotic SLiM mimetic that repurposes evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic signaling pathways to promote survival of an intracellular bacterium.",

    "preprint_abstract": "To infer a causal relationship between two traits, several correlation-based causal direction (CD) methods have been proposed with the use of SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs) based on GWAS summary data for the two traits; however, none of the existing CD methods can deal with SNPs with correlated pleiotropy. Alternatively, reciprocal Mendelian randomization (MR) can be applied, which however may perform poorly in the presence of (unknown) invalid IVs, especially for bi-directional causal relationships. In this paper, first, we propose a CD method that performs better than existing methods regardless of the presence of correlated pleiotropy. Second, along with a simple but yet effective IV screening rule, we propose applying a closely related and state-of-the-art MR method in reciprocal MR, showing its almost identical performance to that of the new CD method when their model assumptions hold; however, if the modeling assumptions are violated, the new CD method is expected to better control type I errors. Notably bi-directional causal relationships impose some unique challenges beyond those for uni-directional ones, and thus requiring special treatments. For example, we point out for the first time several scenarios where a bi-directional relationship, but not a uni-directional one, can unexpectedly cause the violation of some weak modeling assumptions commonly required by many robust MR methods. Finally we applied the proposed methods to 12 risk factors and 4 common diseases, confirming mostly well-known uni-directional causal relationships, while identifying some novel and plausible bi-directional ones such as between BMI and T2D, and between BMI and CAD.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Inferring protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important task in computational biology. Recent methods based on Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) or Mutual Information (MI) allow to find interaction partners among paralogs of two protein families. Does successful inference mainly rely on correlations from structural contacts or from phylogeny, or both? Do these two types of signal combine constructively or hinder each other? To address these questions, we generate and analyze synthetic data produced using a minimal model that allows us to control the amounts of structural constraints and phylogeny. We show that correlations from these two sources combine constructively to increase the performance of partner inference by DCA or MI. Furthermore, signal from phylogeny can rescue partner inference when signal from contacts becomes less informative, including in the realistic case where inter-protein contacts are restricted to a small subset of sites. We also demonstrate that DCA-inferred couplings between non-contact pairs of sites improve partner inference in the presence of strong phylogeny, while deteriorating it otherwise. Moreover, restricting to non-contact pairs of sites preserves inference performance in the presence of strong phylogeny. In a natural data set, as well as in realistic synthetic data based on it, we find that non-contact pairs of sites contribute positively to partner inference performance, and that restricting to them preserves performance, evidencing an important role of phylogeny.\n\nAuthor summaryIn protein sequence data, the amino acid usages at different sites of a protein or of two interacting proteins can be correlated because of functional constraints. For instance, the need to maintain physicochemical complementarity among two sites that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of a protein complex causes such correlations. However, correlations can also arise due to shared evolutionary history, even in the absence of any functional constraint. While these phylogenetic correlations are known to obscure the inference of structural contacts, we show, using controlled synthetic data, that correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively to allow the inference of protein partners among paralogs using just sequences. We also show that pairs of amino acids that are not in contact in the structure have a major impact on partner inference in a natural data set and in realistic synthetic ones. These findings explain the success of methods based on pairwise maximum-entropy models or on information theory at predicting protein partners from sequences among paralogs.",

At early stages of neocortical development, angiogenic factors and chemokines such as CXCL12, ephrins, and semaphorins assume crucial roles in orchestrating neuronal migration and axon elongation of postmitotic neurons. Here we explore the intrinsic mechanical properties of the developing marginal zone of the pallium in the migratory pathways and brain distribution of the pioneer Cajal-Retzius cells. These pioneer neurons are generated in several proliferative regions in the developing brain (e.g., the cortical hem and the pallial subpallial boundary) and migrate tangentially in the preplate/marginal zone covering the upper portion of the neocortex. These cells play crucial roles in correct neocortical layer formation by secreting several molecules such as Reelin. Our results indicate that the motogenic properties of Cajal-Retzius cells and their perinatal distribution in the marginal zone are also modulated by both chemical and mechanical factors, by the specific mechanical properties of Cajal-Retzius cells, and by the differential stiffness of the migratory routes. Indeed, cells originating in the cortical hem display higher migratory capacities than those generated in the pallial subpallial boundary which may be involved in the differential distribution of these cells in the dorsal-lateral axis in the developing marginal zone.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Crossover formation is essential for proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Here we show that C. elegans Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK-2) forms a complex with cyclin-like protein COSA-1 and supports crossover formation by promoting conversion of meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) into crossover-specific recombination intermediates. Further, we identify MutS{gamma} component MSH-5 as a CDK-2 phosphorylation target. MSH-5 has a disordered C-terminal tail that contains 13 potential CDK phosphosites and is required to concentrate crossover-promoting proteins at recombination sites. Phosphorylation of the MSH-5 tail appears dispensable in a wild- type background, but when MutS{gamma} activity is partially compromised, crossover formation and retention of CDK-2/COSA-1 at recombination sites are exquisitely sensitive to phosphosite loss. Our data support a model in which robustness of crossover designation reflects a positive feedback mechanism involving CDK-2-mediated phosphorylation and scaffold-like properties of the MSH-5 C-terminal tail, features that combine to promote full recruitment and activity of crossover-promoting complexes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are effective in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity with proven cardiovascular benefits. However, most of them are peptides and require subcutaneous injection except for orally available semaglutide. Boc5 was identified as the first orthosteric non-peptidic agonist of GLP-1R that mimics a broad spectrum of bioactivities of GLP-1 in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Boc5 and its analog WB4-24 in complex with the human GLP-1R and Gs protein. Bound to the extracellular domain, extracellular loop 2, and transmembrane (TM) helices 1, 2, 3 and 7, one arm of both compounds inserted deeply into the bottom of the orthosteric binding pocket that is usually accessible by peptidic agonists, thereby partially overlapping with the residues A8-D15 in GLP-1. The other three arms, meanwhile, extended to the TM1-TM7, TM1-TM2, and TM2-TM3 clefts showing an interaction feature substantially similar to a previously known small molecule agonist LY3502970. Such a unique binding mode creates a distinct conformation that confers both peptidomimetic agonism and biased signaling induced by non-peptidic modulators at GLP-1R. Further, the conformational difference between Boc5 and WB4-24, two closed related compounds, provides a structural framework for fine tuning of pharmacological efficacy in the development of future small molecule therapeutics targeting GLP-1R.\n\nSignificanceGLP-1R agonists are efficacious in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. While most clinically used agents require subcutaneous injection, Boc5, as the first orthosteric non-peptidic agonist of GLP-1R, suffers from poor oral bioavailability that hinders its therapeutic development. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of Boc5 and its closely related analog WB4-24 presented here reveal a previously unknown binding pocket located deeper in the transmembrane domain for non-peptidic GLP-1R agonists. Molecular interaction with this site may facilitate a broad spectrum of in vivo agonistic activities, in addition to that with the upper helical bundles presumably responsible for biased signaling. These findings deepen our understanding of peptidomimetic agonism at GLP-1R and may help design better drug leads against this important target.",

We previously suggested a stochastic etiologic model where small-scale random perturbations could reach a threshold for MS development. The recently described mapping of the transient transcriptome (TT), including intergenic and intronic RNAs, seems appropriate to verify this model through a rigorous colocalization analysis. We show that genomic regions coding for the TT were significantly enriched for MS-associated GWAS variants and DNA binding sites for molecular transducers mediating putative, non-genetic, etiopathogenetic factors for MS (e.g., vitamin D deficiency, Epstein Barr virus latent infection, B cell dysfunction). These results suggest a model whereby TT-coding regions are hotspots of convergence between genetic ad non-genetic factors of risk/protection for MS, and plausibly for other complex disorders.

Owing to their foraging and honey production activities, honeybees form complex relationships with species across all domains, such as plants, viruses, bacteria (symbiotic and pathogenic), and other hive pests, making honey a valuable biomonitoring tool for assessing their ecological niche. Thus, the application of honey shotgun metagenomics (SM) has paved the way for a detailed description of the species honeybees interact with, in order to better assess the multiple factors governing their health. Here, we describe the implementation of optimized honey DNA extraction methodology coupled to direct shotgun metagenomics (Direct-SM) analysis, and to a computationally optimised and validated pipeline for taxonomic classification of species detected in honey. By comparing honey collected across 3 harvesting seasons in a stable apiary, we show that Direct-SM can describe the variability of sampled plant species, revealing honeybee behavioural adaptation. In addition, we reveal that Direct-SM can non-invasively capture the diversity of species comprising the core and non-core bacterial communities of the gut microbiome. Finally, we show that this methodology is applicable for the monitoring of pathogens and particularly for the biomonitoring varroa infestation. These results suggest that Direct-SM can accurately and comprehensively describe honeybee ecological niches and can be deployed to assess bee health in the field.",

    "preprint_abstract": "A century-long debate on bodily states and emotions persists. While the involvement of bodily activity in emotion physiology is widely recognized, the specificity and causal role of such activity related to brain dynamics has not yet been demonstrated. We hypothesize that the peripheral neural monitoring and control of cardiovascular activity prompts and sustains brain dynamics during an emotional experience, so these afferent inputs are processed by the brain by triggering a concurrent efferent information transfer to the body. To this end, we investigated the functional brain-heart interplay under emotion elicitation in publicly available data from 62 healthy participants using a computational model based on synthetic data generation of EEG and ECG signals. Our findings show that sympathovagal activity plays a leading and causal role in initiating the emotional response, in which ascending modulations from vagal activity precede neural dynamics and correlate to the reported level of arousal. The subsequent dynamic interplay observed between the central and autonomic nervous systems sustains emotional processing. These findings should be particularly revealing for the psychophysiology and neuroscience of emotions.\n\nSignificanceWe investigate the temporal dynamics of brain and cardiac activities in healthy subjects who underwent an emotional elicitation through videos. We demonstrate that, within the first few seconds, emotional stimuli modulate the heart activity, which in turn stimulate an emotion-specific cortical response in the brain. Then, the conscious emotional experience is sustained by a bidirectional brain-heart interplay and information exchange. Moreover, the perceived intensity of an emotional stimulus is predicted by the intensity of neural control regulating the heart activity. These findings may constitute the fundamental knowledge linking neurophysiology and psychiatric disorders, including the link between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular disorders.",

We here discover that DCT peptides opposedly mediate these two sets of transcription signals, all tunable in accordance to C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) of Ca2+/CaV1 influx. By electrophysiology, neurite morphology, and FRET 2-hybrid binding analyses, we systematically examined native and derived DCT peptides across CaV1, unveiling that the overall balance between cytosolic inhibition versus nuclear facilitation is spatially and temporally tuned by CMI of each DCT variant. Our findings not only resolve several controversies existing to DCT variants, but also propose a de novo scheme of CaV1-centric gene regulation: two concurrent routes of transcription signals initiated from either membrane CaV1 channels or nuclear CaV1-encoded peptides are subject to autonomous feedback tuning by peptide/channel interactions.",

Single-celled photosynthetic model systems have the potential to accelerate our ability to connect genes to functions. Here, using a barcoded mutant library of the model eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we determined the phenotypes of more than 58,000 mutants under more than 121 different environmental growth conditions and chemical treatments. 78% of genes are represented by at least one mutant that showed a phenotype, providing clues to the functions of thousands of genes. Mutant phenotypic profiles allow us to place known and previously uncharacterized genes into functional pathways such as DNA repair, photosynthesis, the CO2-concentrating mechanism, and ciliogenesis. We illustrate the value of this resource by validating novel phenotypes and gene functions, including the discovery of three novel components of a defense pathway that counteracts actin cytoskeleton inhibitors released by other organisms. The data also inform phenotype discovery in land plants: mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana genes exhibit similar phenotypes to those we observed in their Chlamydomonas homologs.

Recent progress has shown that genomic structural variants (SVs) have contributed to gene expression dynamics during tomato domestication, resulting in changes of important traits. Here, through comprehensive analyses of small RNAs (sRNAs) from nine representative tomato accessions, we demonstrate that SVs substantially contribute to the dynamic expression of the three major classes of plant sRNAs: microRNAs (miRNAs), phased secondary short interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), and 24-nt heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs). Changes in the abundance of phasiRNAs and 24-nt hc-siRNAs likely contribute to the alteration of mRNA gene expression during tomatos recent evolution, particularly for genes associated with biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. We also observe that miRNA expression dynamics are associated with imprecise processing, alternative miRNA-miRNA* selections, and SVs. SVs mainly affect the expression of less-conserved miRNAs that do not have established regulatory functions or low abundant members in highly expressed miRNA families, highlighting different selection pressures on miRNAs compared to phasiRNAs and 24-nt hc-siRNAs. Our findings provide insights into plant sRNA evolution as well as SV-based gene regulation during crop domestication.

Feedback disruptors exhibit low-nanomolar to picomolar IC-50s, reduce viral replication >100-fold in culture and in mice, and synergize with the standard-of-care antivirals. Strikingly, no feedback-disruptor escape mutants evolved over >60 days of culture, in contrast to approved antivirals to which resistance rapidly evolved.

    "preprint_abstract": "Soil microorganisms play a major role in shaping plant diversity, not only through their direct effects as pathogens, mutualists, and decomposers, but also by altering interactions between plants. In particular, previous research has shown that the soil community often generates frequency-dependent feedback loops among plants that can either destabilize species interactions, or generate stabilizing niche differences that promote species coexistence. However, recent insights from modern coexistence theory have shown that microbial effects on plant coexistence depend not only on these stabilizing or destabilizing effects, but also on the degree to which they generate competitive fitness differences. While many previous experiments have generated the data necessary for evaluating microbially mediated fitness differences, these effects have rarely been quantified in the literature. Here we present a meta-analysis of data from 50 studies, which we used to quantify the microbially mediated (de)stabilization and fitness differences derived from a classic plant-soil feedback model. Across 518 pairwise comparisons, we found that soil microbes generated both stabilization (or destabilization) and fitness differences, but also that the microbially mediated fitness differences dominated. As a consequence, if plants are otherwise equivalent competitors, the balance of soil microbe-generated (de)stabilization and fitness differences drives species exclusion much more frequently than coexistence or priority effects. Our work shows that microbially mediated fitness differences are an important but overlooked effect of soil microbes on plant coexistence. This finding paves the way for a more complete understanding of the processes that maintain plant biodiversity.",

Guided by simulations, microfluidics is then used to periodically perturb the system by modulating the concentration of one of the oscillator components with a given amplitude and frequency. When the ratio of the external  zeitgeber period and the intrinisic period is close to 1, we experimentally find period doubling and quadrupling in the oscillator dynamics, whereas for longer zeitgeber periods, we find stable entrainment. Our theoretical model suggests favorable conditions for which the oscillator can be utilized as an externally synchronized clock, but also demonstrates that related systems could, in principle, display chaotic dynamics.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) within species B, C, and E include the predominant types responsible for highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory infections. The traditional method to type these pathogens was based on virus neutralization and hemagglutination assays using antisera, which is both time-consuming and difficult, particularly due to the non-availability of reagents. Molecular typing based on partial characterization of HAdV hexon, as well as the restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of the genomics DNA, is difficult to identify recombinants. Here, a rapid, simple, and cost-effective molecular typing of respiratory HAdVs is presented. This incorporates three pairs of universal PCR primers that target the variable regions of the three major capsid genes, i.e. hexon, penton base and fiber genes. The protocol developed enables detection and typing of respiratory HAdVs within species B, C, and E, as well as of some strains within species D and F. Using this method, we surveyed a total of 100 children with acute respiratory infection caused by HAdVs in Hong Kong, Summer 2014 (July to October). 100 Throat swab specimens were collected. The samples were analyzed by PCR and the sequences were characterized by BLAST. HAdVs were detected in 98 out of 100 (98%) samples. The predominant HAdV type was species B type 3. Among the patients, 74 were of HAdV-B3 (74%), 10 were of HAdV-E4 (10%), 6 were of HAdV-C2 (21.7%), 2 were of HAdV-C6 (2%), 1 were of HAdV-B7 (2%), 1 were of HAdV-C1 (74%), and 2 were of recombinant types. The developed method allows the rapid identification of HAdVs with recombinant genomes, and bypasses the need for whole genome data, for the real-time surveillance of circulating adenovirus strains in immediate outbreaks and populations by clinical microbiologists, public health officers, and epidemiologists.",

However, sugars are attractive for most animal species, which makes it difficult to target only a specific pest insect species. Here, we assessed different sugar alcohols for their potential as more species-selective feeding stimulants for pest insects. We tested the attractiveness of the sugar alcohols sorbitol, xylitol and erythritol with a capillary feeder assay in wasps (as potential pest insects, because introduced wasps are a pest in many regions) and bees (as non-target insects). For the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris), sorbitol and xylitol acted as nutritive feeding stimulants, and erythritol acted as a non-nutritive feeding stimulant. For the buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris), sorbitol acted as a feeding stimulant, while for the honey bee (Apis mellifera), none of the sugar alcohols acted as feeding stimulant. The species-specific preferences for sugar alcohols suggest their potential as species-selective insect baits. The wasp-specific preference for xylitol suggests its potential as bee-safe alternative to sugar-containing bait for wasp pest control.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY We tested the attractiveness of sugar alcohols with a capillary feeder assay in wasps and bees.

    "preprint_abstract": "The construction of a high-quality multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from copies of a transposable element (TE) is a critical step in the characterization of a new TE family. Most studies of MSA accuracy have been conducted on protein or RNA sequence families where structural features and strong signals of selection may assist with alignment. Less attention has been given to the quality of sequence alignments involving neutrally evolving DNA sequences such as those resulting from TE replication. Such alignments play an important role in understanding and representing TE family history. Transposable element sequences are challenging to align due to their wide divergence ranges, fragmentation, and predominantly-neutral mutation patterns. To gain insight into the effects of these properties on MSA accuracy, we developed a simulator of TE sequence evolution, and used it to generate a benchmark with which we evaluated the MSA predictions produced by several popular aligners, along with Refiner, a method we developed in the context of our RepeatModeler software. We find that MAFFT and Refiner generally outperform other aligners for low to medium divergence simulated sequences, while Refiner is uniquely effective when tasked with aligning high-divergent and fragmented instances of a family. As a result, consensus sequences derived from Refiner-based MSAs are more similar to the true consensus.",

Genetic, transcriptional and translational intra-tumor heterogeneity contributes to this dynamic process. Beyond this, metabolic intra-tumor heterogeneity has also been observed, yet its role for cancer progression remains largely elusive. Here, we discovered that intra-tumor heterogeneity in phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) protein expression drives breast cancer cell dissemination and metastasis formation. Specifically, we observed intra-tumor heterogeneous PHGDH expression in primary breast tumors, with low PHGDH expression being indicative of metastasis in patients. In mice, Phgdh protein, but not mRNA, expression is low in circulating tumor cells and early metastatic lesions, leading to increased dissemination and metastasis formation. Mechanistically, low PHGDH protein expression induces an imbalance in glycolysis that can activate sialic acid synthesis. Consequently, cancer cells undergo a partial EMT and show increased p38 as well as SRC phosphorylation, which activate cellular programs of dissemination. In turn, inhibition of sialic acid synthesis through knock-out of cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (CMAS) counteracts the increased cancer cell dissemination and metastasis induced by low PHGDH expression. In conclusion, we find that heterogeneity in PHGDH protein expression promotes cancer cell dissemination and metastasis formation.",

Its release is essential in behaviour and is critically implicated in prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases. Existing dopamine detection methods are not able to detect and distinguish discrete dopamine release events from multiple varicosities. This prevents an understanding of how dopamine release is regulated across populations of discrete varicosities. Using a near infrared fluorescent (980 nm) dopamine nanosensor  paint (AndromeDA), we show that action potential-evoked dopamine release is highly heterogeneous across release sites and also requires molecular priming. Using AndromeDA, we visualize dopamine release at up to 100 dopaminergic varicosities simultaneously within a single imaging field with high temporal resolution (15 images/s). We find that  hotspots of dopamine release are highly heterogeneous and are detected at only ~17% of all varicosities. In neurons lacking Munc13 proteins, which prime synaptic vesicles, dopamine release is abolished during electrical stimulation, demonstrating that dopamine release requires vesicle priming. In summary, AndromeDA reveals the spatiotemporal organization of dopamine release.",

Regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between BMI GS groups and relative abundance of 973 metabolites.\n\nResultsAfter correction for multiple testing, 29 metabolites were associated with BMI GS group. Bilirubin was amongst the most strongly associated metabolites with reduced levels measured in individuals with the highest BMI GS (beta=-0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.46, -0.18, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted p=0.005). We observed associations between BMI GS group and levels of several potentially diet-related metabolites including hippurate which had lower mean abundance in individuals in the high BMI GS group (beta=-0.29, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.15, BH adjusted p=0.008).\n\nConclusionsTogether with existing literature our results suggest a genetic predisposition to higher BMI captures differences in metabolism leading to adiposity gain.

However, this notion has been challenged over the years by multiple experimental evidence. Here, we consider the physical condition of mechanical force balance as a determining condition of the nuclear volume and use quantitative, order-of-magnitude analysis to estimate the forces from different sources of nuclear and cellular pressure. Our estimates suggest that the dominant pressure within the nucleus and cytoplasm originates from the osmotic pressure of proteins and RNA molecules that are localized to the nucleus or cytoplasm by out-of-equilibrium, active nucleocytoplasmic transport rather than from chromatin or its associated ions. This motivates us to formulate a physical model for the ratio of the cell and nuclear volumes in which osmotic pressures of localized proteins determine the relative volumes. In accordance with unexplained observations that are century-old, our model predicts that the ratio of the cell and nuclear volumes is a constant, robust to a wide variety of biochemical and biophysical manipulations, and is changed only if gene expression or nucleocytoplasmic transport are modulated.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in preventing tumorigenesis. Here, we unravel how p53 modulates mitochondrial dynamics to restrain the metastatic properties of cancer cells. p53 inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling to attenuate the protein level of mitochondrial fission process 1 (MTFP1), which fosters the pro-fission dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation. This regulatory mechanism allows p53 to restrict cell migration and invasion governed by Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Downregulating p53 expression or elevating the molecular signature of mitochondrial fission correlates with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Upon p53 loss, exaggerated mitochondrial fragmentation stimulates the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling resulting in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes in cell morphology, accompanied by accelerated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression and invasive cell migration. Notably, blocking the activation of mTORC1/MTFP1/Drp1/ERK1/2 axis completely abolishes the p53 deficiency-driven cellular morphological switch, MMP9 expression, and cancer cell dissemination. Our findings unveil a hitherto unrecognized mitochondria-dependent molecular mechanism underlying the metastatic phenotypes of p53-compromised cancers.",

Computational approaches for modeling toxicological data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms have gained popularity over the last few years. Machine learning approaches have been used to predict toxicity-related biological activities using chemical structure descriptors. However, toxicity-related proteomic features have not been fully investigated. In this study, we construct a computational pipeline using machine learning models for predicting the most important protein features responsible for the toxicity of compounds taken from the Tox21 dataset that is implemented within the multiscale Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) therapeutic discovery platform. Tox21 is a highly imbalanced dataset consisting of twelve in vitro assays, seven from the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway and five from the stress response (SR) pathway, for more than 10,000 compounds. For the machine learning model, we employed a random forest with the combination of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method (SMOTE+ENN), which is a resampling method to balance the activity class distribution. Within the NR and SR pathways, the activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (NR-AhR), and mitochondrial membrane potential (SR-MMP) were two of the top-performing twelve toxicity endpoints with AUCROCs of 0.90 and 0.92, respectively. The top extracted features for evaluating compound toxicity were analyzed for enrichment to highlight the implicated biological pathways and proteins. We validated our enrichment results for the activity of the AhR using a thorough literature search. Our case study showed that the selected enriched pathways and proteins from our computational pipeline are not only correlated with AhR toxicity but also form a cascading upstream/downstream arrangement. Our work elucidate significant relationships between protein and compound interactions computed using CANDO and the associated biological pathways to which the proteins belong for twelve toxicity endpoints. This novel study uses machine learning not only to predict and understand toxicity but also elucidates therapeutic mechanisms at a proteomic level for a variety of toxicity endpoints.",

We examined the structure and activities of Pot1 in Ustilago maydis, a fungal model that recapitulates key features of mammalian telomere regulation.

UmPot1 binds directly to Rad51 and regulates the latters strand exchange activity. Deleting the OB-N domain, which is implicated in Rad51-binding, caused telomere shortening, suggesting that Pot1-Rad51 interaction facilitates telomere replication. Depleting Pot1 through transcriptional repression triggered growth arrest as well as rampant recombination, leading to multiple telomere aberrations. In addition, telomere repeat RNAs transcribed from both the G- and C-strand were dramatically up-regulated, and this was accompanied by elevated levels of telomere RNA-DNA hybrids. Telomere abnormalities of pot1-deficient cells were suppressed, and cell viability was restored by the deletion of genes encoding Rad51 or Brh2 (the BRCA2 ortholog), indicating that homology-directed repair (HDR) proteins are key mediators of telomere aberrations and cellular toxicity. Together, these observations underscore the complex physical and functional interactions between Pot1 and DNA repair factors, leading to context-dependent and dichotomous effects of HDR proteins on telomere maintenance and protection.",

Moreover, combining multiple pairs in different spectral channels enables us to image up to six different biological targets, effectively doubling the number of observable targets. The combination of synthetic probes with fluorescence lifetime multiplexing is thus a powerful approach for live-cell imaging.",

The nuclear-vacuole junction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is among the most extensive and better-known organelle contact sites, described to expand in response to various metabolic stresses. While using genotoxins with unrelated purposes, we serendipitously discovered a phenomenon that we describe as the most extreme and intimate contact ever reported between nuclei and vacuoles: the vacuole becomes completely internalized in the nucleus. We define lipids supporting negative curvature, such as phosphatidic acid and sterols, as bona-fide drivers of this event. Functionally, we purport that internalized vacuoles are low efficiency ones whose removal from the cytoplasm optimizes cargo interaction with functional vacuoles. Thus, our findings also point to nucleus-vacuole interactions as important for metabolic adaptation.

Among brain structures, Limbic structures are particular of interest in psychiatric disorder-related research. However, despite the promise of infant neuroimaging and the success of initial infant MRI studies, assessing limbic regions structure and function remains a significant challenge due to low inter-regional intensity contrast and high curvature (e.g., hippocampus). In addition, the agreement between existing automatic techniques and manual segmentation remains either untested or insufficient, particularly for the amygdala and hippocampus. In this work, we developed an accurate (based on three segmentation evaluation metrics), reliable and efficient infant deep learning segmentation framework (ID-Seg) to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we leveraged a large dataset of 473 infant MRI scans to train ID-Seg and rigorously evaluated ID-Segs performance on internal and external datasets with manual segmentations. Compared with a state-of-the-art segmentation pipeline, we demonstrated that ID-Seg significantly improved the segmentation accuracy of limbic structures (hippocampus and amygdala) in newborn infants. Moreover, in a medium-size dataset, we found that ID-Seg-derived morphometric measures yield strong brain-behavior associations. As such, our ID-Seg may improve our capacity and efficiency to measure MRI-based brain features relevant to neuropsychological development and ultimately advance the success of quantitative analyses on large-scale datasets.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy works through the interplay between immune and cancer cells. Particularly, interactions between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and cancer cells, such as PDCD1 (PD-1) and CD274 (PD-L1), are crucial for removing cancer cells. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting these interactions are effective only to a subset of patients, requiring the development of novel immunotherapy drugs with novel targets.\n\nGenome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening in either cancer or immune cells has been used to discover regulators of immune cell function as immunotherapeutic targets. However, the method has two main limitations. First, performing CRISPR screens in one cell type alone makes it difficult to identify essential intercellular interactions due to the focus on single genes instead of interactions. Second, pooled screening is associated with high noise levels. Therefore, we propose intercellular CRISPR screens, which perform genome-wide CRISPR screening in every interacting cell type to discover intercellular interactions as immunotherapeutic targets.\n\nIntercellular CRISPR screens use two individual genome-wide CRISPR screens one each in immune and cancer cells to evaluate intercellular interactions that are crucial for killing cancer cells. We used two publicly available genome-wide CRISPR screening datasets obtained while triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and CTLs were interacting. We analyzed 4825 interactions between 1391 ligands and receptors on TNBC cells and CTLs to assess the effects of intercellular interactions on CTL function by incorporating both CRISPR datasets and the expression levels of ligands and receptors.\n\nOur results showed that intercellular CRISPR screens discovered targets of approved drugs, a few of which were not identifiable using single datasets. To quantitatively evaluate the methods performance, we used data for cytokines and costimulatory molecules because they constitute the majority of immunotherapeutic targets. Combining both CRISPR datasets improved the F1 score of discovering these genes relative to using single CRISPR datasets by more than twice.\n\nOur results indicate that intercellular CRISPR screens can identify novel immune-oncology targets that were not obtained using individual CRISPR screens. The pipeline can be extended to other cancer and immune cell types, such as natural killer cells, to identify important intercellular interactions as potential immunotherapeutic targets.",

Bistable stimuli give us a rare opportunity to study the neural mechanisms behind this process. Such stimuli can be visually interpreted as simple or as more complex on the basis of the same sensory input. Previous studies demonstrated increased activity in the superior parietal cortex when participants perceived an illusory Gestalt impression compared to a simpler interpretation of individual elements. Here we tested whether activity related to the illusory Gestalt can be detected not only during, but also prior to it, by examining the slow fluctuations of resting-state-fMRI activity before the stimulus onset. We presented 31 participants with a bistable motion stimulus, which can be perceived either as four moving dot pairs (local) or two moving illusory squares (global). This allowed us to isolate the specific neural mechanisms that accompany the experience of an illusion under matched sensory input. fMRI was used to measure brain activity in a sparse event-related design. We observed stronger IPS and putamen responses to the stimulus when participants perceived the global interpretation compared to local, confirming the previously reported role of these areas in perceptual grouping. Most importantly, we also observed that the global stimulus interpretation was preceded by an increased activity of the bilateral dorsal insula, which is known to process saliency and gate information for conscious access. Our data suggest an important role of the dorsal insula in shaping an internally generated illusory Gestalt percept.",

It is considered that the division site in land plants is predetermined prior to mitosis and that the localization of the mitotic spindle does not govern the division plane. This contrasts with animal ACD, in which the division site is defined by active spindle-positioning mechanisms. Here, we isolated a hypomorphic mutant of the conserved microtubule-associated protein TPX2 in the moss Physcomitrium patens and observed abnormal spindle motility during cell division. This defect compromised the position of the division site and produced inverted daughter cell sizes in the first ACD of gametophore (leafy shoot) development. The phenotype was rescued by restoring endogenous TPX2 function and, unexpectedly, by depolymerizing actin filaments. Thus, we have identified an active spindle-positioning mechanism that, reminiscent of acentrosomal ACD in animals, involves microtubules and actin filaments and sets the division site in plants.",

This property is crucial for eukaryotic cells to achieve specific biological functions in different cellular compartments. Conventional approaches on biopolymers solution break down for cytoskeleton filaments because they entail several approximations to treat their polyelectrolyte and mechanical properties. In this article, we introduce a novel density functional theory for polydisperse, semiflexible cytoskeleton filaments. The approach accounts for the equilibrium polymerization kinetics, length and orientation filament distributions, as well as the electrostatic interaction between filaments and the electrolyte. This is essential for cytoskeleton polymerization in different cell compartments generating filaments of different lengths, sometimes long enough to become semiflexible. We characterized the thermodynamics properties of actin filaments in electrolyte aqueous solutions. We calculated the free energy, pressure, chemical potential and second virial coefficient for each filament conformation. We also calculated the phase diagram of actin filaments solution and compared with the corresponding results in in-vitro experiments.",

Here we show that ectopic expression of transcription regulators at high levels leads to nucleoid compaction. This serendipitous result was obtained by fluorescence microscopy upon ectopic expression of the transcription regulator and phosphodiesterase PdeL of Escherichia coli of a strain expressing the mCherry-tagged HU- subunit (HupA) for nucleoid staining. Nucleoid compaction by PdeL depends on DNA-binding, but not on its enzymatic phosphodiesterase activity. Nucleoid compaction was also observed upon high-level ectopic expression of the transcription regulators LacI, RutR, RcsB, LeuO and Cra, which range from single target gene regulators to global regulators. In case of LacI its high-level expression in presence of the gratuitous inducer IPTG also led to nucleoid compaction indicating that compaction is caused by unspecific DNA-binding. In all cases nucleoid compaction correlated with misplacement of the FtsZ ring and loss of MukB foci, a subunit of the SMC complex. Thus, high levels of several transcription regulators cause nucleoid compaction with consequences on transcription, replication, and cell division.\n\nImportanceThe bacterial nucleoid is a highly organized and dynamic structure for simultaneous, transcription, replication and segregation of the bacterial genome. Compaction of the nucleoid and disturbance of DNA segregation and cell division by artificially high levels of transcription regulators, as described here, reveals that an excess of DNA-binding protein disturbs nucleoid structuring. The results suggest that ectopic expression levels of DNA-binding proteins for genetic studies of their function but also for their purification should be carefully controlled and adjusted.",

Understanding how genomic sequence influences 3D organization can help elucidate their roles in various processes in healthy and disease states. However, the sequence determinants of genome structure across multiple spatial scales are still not well understood. To learn the complex sequence dependencies of multiscale genome architecture, here we developed a sequence-based deep learning approach, Orca, that predicts genome 3D architecture from kilobase to whole-chromosome scale, covering structures including chromatin compartments and topologically associating domains. Orca also makes both intrachromosomal and interchromosomal predictions and captures the sequence dependencies of diverse types of interactions, from CTCF-mediated to enhancer-promoter interactions and Polycomb-mediated interactions. Orca enables the interpretation of the effects of any structural variant at any size on multiscale genome organization and provides an in silico model to help study the sequence-dependent mechanistic basis of genome architecture. We show that the models accurately recapitulate effects of experimentally studied structural variants at varying sizes (300bp-80Mb) using only sequence. Furthermore, these sequence models enable in silico virtual screen assays to probe the sequence-basis of genome 3D organization at different scales. At the submegabase scale, the models predicted specific transcription factor motifs underlying cell-type-specific genome interactions. At the compartment scale, based on virtual screens of sequence activities, we propose a new model for the sequence basis of chromatin compartments: sequences at active transcription start sites are primarily responsible for establishing the expression-active compartment A, while the inactive compartment B typically requires extended stretches of AT-rich sequences (at least 6-12kb) and can form  passively without depending on any particular sequence pattern. Orca thus effectively provides an \"in silico genome observatory\" to predict variant effects on genome structure and probe the sequence-based mechanisms of genome organization.",

Here we examined how the social context influences the learning response during a visual cue discrimination task and the neural activity patterns that underlie acquisition of this novel information. Using the cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, we show that learning of the task is faster in social groups than in a non-social context. We quantified the expression of Fos, an immediate-early gene, across candidate brain regions known to play a role in social behavior and learning, such as the putative teleost homologues of the mammalian hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and medial amygdala/BNST complex. We found that neural activity patterns differ between social and non-social contexts.

Our analysis confirms the geobiochemical predictions for environmental redox gradients within and between hydrothermal systems and stratified lakes and marine environments. Where they are present, a common set of taxonomic groups (Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria and Clostridia) act as drivers of the community-level differences in oxidation state, whereas Flavobacteria most often oppose the overall changes.

    "preprint_abstract": "The early mammalian germ cell lineage is characterized by extensive epigenetic reprogramming, which is required for the maturation into functional eggs and sperm. In particular, the epigenome needs to be reset before parental marks can be established and then transmitted to the next generation. In the female germ line, reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome is one of the most prominent epigenetic reprogramming events, and despite its scale involving an entire chromosome affecting hundreds of genes, very little is known about its kinetics and biological function.\n\nHere we investigate X-chromosome inactivation and reactivation dynamics by employing a tailor-made in vitro system to visualize the X-status during differentiation of primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) from female mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that the degree of X-inactivation in PGCLCs is moderate when compared to somatic cells and characterized by a large number of genes escaping full inactivation. Nevertheless, PGCLCs that fail to undergo X-inactivation show an abnormal gene expression signature and deficiencies in meiotic entry. Subsequent to X-inactivation we observe gradual step-wise X-reactivation, which is mostly completed by the end of meiotic prophase I. Cells deviating from these progressive kinetics and undergoing X-reactivation too rapidly fail to enter a meiotic trajectory. Our data reveals that a fine-tuned X-inactivation and -reactivation cycle is a critical feature of female germ cell developmental competence towards meiosis and oogenesis",

Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (K27M) is a driver mutation in high-grade pediatric gliomas, known to abrogate Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) activity. We applied single-molecule systems to image individual nucleosomes and delineate the combinatorial epigenetic patterns associated with H3-K27M expression. We found that chromatin marks on H3-K27M-mutant nucleosomes are dictated both by their incorporation preferences and by intrinsic properties of the mutation. Mutant nucleosomes not only preferentially bind PRC2, but also directly interact with MLL1, thus leading to genome-wide redistribution of H3K4me3. H3-K27M-mediated deregulation of both repressive and active chromatin marks leads to unbalanced  bivalent chromatin, which may support a poorly differentiated cellular state. This study provides evidence for a direct effect of H3-K27M oncohistone on the MLL1-H3K4me3 pathway and highlights the capability of single-molecule tools to reveal mechanisms of chromatin deregulation in cancer.",

Emerging chemical mutagenesis technology is currently striving to address the challenge of introducing protein post-translational modifications, while maintaining proteins stable and soluble during the modification reaction. Several amyloidogenic proteins are highly aggregation-prone, and current modification procedures lead to unexpected precipitation of these proteins, affecting their yield and downstream characterization. Here, we present a method for maintaining amyloidogenic proteins soluble during chemical mutagenesis.

It is also involved in several neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinsons disease and Multiple System Atrophy, where it forms toxic aggregates. The N-terminus of -synuclein is of particular interest as it has been linked to both the physiological and pathological functions of the protein and undergoes post-translational modification. One such modification, N-terminal truncation, affects the aggregation propensity of the protein in vitro and is also found in aggregates from patients brains. To date, our understanding of the role of this modification has been limited by the many challenges of introducing biologically relevant N-terminal truncations with no overhanging starting methionine. Here, we present a method to produce N-terminally truncated variants of -synuclein that do not carry extra terminal residues. We show that our method can generate highly pure protein to facilitate the study of this modification and its role in physiology and disease. Thanks to this method, we have determined that the first six residues of -synuclein play an important role in the formation of the amyloids.",

The isolation of cells and their seeding on bone autograft is usually carried out in a laboratory, requiring significant time and two separate surgical interventions. Intraoperative creation of tissue-engineered bone autograft can represent a perspective solution. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of creation of tissue-engineered bone autograft by intraoperative enrichment of bone tissue with bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) isolated simultaneously.\n\nMethodsRed bone marrow and autologous bone tissue (bone fragments and bone chips) of the donor were harvested intraoperatively. BM-MNCs were isolated, and bone fragments were enriched with BM-MNCs intraoperatively. Assessment of the adhesion and proliferation of BM-MNCs on bone fragments was carried out by fluorescence microscopy and histological examination. MTT assay was used to compare metabolic activity of BM-MNCs and wBMA cells seeded on bone chips.\n\nResultsAutologous bone fragments were colonized with autologous BM-MNCs isolated simultaneously in the O.R. with further adhesion and active growth of cells. When seeded on bone chips, metabolic activity of BM-MNCs was statistically significantly higher compared to wBMA cells (p-value=0.0272) on day 14. There was no difference in metabolic activity of BM-MNCs and wBMA cells cultured in nutrient medium without bone chips.\n\nConclusionTechnically simple method of intraoperative enrichment of autologous bone fragments with BM-MNCs isolated simultaneously allowed to create tissue-engineered bone autograft in the O.R. The safety and effectiveness of intraoperatively enriched autografts should be investigated further.",

We account for these effects in a minimal two-dimensional model in order to investigate the consequences of mechanical feedback, which is controlled by a critical pressure, pc. A cell can only grow and divide if the pressure it experiences, due to interaction with its neighbors, is less than pc. Because temperature is an irrelevant variable in the model, the cell dynamics is driven by self-generated active forces (SGAFs) that are created by cell division. It is shown that even in the absence of intercellular interactions, cells undergo diffusive behavior. The SGAF-driven diffusion is indistinguishable from the well-known dynamics of a free Brownian particle at a fixed finite temperature. When intercellular interactions are taken into account, we find persistent temporal correlations in the force-force autocorrelation function (FAF) that extends over timescale of several cell division times. The time-dependence of the FAF reveals memory effects, which increases as pc increases. The observed non-Markovian effects emerge due to the interplay of cell division and mechanical feedback, and is inherently a non-equilibrium phenomenon.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are mesenchymal stromal cells that play a crucial role during skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration. FAPs build and maintain the extracellular matrix that acts as a molecular myofiber scaffold. In addition, FAPs are indispensable for myofiber regeneration as they secrete a multitude of beneficial factors sensed by the muscle stem cells (MuSCs). In diseased states, however, FAPs are the cellular origin of intramuscular fat and fibrotic scar tissue. This fatty fibrosis is a hallmark of sarcopenia and neuromuscular diseases, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. One significant barrier in determining why and how FAPs differentiate into intramuscular fat is effective preservation of adipocytes, especially in frozen tissue sections. Conventional methods of skeletal muscle tissue processing, such as snap-freezing, do not properly preserve the morphology of individual adipocytes, thereby preventing accurate visualization and quantification. Here, we describe a protocol that provides robust preservation of adipocyte morphology in skeletal muscle sections allowing visualization, imaging, and quantification of intramuscular fat. We also outline how to process a portion of muscle tissue for RT-qPCR, enabling users to confirm observed changes in fat formation by viewing differences in expression of adipogenic genes. Additionally, we will describe how our protocol can be adopted to visualize adipocytes by whole mount immunofluorescence of muscle samples. Finally, we will outline how to combine this protocol with genetic lineage tracing of Pdgfr-expressing FAPs to study the adipogenic conversion of FAPs. Our protocol consistently yields high-resolution and morphologically accurate immunofluorescent images of adipocytes that, along with confirmation by RT-qPCR, allows for robust, rigorous, and reproducible visualization and quantification of intramuscular fat. Together, our analysis pipeline is the first step to improve our understanding of how FAPs differentiate into intramuscular fat and provides a framework to validate novel interventions to prevent fat formation.",

Through mining of published researches with high-throughput experiment information, the database of differentially expressed miRNAs in human cancers (dbDEMC) was constructed with the aim of providing a systematic resource for the storage and query of the DEMs. Here we report an update of the dbDEMC to version 3.0, containing two-fold more data entries than the previous version, now including also data from mouse and rat. The dbDEMC 3.0 contains 3,268 unique DEMs in 40 different cancer types. The current datasets for differential expression analysis have expanded to 9 generalized categories. Moreover, the current release integrates functional annotations of DEMs obtained from experimentally validated targets. The annotations can greatly benefit integrative analysis of DEMs. In summary, dbDEMC 3.0 provides a valuable resource for characterizing molecular functions and regulatory mechanisms of DEMs in human cancers.

Here, InterSpy is introduced as a synthetic biology tool consisting of a heterodimeric protein engineered to form and maintain membrane-membrane interfaces between apposing synthetic as well as cell membranes through SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction. Inclusion of split fluorescent protein fragments in the designed InterSpy toolkit allows tracking the formation of membrane-membrane interface and reconstitution of functional fluorescent protein in the space between apposing membranes. We first demonstrate InterSpy by testing split protein designs using a mammalian cell-free expression system. By utilizing co-translational helix insertion, cell-free synthesized InterSpy fragments are incorporated into the membrane of liposomes and supported lipid bilayers with a desired topology. Functional reconstitution of split fluorescent protein between the membranes is strictly dependent on SpyTag/SpyCatcher. Finally, since InterSpy is fully genetically encoded, the engineered system is adapted to cells and showcased. InterSpy demonstrates the power of cell-free expression systems in functional reconstitution of synthetic membrane interfaces via proximity-inducing proteins. This technology may also prove useful for synthetic biology where cell-cell contacts and communication are recreated in a controlled manner using minimal components.",

Turtle embryos have several unique features that might play a role in this process, including the carapacial ridge, a Myf5 gene with shorter coding region that generates an alternative splice variant lacking exon 2, and unusual expression patterns of Lbx1 and HGF.\n\nResultsWe generated Myf5 alleles reproducing the Myf5 turtle expression features. At mid gestation, mouse embryos expressing Myf5 lacking exon 2 reproduced some early properties of turtle somites, but still developed into viable and fertile mice. Extending Lbx1 expression into the hypaxial dermomyotomal lip of trunk somites to mimic the turtle Lbx1 expression pattern, produced fusions in the distal part of the ribs.\n\nConclusionsTurtle-like Myf5 activity might generate a plastic state in developing trunk somites under which they can either enter carapace morphogenetic routes, possibly triggered by signals from the carapacial ridge, or still engage in the development of a standard tetrapod ribcage in the absence of those signals. In addition, trunk Lbx1 expression might play a later role in the formation of the lateral border of the carapace.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Potentially pre-malignant lesions (PPOLs) are composed of keratinocytes that are either mortal (MPPOL) or immortal (IPPOL) in vitro. We report here that MPPOL, but not generally IPPOL keratinocytes upregulate various extracellular tumor promoting cytokines (interleukins 6 and 8) and prostaglandins E1 (ePGE1) and E2 (ePGE2) relative to normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs). ePGE upregulation in MPPOL was independent of PGE receptor status, associated with some but not all markers of cellular senescence. Nevertheless, ePGE upregulation was dependent on the senescence program, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and partially regulated by hydrocortisone. Following senescence in the absence of p16INK4A ePGEs accumulated in parallel with a subset of tumor promoting cytokine and metalloproteinase (MMP) transcripts all of which were ablated by ectopic telomerase. Surprisingly, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) function was not required for ePGE upregulation and actually increased in expression in IPPOL keratinocytes in line with its recently reported role in telomerase function. Only ePGE1 was dependent on p53 function suggesting that ePGEs 1 and 2 are regulated differently in oral keratinocytes. We show here that ePGE2 stimulates IPPOL keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. Therefore, we propose that MPPOL keratinocytes promote the progression of IPPOL to oral SCC in a pre-cancerous field by supplying PGEs, interleukins and MMPs in a paracrine manner. Our results suggest that the therapeutic targeting of COX-2 might be enhanced by strategies that target keratinocyte senescence.\n\nSimple SummaryThe early treatment of oral cancer is a high priority, as improvements in this area could lead to greater cure rates and reduced disability due to extensive surgery. Oral cancer is very difficult to detect in over 70% of cases as it develops unseen until quite advanced, sometimes rapidly. It has become apparent that there are at least two types of epithelial cells (keratinocytes) found in oral tissue on the road to cancer (premalignant). One type secretes molecules called prostaglandins but the other does not and the former may stimulate the latter to progress to malignancy, either by stimulating their proliferation or encouraging the influx of blood vessels to feed them. Additionally, we have identified regulators of prostaglandin secretion in premalignant oral cells that could be targeted in future therapies such as inducers of cellular senescence, drugs which kill senescent cells (senolytics), steroid metabolism, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The main goal of the Russian part of C-HPP is to detect and functionally annotate missing proteins (PE2-PE4) encoded by human chromosome 18. However, identifying such proteins in a complex biological mixture using mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods is difficult due to the insufficient sensitivity of proteomic analysis methods. In this study, we determined the proteomic technology sensitivity using a standard set of UPS1 proteins as an example. The results revealed that 100% of proteins in a mixture could only be identified at a concentration of at least 10-9 M. The decrease in concentration leads to protein losses associated with technology sensitivity, and no UPS1 protein is detected at a concentration of 10-13 M. Therefore, two-dimensional fractionation of samples was applied to improve sensitivity. The human liver tissue was examined by selected reaction monitoring and shotgun methods of MS analysis using one-dimensional and two-dimensional fractionation to identify the proteins encoded by human chromosome 18. A total of 134 proteins were identified. The overlap between proteomic and transcriptomic data in human liver tissue was ~50%. This weak convergence is due to the low sensitivity of proteomic technology compared to transcriptomic approaches. Data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026997.",

However, conventional methods used to assess cellular viability in tissue specimens are poorly suited for the evaluation of cancer organoids because they are time-intensive and involve tissue destruction. To address this issue, we established a suite of 3-dimensional patient-derived glioma organoids, treated them with chemoradiotherapy, stained organoids with non-toxic cell dyes, and imaged them using a rapid laser scanning confocal microscopy method termed \"Apex Imaging\". We then developed and tested a fragmentation algorithm to quantify heterogeneity in the topography of the organoids as a potential surrogate marker of viability. This algorithm, SSDquant, provides a 3-dimensional visual representation of the organoid surface and a numerical measurement of the sum-squared distance (SSD) from the derived mass center of the organoid. We tested whether SSD scores correlate with traditional immunohistochemistry-derived cell viability markers (cellularity and cleaved caspase 3 expression) and observed statistically significant associations between them using linear regression analysis. Our work describes a quantitative, non-invasive approach for the serial measurement of patient-derived cancer organoid viability, thus opening new avenues for the application of these models to studies of cancer biology and therapy.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The impact of fitness landscape features on evolutionary outcomes has attracted considerable interest in recent decades. However, evolution often occurs under time-dependent selection in so-called fitness seascapes where the landscape is under flux. Fitness seascapes are an inherent feature of natural environments, where the landscape changes owing both to the intrinsic fitness consequences of previous adaptations and extrinsic changes in selected traits caused by new environments. The complexity of such seascapes may curb the predictability of evolution. However, empirical efforts to test this question utilising a comprehensive set of regimes are lacking. Here we employed an in vitro microbial model system to investigate differences in evolutionary outcomes between time-invariant and -dependent environments, including all possible temporal permutations, with three subinhibitory antimicrobials and a viral parasite (phage) as selective agents. Expectedly, time-invariant environments caused stronger directional selection for resistances compared to time-dependent environments. Intriguingly, however, multidrug resistance outcomes in both cases were largely driven by two strong selective agents (rifampicin and phage) out of four agents in total. These agents either caused cross-resistance or obscured the phenotypic effect of other resistance mutations, modulating the evolutionary outcome overall in time-invariant environments and as a function of exposure epoch in time-dependent environments. This suggests that identifying strong selective agents and their pleiotropic effects is critical for predicting evolution in fitness seascapes, with ramifications for evolutionarily informed strategies to mitigate drug resistance evolution.",

Here, SARS-CoV-2-spike--specific immune responses to Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 were examined longitudinally for 6 months. 100% of individuals made memory CD4+ T cells, with cTfh and CD4-CTL highly represented after mRNA or NVX-CoV2373 vaccination. mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S induced comparable CD8+ T cell frequencies, though memory CD8+ T cells were only detectable in 60-67% of subjects at 6 months. Ad26.COV2.S was not the strongest immunogen by any measurement, though the Ad26.COV2.S T cell, B cell, and antibody responses were relatively stable over 6 months. A differentiating feature of Ad26.COV2.S immunization was a high frequency of CXCR3+ memory B cells. mRNA vaccinees had substantial declines in neutralizing antibodies, while memory T cells and B cells were comparatively stable over 6 months. These results of these detailed immunological evaluations may also be relevant for vaccine design insights against other pathogens.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hierarchical structures constitute a wide array of brain areas, including the visual system. One of the important questions regarding visual hierarchical structures is to identify computational principles for assigning functions that represent the external world to hierarchical structures of the visual system. Given that visual hierarchical structures contain both bottom-up and top-down pathways, the derived principles should encompass these bidirectional pathways. However, existing principles such as predictive coding do not provide an effective principle for bidirectional pathways. Therefore, we propose a novel computational principle for visual hierarchical structures as spatio-temporally efficient coding underscored by the efficient use of given resources in both neural activity space and processing time. This coding principle optimises bidirectional information transmissions over hierarchical structures by simultaneously minimising temporal differences in neural responses and maximising entropy in neural representations. Simulations demonstrated that the proposed spatio-temporally efficient coding was able to assign the function of appropriate neural representations of natural visual scenes to visual hierarchical structures. Furthermore, spatio-temporally efficient coding was able to predict well-known phenomena, including deviations in neural responses to unlearned inputs and bias in preferred orientations. Our proposed spatio-temporally efficient coding may facilitate deeper mechanistic understanding of the computational processes of hierarchical brain structures.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Many organizational principles of structural brain networks are established before birth and undergo considerable developmental changes afterwards. These include the topologically central hub regions and a densely connected rich club. While several studies have mapped developmental trajectories of brain connectivity and brain network organization across childhood and adolescence, comparatively little is known about subsequent development over the course of the lifespan. Here, we present a cross-sectional analysis of structural brain network development in N = 8,066 participants aged 5 to 80 years. Across all brain regions, structural connectivity strength followed an  inverted-U-shaped trajectory with vertex in the early 30s. Connectivity strength of hub regions showed a similar trajectory and the identity of hub regions remained stable across all age groups. While connectivity strength declined with advancing age, the organization of hub regions into a rich club did not only remain intact but became more pronounced, presumingly through a selected sparing of relevant connections from age-related connectivity loss. The stability of rich club organization in the face of overall age-related decline is consistent with a \"first come, last served\" model of neurodevelopment, where the first principles to develop are the last to decline with age. Rich club organization has been shown to be highly beneficial for communicability and higher cognition. A resilient rich club might thus be protective of a functional loss in late adulthood and represent a neural reserve to sustain cognitive functioning in the aging brain.",

One prominent role of anti-microbial autophagy is to degrade intracellular pathogens or microbial molecules, in a process termed xenophagy. Consequently, microbes evolved mechanisms to hijack or modulate autophagy to escape elimination. Although well-described in animals, the extent to which xenophagy contributes to plant-bacteria interactions remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) suppresses host autophagy by utilizing type-III effector XopL. XopL interacts with and degrades the autophagy component SH3P2 via its E3 ligase activity to promote infection. Intriguingly, XopL is targeted for degradation by defense-related selective autophagy mediated by NBR1/Joka2, revealing a complex antagonistic interplay between XopL and the host autophagy machinery. Our results implicate plant antimicrobial autophagy in depletion of a bacterial virulence factor and unravels an unprecedented pathogen strategy to counteract defense-related autophagy.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cryogenic optical localization in three dimensions (COLD) was recently shown to resolve up to four binding sites on a single protein. However, because COLD relies on intensity fluctuations that result from the blinking behavior of fluorophores, it is limited to cases, where individual emitters show different brightness. This significantly lowers the measurement yield. To extend the number of resolved sites as well as the measurement yield, we employ partial labeling and combine it with polarization encoding in order to identify single fluorophores during their stochastic blinking. We then use a particle classification scheme to identify and resolve heterogenous subsets and combine them to reconstruct the three-dimensional arrangement of large molecular complexes. We showcase this method (polarCOLD) by resolving the trimer arrangement of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the hexamer geometry of Caseinolytic Peptidase B (ClpB) of Thermus thermophilus in its quaternary structure, both with Angstrom resolution. The combination of polarCOLD and single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) promises to provide crucial insight into intrinsic, environmental and dynamic heterogeneities of biomolecular structures. Furthermore, our approach is fully compatible with fluorescent protein labeling and can, thus, be used in a wide range of studies in cell and membrane biology.\n\nSignificance statementFluorescence super-resolution microscopy has witnessed many clever innovations in the last two decades. Here, we advance the frontiers of this field of research by combining partial labeling and 2D image classification schemes with polarization-encoded single-molecule localization at liquid helium temperature to reach Angstrom resolution in three dimensions. We demonstrate the performance of the method by applying it to trimer and hexamer protein complexes. Our approach holds great promise for examining membrane protein structural assemblies and conformations in challenging native environments. The methodology closes the gap between electron and optical microscopy and offers an ideal ground for correlating the two modalities at the single-particle level. Indeed, correlative light and electron microscopy is an emerging technique that will provide new insight into cell biology.",

Recently, the usefulness of aquatic eDNA in monitoring the diversity of both terrestrial and aquatic fungi has been suggested. In eDNA studies, different experimental factors, such as DNA extraction kits or methods, can affect the subsequent analyses and the results of DNA metabarcoding. However, few methodological studies have been carried out on eDNA of fungi, and little is known about how experimental procedures can affect the results of biodiversity analysis. In this study, we focused on the effect of DNA extraction method on fungal DNA metabarcoding using freshwater samples obtained from rivers and lakes.\n\nMethodsDNA was extracted from freshwater samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil kit, which is mainly used to extract microbial DNA from soil, and the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit, which is commonly used for eDNA studies on animals. We then compared PCR inhibition and fungal DNA metabarcoding results; i.e., operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number and composition of the extracted samples.\n\nResultsNo PCR inhibition was detected in any of the samples, and no significant differences in the number of OTUs and OTU compositions were detected between the samples processed using different kits. These results indicate that both DNA extraction kits may provide similar diversity results for the river and lake samples evaluated in this study. Therefore, it may be possible to evaluate the diversity of fungi using a unified experimental method, even with samples obtained for diversity studies on other taxa such as those of animals.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Malaria is a potentially fatal infectious disease caused by the obligate intracellular parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite infects human red blood cells (RBC) and derives nutrition by catabolism of hemoglobin. As amino acids are assimilated from the protein component, the toxic heme is released. Molecular heme is detoxified by rapid sequestration to physiologically insoluble hemozoin crystals within the parasites digestive vacuole (DV). Common antimalarial drugs interfere with this crystallization process, leaving the parasites vulnerable to the by-product of their own metabolism. A fundamental debate with important implications on drug mechanism regards the chemical environment of crystallization in vivo, whether aqueous or lipid. This issue had been addressed previously by cryogenic soft X-ray tomography. We employ cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (CSTET) to probe parasite cells throughout the life cycle in a fully hydrated, vitrified state at higher resolution. During the acquisition of CSTET data, Bragg diffraction from the hemozoin provides a uniquely clear view of the crystal boundary at nanometer resolution. No intermediate medium, such as a lipid coating or shroud, could be detected surrounding the crystals. The present study describes a unique application of CSTET in the study of malaria.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, self-fertilizing hermaphrodites can reproduce without a mate and thus prioritize feeding to satisfy the high energetic costs of reproduction. However, males, which rely on finding potential mates for reproduction, sacrifice feeding and instead prioritize exploratory behavior. Here, we demonstrate that these differences in behavior are linked to sexual dimorphism at the cellular level; young males raised on a rich food source show constitutive induction of gut tubular lysosomes, a non-canonical lysosome morphology that typically forms in the gut of young hermaphrodites only when food is limited. We find that male-specific induction of gut tubular lysosomes on abundant food is due to self-imposed dietary restriction through daf-7/TGF{beta} signaling, which promotes mate-searching at the cost of feeding. While gut tubular lysosomes are largely absent from well-fed hermaphrodites at the start of adulthood, their induction accelerates in hermaphrodites in early aging, dependent on the presence of sperm and, partly, on embryo production. These findings identify tubular lysosome induction as a sexually dimorphic cellular event that may integrate animal physiology with sex-specific behavioral differences important for reproductive success.",

The analysed data included age, gender, location and histological diagnosis from fifteen centres covering the majority of the world health organisation (WHO) geographical regions between 2006 and 2019.\n\nResultsA total of 5798 cases were analysed including 65% benign and 35% malignant tumours. A slight female predilection (54%) and peak incidence between the fourth and seventh decade for both benign and malignant tumours was observed. The majority (69%) of the SGT presented in major and 31% in the minor glands. The parotid gland was the most common location (70%) for benign and minor glands (46%) for malignant tumours. Pleomorphic adenoma (70%), and Warthins tumour (17%), were the most common benign tumours whereas mucoepidermoid carcinoma (25%) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (16%) were the most frequent malignant tumours.\n\nConclusionsThis multicentre investigation presents the largest cohort study to date analysing salivary gland tumour data from tertiary centres scattered across the globe. These findings should serve as a baseline for future studies evaluating the epidemiological landscape of these tumours.",

CFTR-W1282X truncated protein retains partial function, so increasing its levels by inhibiting NMD of its mRNA will likely be beneficial. Because NMD regulates the normal expression of many genes, gene-specific stabilization of CFTR-W1282X mRNA expression is more desirable than general NMD inhibition. Synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to prevent binding of exon junction complexes (EJC) downstream of premature termination codons (PTCs) attenuate NMD in a gene-specific manner. We developed a cocktail of three ASOs that specifically increases the expression of CFTR W1282X mRNA and CFTR protein in ASO-transfected human bronchial epithelial cells. This treatment increased the CFTR-mediated chloride current. These results set the stage for clinical development of an allele-specific therapy for CF caused by the W1282X mutation.",

Here we report on a two-dimensional molecular data storage system that records information in both the sequence and the backbone structure of DNA and performs nontrivial joint data encoding, decoding and processing. Our 2DDNA method efficiently stores high-density images in synthetic DNA and embeds pertinent metadata as nicks in the DNA backbone. To avoid costly worst-case redundancy for correcting sequencing/rewriting errors and to mitigate issues associated with mismatched decoding parameters, we develop machine learning techniques for automatic discoloration detection and image inpainting. The 2DDNA platform is experimentally tested by reconstructing a library of images with undetectable or small visual degradation after readout processing, and by erasing and rewriting copyright metadata encoded in nicks. Our results demonstrate that DNA can serve both as a write-once and rewritable memory for heterogenous data and that data can be erased in a permanent, privacy-preserving manner. Moreover, the storage system can be made robust to degrading channel qualities while avoiding global error-correction redundancy.",

Since its spread in humans, secondary host jumps of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to a variety of domestic and wild populations of mammals have been documented. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in different host species is of fundamental interest while also providing indication of how SARS-CoV-2 may have adapted to human hosts soon after the initial host jump, a time window for which there are no genome sequences available. Moreover, the study of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in animals is critical to assess the risk that the transmission of animal-adapted viral lineages back into humans (i.e., spillback) may pose. Here, we compared the genomic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animal species relative to that in humans, profiling the mutational biases indicative of potentially different selective pressures in animals. We focused on viral genomes collected in infected mink (Neovison vison) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for which reports of multiple independent spillover events and subsequent animal-to-animal transmission are available. We identified six candidate mutations for animal-specific adaptation in mink (NSP9_G37E, Spike_F486L, Spike_N501T, Spike_Y453F, ORF3a_T229I, ORF3a_L219V), and one in deer (NSP3a_L1035F), though these mutations appear to confer minimal advantage for circulation in humans. Additionally, circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in mink and deer has not caused considerable changes to the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 thus far. Finally, our results suggest that minimal adaptation was required for human-to-animal spillover and subsequent onward transmission in mink and deer, highlighting the  generalist nature of SARS-CoV-2 as a pathogen of mammalian hosts.",

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the core DISARM complex, DrmAB, both alone and in complex with an unmethylated phage DNA mimetic. These structures reveal that DrmAB core complex is autoinhibited by a trigger loop (TL) within DrmA and binding to DNA substrates containing a 5 overhang dislodges the TL, initiating a long-range structural rearrangement for DrmAB activation. Together with structure-guided in vivo studies, our work provides insights into the mechanism of phage DNA recognition and specific activation of this widespread antiviral defense system.",

Here, we address this gap by measuring the relative fitness of 44 genes horizontally transferred from E. coli to S. Typhimurium strain 4/74 in four infection relevant environments and estimated the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) in each environment. Roughly half of the genes, 40-50%, had significant fitness effects in at least one environment, with most genes showing significant gene by environment (G x E) interactions. We further identified 12 genes with dosage-dependent effects across the four environments, indicating that intolerance of the recipient strain to high protein dosage is a significant barrier to HGT. We also found longer genes had stronger fitness detriments than shorter ones, showing that gene length can significantly hinder HGT. In summary, a substantial fraction of transferred genes had a significant fitness cost on the recipient, with both gene characteristics and the environment providing barriers to HGT.",

Here we studied the mechanics and surface protein expression of beta thalassaemia heterozygous erythrocytes, measured their susceptibility to P. falciparum invasion, and calculated the energy required for merozoites to invade them. We found invasion-relevant differences in beta thalassaemic cells versus matched controls, specifically: elevated membrane tension, reduced bending modulus, and higher levels of expression of the major invasion receptor basigin. However, these differences acted in opposition to each other with respect to their likely impact on invasion, and overall we did not observe beta thalassaemic cells to have lower P. falciparum invasion efficiency for any of the strains tested.",

Here, we investigated how odor information is transformed and represented in higher-order neurons of the lateral horn, one of the higher olfactory centers implicated in determining innate behavior, using Drosophila melanogaster. We focused on a subset of third-order glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) and characterized their odor coding properties in relation to their presynaptic partner neurons, the projection neurons (PNs) by two-photon functional imaging. We found that odors evoke reproducible, stereotypic and odor-specific response patterns in LHNs. Notably, odor-evoked responses in these neurons are valence-specific in a way that their response amplitude is positively correlated with innate odor preferences. We postulate that this valence-specific activity is the result of integrating inputs from multiple olfactory channels through second-order neurons. GRASP and micro-lesioning experiments provide evidence that glutamatergic LHNs obtain their major excitatory input from uniglomerular PNs, while they receive an odor-specific inhibition through inhibitory multiglomerular PNs. In summary, our study indicates that odor representations in glutamatergic LHNs encode hedonic valence and odor identity and primarily retain the odor coding properties of second-order neurons.",

The functioning of the termite gut microbiota is partly understood in a handful of wood-feeding pest species, but remains largely unknown in other taxa. We intend to feel this gap and provide a global understanding of the functional evolution of termite gut microbiota. We sequenced the gut metagenomes of 145 samples representative of the termite diversity. We show that the prokaryotic fraction of the gut microbiota of all termites possesses similar genes for carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolisms, in proportions varying with termite phylogenetic position and diet. The presence of a conserved set of gut prokaryotic genes implies that key nutritional functions were present in the ancestor of modern termites. Furthermore, the abundance of these genes largely correlated with the host phylogeny. Finally, we found that the adaptation to a diet of soil by some termite lineages was accompanied by a change in the stoichiometry of genes involved in important nutritional functions rather than by the acquisition of new genes and pathways. Our results reveal that the composition and function of termite gut prokaryotic communities have been remarkably conserved since termites first appeared [~]150 million years ago. Therefore, the \"world smallest bioreactor\" has been operating as a multipartite symbiosis composed of termites, archaea, bacteria, and cellulolytic flagellates since its inception.",

Specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) co-ordinate the translational regulation of distinct mRNA cohorts during stress. To identify RBPs with previously under-appreciated roles in translational control, we used polysome profiling and mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins associated with translating ribosomes in unstressed yeast cells and during oxidative stress and amino acid starvation, which both induce the integrated stress response (ISR). Over 800 proteins were identified across polysome gradient fractions, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors and many others without previously described translation-related roles, including numerous metabolic enzymes. We identified variations in patterns of polysome enrichment in both unstressed and stressed cells and identified proteins enriched in heavy polysomes during stress. Genetic screening of polysome-enriched RBPs identified the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, Aat2, as a ribosome-associated protein whose deletion conferred growth sensitivity to oxidative stress. Loss of Aat2 caused aberrantly high activation of the ISR via enhanced eIF2 phosphorylation and GCN4 activation. Importantly, non-catalytic AAT2 mutants retained polysome association and did not show heightened stress sensitivity. Aat2 therefore has a separate ribosome-associated translational regulatory or  moonlighting function that modulates the ISR independent of its aspartate aminotransferase activity.",

Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.",

Here, we used two native mass spectrometry (MS) approaches to investigate how the Escherichia coli ammonium transporter (AmtB) and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) selectively remodel their local lipid environment in heterogeneous lipoprotein nanodiscs. First, we used gas-phase ejection to isolate the membrane protein with bound lipids from heterogeneous nanodiscs with different combinations of lipids. Second, we used solution-phase detergent extraction as an orthogonal approach to study membrane protein remodeling of lipids in the nanodisc with native MS. Our results showed that Triton X-100 and LDAO retain lipid selectivity that agrees with gas-phase ejection, but C8E4 distorts some preferential lipid interactions. Both approaches reveal that AmtB has a few selective binding sites for phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids, is selective for binding phosphatidylglycerols (PG) overall, and is nonselective for phosphatidylethanolamines (PE). In contrast, AqpZ prefers either PC or PG over PE and prefers PC over PG. Overall, these experiments provide a detailed picture of how membrane proteins bind different lipid head groups in the context of mixed lipid bilayers.",

They are essential for carrying goods, however globally, overloading is one of the primary welfare concerns of working donkeys. We studied mounted load carrying by donkeys and associated factors in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study of donkey owners (n = 332) was conducted, and interviews were undertaken based on a questionnaire. Owners estimated that the median weight of their donkeys was 110kg (interquartile range (IQR) 100-120kg), and that they carried a median mounted load of 81.5kg (IQR 63-99kg). We found that 87.4% of donkeys carried a load above 50% of their bodyweight ratio (BWR), the median BWR carried was 77.1% (IQR 54.5-90.7%), and 25.3% of donkeys carried above 90% BWR. Donkeys that were loaded at more than 50% BWR were more likely to sit, compared to donkeys loaded with less weight (p=0.01). Donkeys working in peri-urban and urban areas were more likely to carry a greater BWR than donkeys working in rural areas (P<0.001), as were those carrying construction materials or bricks, compared to agricultural materials (p=0.004). Age (p=0.03) and breed (p=0.01) were also associated with carrying a higher weight. Overloading based on current recommendations (50% BWR) was common, with the majority (87.4%) of donkeys reported to carry more than the recommended 50% limit. This survey provides evidence of on-the-ground working practices and factors associated with mounted load carrying, which is critical for developing evidence-based recommendations for loading, in order to improve the welfare of working donkeys.",

While the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity of plant populations in nature has been studied, comparatively little research has investigated the genetics of host effects on their associated microbiomes. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a highly outcrossing, perennial, grass species with substantial locally adaptive diversity across its native North American range. Here, we compared 383 switchgrass accessions in a common garden to determine the host genotypic influence on rhizosphere bacterial composition. We hypothesized that the composition and diversity of rhizosphere bacterial assemblages would differentiate due to genotypic differences between hosts (potentially due to root phenotypes and associated life history variation). We observed higher alpha diversity of bacteria associated with upland ecotypes and tetraploids, compared to lowland ecotypes and octoploids, respectively. Alpha diversity correlated negatively with flowering time and plant height, indicating that bacterial composition varies along switchgrass life history axes. Narrow-sense heritability (h2) of the relative abundance of twenty-one core bacterial families was observed. Overall compositional differences among tetraploids, due to genetic variation, supports wide-spread genotypic influence on the rhizosphere microbiome. Lastly, a genome-wide association study identified 1,861 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with 110 families and genes containing them related to potential regulatory functions. Our findings suggest that switchgrass genomic and life-history variation influences bacterial composition in the rhizosphere, potentially due to host adaptation to local environments.",

Yet <1% of them have been functionally characterized2, leaving most human genome in dark. Here we systematically decode endogenous lncRNAs located in unannotated regions of human genome and decipher a distinctive functional regime of lncRNAs hidden in massive RNAseq data. LncRNAs divergently distribute across chromosomes, independent of protein-coding regions. Their transcriptions barely initiate on promoters through polymerase II, but mostly on enhancers. Yet conventional enhancer activators(e.g. H3K4me1) only account for a small proportion of lncRNA activation, suggesting alternatively unknown mechanisms initiating the majority of lncRNAs. Meanwhile, lncRNA-self regulation also notably contributes to lncRNA activation. LncRNAs trans-regulate broad bioprocesses, including transcription and RNA processing, cell cycle, respiration, response to stress, chromatin organization, post-translational modification, and development. Overall lncRNAs govern their owned regime distinctive from proteins.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The sense of smell is pivotal for nocturnal moths to locate feeding and oviposition sites. However, these crucial resources are often rare and their bouquets are intermingled with volatiles emanating from surrounding  background plants. Here we asked if the olfactory system of female hawkmoths, Manduca sexta, could differentiate between crucial and background cues. To answer this question, we collected nocturnal headspaces of numerous plants in a natural habitat of M. sexta. We analyzed the chemical composition of these headspaces, and used them as stimuli in physiological experiments at the antenna and in the brain. The intense odors of floral nectar sources evoked strong responses in virgin and mated female moths, most likely enabling the localization of profitable flowers at a distance. Bouquets of larval host plants and most background plants, in contrast, were subtle, thus potentially complicating host identification. However, despite being subtle, antennal responses and brain activation patterns evoked by the smell of larval host plants were clearly different from those evoked by other plants. Interestingly, this difference was even more pronounced in the antennal lobe of mated females, revealing a status-dependent tuning of their olfactory system towards oviposition sites. Our study suggests that female moths possess unique neural coding strategies to find not only conspicuous floral cues but also inconspicuous bouquets of larval host plants within a complex olfactory landscape.",

Here, we used directed in vitro evolution of a random library of Uracil glycosylase (eUNG) displayed on yeast surface to select for binding to chaperones GroEL, DnaK+DnaJ+ATP (DnaKJ) or E.coli cell extract (CE). Using binding to the eUNG inhibitor Ugi as probe for native foldedess, the CE selected population was further divided to Ugi binders (+U) (native) or non-binders (-U). We found that GroEL, DnaKJ and CE-U select and enrich for mutations causing eUNG to misfold, with the three being enriched in mutations in buried and conserved positions, with a tendency to increase positive charge. Still, each selection, as well as CE+U and natural evolution of eUNG has its own trajectory. While GroEL and CE-U selected for mutants highly sensitive to protease cleavage, DnaKJ selected for partially structured misfolded species with a tendency to refold, making them less sensitive to proteases. CE+U selected for more neutral mutations than natural evolution. In a more general context, our results show that GroEL has a higher tendency to purge promiscuous misfolded protein mutants from the system, while DnaKJ binds mutants misfolding-prone species that are, upon chaperone release, more likely to natively refold. CE-U shares some of the properties of GroEL and DnaKJ selected populations, while harboring also unique properties, explained by the existence of additional chaperones in CE, such as Tig, HtpG and ClpB.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Satellite DNA spans megabases of eukaryotic sequence and evolves rapidly. Paradoxically, satellite-rich genomic regions mediate strictly conserved, essential processes like chromosome segregation and nuclear structure. A leading resolution to this paradox posits that satellite DNA and satellite-associated chromosomal proteins coevolve to preserve these essential functions. We experimentally test this model of intra-genomic coevolution by conducting the first evolution-guided manipulation of both chromosomal protein and DNA satellite. The 359bp satellite spans an 11Mb array in D. melanogaster that is absent from its sister species, D. simulans. This species-specific DNA satellite colocalizes with the adaptively evolving, ovary-enriched protein, Maternal Haploid (MH)-the Drosophila homolog of Spartan. To determine if MH and 359 coevolve, we swapped the D. simulans version of MH (\"MH[sim]\") into D. melanogaster. MH[sim] triggers ovarian cell death, reduced ovary size, and loss of mature eggs. Surprisingly, the D. melanogaster mh null mutant has no such ovary phenotypes, suggesting that MH[sim] is toxic in a D. melanogaster background. Using both cell biology and genetics, we discovered that MH[sim] poisons oogenesis through a DNA damage pathway. Remarkably, deleting the D. melanogaster-specific 359 satellite array completely restores mh[sim] germline genome integrity and fertility, consistent with a history of coevolution between these two fast-evolving loci. Germline genome integrity and fertility are also restored by overexpressing Topoisomerase II (Top2), suggesting that MH[sim] interferes with Top2-mediated processing of 359. The observed 359-MH[sim] cross-species incompatibility supports a model under which ostensibly inert repetitive DNA and essential chromosomal proteins must coevolve to preserve germline genome integrity.",

They share properties with progenitor-exhausted CD8 T cells and are required for the continued generation of Teff cells as antigen persists.

    "preprint_abstract": "Striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) transform convergent excitatory corticostriatal inputs into an inhibitory signal that shapes basal ganglia output. This process is fine-tuned by striatal GABAergic interneurons (GINs), which receive overlapping cortical inputs and mediate rapid corticostriatal feedforward inhibition of SPNs. Adding another level of control, cholinergic interneurons (CINs), which are also vigorously activated by corticostriatal excitation, can disynaptically inhibit SPNs by activating 4{beta}2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on various GINs. Measurements of this disynaptic inhibitory pathway, however, indicate that it is too slow to compete with direct GIN-mediated feed-forward inhibition. Moreover, functional nAChRs are also present on populations of GINs that respond only weakly to phasic activation of CINs, such as parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PV-FSIs), making the overall role of nAChRs in shaping striatal synaptic integration unclear. Using acute striatal slices we show that upon synchronous optogenetic activation of corticostriatal projections blockade of 4{beta}2 nAChRs shortened SPN spike latencies and increased postsynaptic depolarizations. The nAChR-dependent inhibition was mediated by downstream GABA release, and data suggest that the GABA source was not limited to GINs that respond strongly to phasic CIN activation. In particular, the observed decrease in spike latency caused by nAChR blockade was associated with a diminished frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in SPNs, a parallel hyperpolarization of PV-FSIs, and was occluded by pharmacologically preventing cortical activation of PV-FSIs. Taken together, we describe a role for tonic (as opposed to phasic) activation of nAChRs in striatal function. We conclude that tonic activation of nAChRs by CINs maintains a GABAergic brake on cortically-driven striatal output by \"priming\" feedforward inhibition, a process that may shape SPN spike timing, striatal processing and synaptic plasticity.\n\nImpact StatementA novel mechanism describing how tonic activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can modulate the timing of striatal output by priming feed forward inhibition.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Brain signal decoding promises significant advances in the development of clinical brain computer interfaces (BCI). In Parkinsons disease (PD), first bidirectional BCI implants for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) are now available. Brain signal decoding can extend the clinical utility of adaptive DBS but the impact of neural source, computational methods and PD pathophysiology on decoding performance are unknown. This represents an unmet need for the development of future neurotechnology. To address this, we developed an invasive brain-signal decoding approach based on intraoperative sensorimotor electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic LFP to predict grip-force, a representative movement decoding application, in 11 PD patients undergoing DBS. We demonstrate that ECoG is superior to subthalamic LFP for accurate grip-force decoding. Gradient boosted decision trees (XGBOOST) outperformed other model architectures. ECoG based decoding performance negatively correlated with motor impairment, which could be attributed to subthalamic beta bursts in the motor preparation and movement period. This highlights the impact of PD pathophysiology on the neural capacity to encode movement kinematics. Finally, we developed a connectomic analysis that could predict grip-force decoding performance of individual ECoG channels across patients by using their connectomic fingerprints. Our study provides a neurophysiological and computational framework for invasive brain signal decoding to aid the development of an individualized precision-medicine approach to intelligent adaptive DBS.\n\nSignificance StatementNeurotechnology will revolutionize the treatment of neurological and psychiatric patients, promising novel treatment avenues for previously intractable brain disorders. However, optimal surgical and computational approaches and their interactions with neurological disorders are unknown. How can recent advances in machine learning and connectomics aid the precision and performance of invasive brain signal decoding strategies? Do the brain disorders treated with such approaches have impact on decoding performance? We propose a real time compatible advanced machine learning pipeline for invasively recorded brain signals in Parkinsons disease (PD) patients. We report optimal movement decoding strategies with respect to signal source, model architecture and connectomic fingerprint and demonstrate that PD pathophysiology significantly and negatively impacts movement decoding. Our study has broad impacts for the development of smart brain implants for the treatment of PD and other brain disorders.",

Extensive left temporal damage can impair patients visual mental imagery experience, but the critical locus of lesion is unknown. Our recent meta-analysis of 27 fMRI studies of visual mental imagery highlighted a well-delimited region in the left lateral midfusiform gyrus, which was consistently activated during visual mental imagery, and which we called the Fusiform Imagery Node (FIN). Here we describe the connectional anatomy of FIN in neurotypical participants and in RDS, a right-handed patient with an extensive occipitotemporal stroke in the left hemisphere. The stroke provoked right homonymous hemianopia, alexia without agraphia, and color anomia. Despite these deficits, RDS had normal subjective experience of visual mental imagery and reasonably preserved behavioral performance on tests of visual mental imagery of object shape, object color, letters, faces, and spatial relationships. We found that the FIN was spared by the lesion. We then assessed the connectional anatomy of the FIN in the MNI space and in the patients native space, by visualizing the fibers of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) passing through the FIN. In both spaces, the ILF connected the FIN with the anterior temporal lobe, and the AF linked it with frontal regions. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the FIN is a node of a brain network dedicated to voluntary visual mental imagery. The FIN could act as a bridge between visual information and semantic knowledge processed in the anterior temporal lobe and in the language circuits.",

However, development of green processing methods that meet these criteria remains a major research challenge. Here, we harness microbial biofabrication of nanocellulose and draw inspiration from ancient textile techniques to engineer sustainable biotextiles with a circular life cycle. The unique molecular self-organization of microbial nanocellulose (MC) combined with bio-phosphorylation with a lecithin treatment yields a compostable material with superior mechanical and flame-retardant properties. Specifically, treatment of MC with a lecithin-phosphocholine emulsion makes sites available to modulate cellulose cross-linking through hydroxyl, phosphate and methylene groups, increasing the interaction between cellulose chains. The resultant bioleather exhibits enhanced tensile strength and high ductility. Bio-phosphorylation with lecithin also redirects the combustion pathway from levoglucosan production towards the formation of foaming char as an insulating oxygen barrier, for outstanding flame retardance. Controlled color modulation is demonstrated with natural dyes. Life cycle impact assessment reveals that MC bioleather has up to an order of magnitude lower carbon footprint than conventional textiles, and a thousandfold reduction in the carcinogenic impact of leather production. Eliminating the use of hazardous substances, these high performance materials disrupt linear production models and strategically eliminate its toxicity and negative climate impacts, with widespread application in fashion, interiors and construction. Importantly, the biotextile approach developed in this study demonstrates the potential of biofabrication coupled with green chemistry for a circular materials economy.",

We use both vector spherical harmonics and eigenspectra to quantify how well an array can separate neuronal signal from environmental interference while adequately sampling the entire cortex. We found that triaxial OPMs have superb noise rejection properties allowing for very high orders of interference (L=6) to be accounted for while minimally affecting the neural space (2dB attenuation for a 60-sensor triaxial system). To adequately model the signals arising from the cortex, we show that at least 11th order (143 spatial degrees of freedom) irregular solid harmonics or 95 eigenvectors of the lead field are needed to model the neural space for OPM data (regardless of number of axes measured). This can be adequately sampled with 75-100 equidistant triaxial sensors (225-300 channels) or 200 equidistant radial channels. In other words, ordering the same number of channels in triaxial (rather than purely radial) configuration gives significant advantages not only in terms of external noise rejection but also minimizes cost, weight and cross-talk.",

This toxin has an unusual biology in that it is produced by Salmonella Typhi only when located within host cells. Once synthesized, the toxin is secreted to the lumen of the Salmonella-containing vacuole from where it is transported to the extracellular space by vesicle carrier intermediates. Here we report the identification of the typhoid toxin sorting receptor and the cellular machinery that packages the toxin into vesicle carriers, and exports it to the extracellular space. We found that the cation- independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor serves as typhoid toxin sorting receptor and that the coat protein COPII and the GTPase Sar1 mediate its packaging into vesicle carriers. Formation of the typhoid toxin carriers requires the specific environment of the Salmonella Typhi-containing vacuole, which is determined by the activities of specific effectors of its type III protein secretion systems. We also found that Rab11B and its interacting protein Rip11 control the intracellular transport of the typhoid toxin carriers, and the SNARE proteins VAMP7, SNAP23, and Syntaxin 4 their fusion to the plasma membrane. Typhoid toxins cooption of specific cellular machinery for its transport to the extracellular space illustrates the remarkable adaptation of an exotoxin to exert its function in the context of an intracellular pathogen.",

The genetic diversity of Ethiopian barley likely results from the highly diverse topography, altitude, climate conditions, soil types, and farming systems. To get detailed information on the genetic diversity a panel of 260 accessions, comprising 239 landraces and 21 barley breeding lines, obtained from the Ethiopian biodiversity institute (EBI) and the national barley improvement program, respectively were studied for their genetic diversity using the 50k iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 983 highly informative SNP markers were used for structure and diversity analysis. Three genetically distinct clusters were obtained from the structure analysis comprising 80, 71, and 109 accessions, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed the presence of higher genetic variation (89%) within the clusters than between the clusters (11%), with moderate genetic differentiation (PhiPT=0.11) and adequate gene flow (Nm=2.02). The Mantel test revealed that the genetic distance between accessions is poorly associated with their geographical distance. Despite the observed weak correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation, for some regions like Gonder, Jimma, Gamo-Gofa, Shewa, and Welo, more than 50% of the landraces derived from these regions are assigned to one of the three clusters.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Globally, leopards are the most widespread large felid. However, mounting anthropogenic threats are rapidly reducing viable leopard populations and their range. Despite the clear pressures facing this species, there is a dearth of robust and reliable population and density estimates for leopards across their range, which is particularly important in landscapes that consist of protected and non-protected areas. We conducted a camera trapping survey between 2017 and 2018 in the Western Cape, South Africa to estimate the occupancy, density, and population size of a leopard population. Leopards were recorded at 95% of camera trapping sites, which resulted in a high occupancy that showed no significant variation between seasons, habitat types, or along an altitudinal gradient. Our results indicated a low leopard density in the study area, with an estimated 1.53 leopards/100 km2 in summer and 1.62 leopards/100 km2 in winter. Mean leopard population size was therefore estimated at 107 and 113 individuals in the winter and summer respectively. Leopard activity centres for female ranges were centred in the core study area and could be predicted with good certainty, while males appeared to move out of the study area during winter which resulted in a higher uncertainty in locations of activity centres. Interestingly, livestock depredation events in the surrounding farmlands were significantly higher in winter, which coincides with male leopards moving outside the core protected area into the surrounding farmlands. To reduce livestock losses and retaliatory leopard killings, we suggest that human-carnivore conflict mitigation measures be intensely monitored during the winter months in the study area. We also suggest that future leopard conservation efforts should focus on privately-owned land as these non-protected areas contain the majority of the remaining suitable leopard habitat and may provide important dispersal corridors and buffer zones on which the long-term sustainability of leopard populations depends.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Shaded plants challenged with herbivores or pathogens prioritize growth over defense. However, most experiments have focused on the effect of shading light cues on defense responses. To investigate the potential interaction between shade-avoidance and wounding-induced Jasmonate (JA)-mediated signaling on leaf growth and movement, we used repetitive mechanical wounding of leaf blades to mimic herbivore attacks. Phenotyping experiments with combined treatments on Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes revealed that shade strongly inhibits the wound effect on leaf elevation. By contrast, petiole length is reduced by wounding both in the sun and in the shade. Thus, the relationship between the shade and wounding/JA pathways varies depending on the physiological response, implying that leaf growth and movement can be uncoupled. Using RNA-sequencing, we identified genes with expression patterns matching the hyponastic response (opposite regulation by both stimuli, interaction between treatments with shade dominating the wound signal). Among them were genes from the PKS (Phytochrome Kinase Substrate) family, which was previously studied for its role in phototropism and leaf positioning. Interestingly, we observed reduced shade suppression of the wounding effect in pks2pks4 double mutants while a PKS4 overexpressing line showed constitutively elevated leaves and was less sensitive to wounding. Our results indicate a trait-specific interrelationship between shade and wounding cues on Arabidopsis leaf growth and positioning. Moreover, we identify PKS genes as integrators of external cues in the control of leaf hyponasty further emphasizing the role of these genes in aerial organ positioning.\n\nAuthor summaryPlants face different types of stressful situations without the ability to relocate to favorable environments. For example, increasing plant density reduces access to sunlight as plants start to shade each other. Foliar shading represents a stress that many plants cope with by changing their morphology. This includes elongation of stem-like structures and repositioning of leaves to favor access to unfiltered sunlight. Plants also defend themselves against various pathogens including herbivores. Defense mechanisms include the production of deterrent chemical and morphological adaptations such as stunted growth and downwards leaf repositioning. Here we studied the morphological response of plants when simultaneously facing shade and herbivore stress. When facing both stresses petiole growth was intermediate between the shade-enhanced and wound-repressed response. In contrast, the shade cue overrides the wounding cue leading to a similar upwards leaf repositioning in the combined treatments or in the response to shade alone. Using gene expression analyses and genetics we identified two members of the Phytochrome Kinase Substrate family as playing a signal integration role when plants simultaneously faced both stresses. This contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant morphological adaptations when facing multiple stresses.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The evolutionary variability of a proteins residues is highly dependent on protein region and function. Solvent-exposed residues, excluding those at interaction interfaces, are more variable than buried residues whereas active site residues are considered to be conserved. The abovementioned rules apply also to /{beta}-hydrolase fold proteins - one of the oldest and the biggest superfamily of enzymes with buried active sites equipped with tunnels linking the reaction site with the exterior. We selected soluble epoxide hydrolases as representative of this family to conduct the first systematic study on the evolution of tunnels. We hypothesised that tunnels are lined by mostly conserved residues, and are equipped with a number of specific variable residues that are able to respond to evolutionary pressure. The hypothesis was confirmed, and we suggested a general and detailed way of the tunnels evolution analysis based on entropy values calculated for tunnels residues. We also found three different cases of entropy distribution among tunnel-lining residues. These observations can be applied for protein reengineering mimicking the natural evolution process. We propose a  perforation mechanism for new tunnels design via the merging of internal cavities or protein surface perforation. Based on the literature data, such a strategy of new tunnel design could significantly improve the enzymes performance and can be applied widely for enzymes with buried active sites.\n\nAuthor SummarySo far very little is known about proteins tunnels evolution. The goal of this study is to evaluate the evolution of tunnels in the family of soluble epoxide hydrolases - representatives of numerous /{beta}-hydrolase fold enzymes. As a result two types of tunnels evolution analysis were proposed (a general and a detailed approach), as well as a  perforation mechanism which can mimic native evolution in proteins and can be used as an additional strategy for enzymes redesign.",

However, the moon provides similarly regular time information, and increasingly studies report correlations between diel behavior and lunidian cycles. Yet, mechanistic insight into the possible influences of the moon on ~24hr timers is scarce.\n\nWe studied Platynereis dumerilii and uncover that the moon, besides its role in monthly timing, also schedules the exact hour of nocturnal swarming onset to the nights darkest times. Moonlight adjusts a plastic clock, exhibiting <24h (moonlit) or >24h (no moon) periodicity. Abundance, light sensitivity, and genetic requirement indicate Platynereis r-Opsin1 as receptor to determine moonrise, while the cryptochrome L-Cry is required to discriminate between moon- and sunlight valence. Comparative experiments in Drosophila suggest that Cryptochromes requirement for light valence interpretation is conserved. Its exact biochemical properties differ, however, between species with dissimilar timing ecology.\n\nOur work advances the molecular understanding of lunar impact on fundamental rhythmic processes, including those of marine mass spawners endangered by anthropogenic change.",

Recent studies have identified a role for metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial function in promoting the longevity of memory T cells. However, detailed mechanisms involved in promoting the rapid recall response are incompletely understood. Here we identify a novel role for the initial and continued activation of the trifunctional rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) as critical in promoting the rapid recall response of previously-activated CD8+ T cells. CAD is rapidly phosphorylated upon T cell activation in an mTORC1-dependent manner yet remains phosphorylated long after initial activation. Previously-activated CD8+ T cells display continued de novo pyrimidine synthesis in the absence of mitogenic signals and interfering with this pathway diminishes the speed and magnitude of cytokine production upon rechallenge. Inhibition of CAD does not affect cytokine transcript levels, but diminishes available pre-rRNA, the polycistronic rRNA precursor whose synthesis is the rate-limiting step in ribosomal biogenesis. CAD inhibition additionally decreases levels of detectable ribosomal proteins in previously-activated CD8+ T cells. Overexpression of CAD improves both the cytokine response and proliferation of memory T cells. Overall, our studies reveal a novel and critical role for CAD-induced pyrimidine synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis in promoting the rapid recall response characteristic of memory T cells.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPyrimidine synthesis fuels ribosomal biogenesis to facilitate rapid recall responses in CD8+ T cells",

However, to date the only methods for imaging these cells in vivo involve either invasive procedures (e.g. multi-photon imaging in rodents) or TSPO-PET radiotracers, which afford low resolution and specificity, since TSPO expresses across multiple cell types. Here, we present a non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI method to image changes in glia morphometry in vivo. Using two rat models of neuroinflammation, with and without neurodegeneration, we demonstrate that diffusion-weighted MRI carries the fingerprint of microglia and astrocytes activation, and that specific signatures from each population can be quantified non-invasively. We demonstrate that the method can further detect glia proliferation, and provide a quantitative account of neuroinflammation regardless of the existence of a concomitant neuronal loss. We prove the translational value of the approach showing significant correlations between MRI and histological microglia markers measured across different brain regions in humans. This framework holds the potential to transform basic and clinical research by providing a tool to clarify the role of inflammation in health and disease across the lifespan.",

Previous samplings have found that karstic formations (i.e., caves and folds formed by the erosion of limestone) serve as a natural habitat to sandfly species. The majority of samplings of cave sandfly diversity have occurred in Brazil and to date none have studied the species composition in a cave in the Northern Andes. We collected sandflies in the Cave \"Los Guacharos\", in the state of Antioquia, Colombia. The sampling was carried out during two consecutive nights in September 2019. CDC-type light traps were installed inside the cavern and in other surrounding karst systems (caves and folds). In total, we identified 18 species of sandfly from the cave and surrounding karst systems, including three new records for Colombia (Bichromomyia olmeca nociva, Brumptomyia brumpti, and Warileya leponti), and provide the first karstic reports for four other species (Lutzomyia gomezi, Lutzomyia hartmanni, Pintomyia ovallesi, and Psychodopygus panamensis). We then used the results of our survey and published literature to test two hypotheses. First, that sandfly diversity in Neotropical caves is richest nearer to the equator and second that there is a phylogenetic signal of karstic habitat use in sandflies. Counter to our predictions, we found no evidence that diversity follows a latitudinal gradient. Further, we find no evidence of a phylogenetic signal of karstic habitat use, instead finding that the use of caves likely evolved multiple times across several genera. Our results highlight the importance of a wide sampling to understand the natural habitat of sandflies and other disease vectors.",

A full understanding of proteome changes therefore requires a definition of the roles of these two processes in proteostasis, collectively known as protein turnover. Because protein turnover occurs even in the absence of overt changes in pool abundance, turnover measurements necessitate monitoring the flux of stable isotope labeled precursors through the protein pool such as labeled amino acids or metabolic precursors such as ammonium chloride or heavy water. In cells in culture, the ability to manipulate precursor pools by rapid medium changes is simple, but for more complex systems such as intact animals, the approach becomes more convoluted. Individual methods bring specific complications, and the suitability of different methods has not been comprehensively explored. In this study we compare the turnover rates of proteins across four mouse tissues, obtained from the same inbred mouse strain maintained under identical husbandry conditions, measured using either [13C6]lysine or [2H2]O as the labeling precursor. We show that for long-lived proteins, the two approaches yield essentially identical measures of the first order rate constant for degradation. For short-lived proteins, there is a need to compensate for the slower equilibration of lysine through the precursor pools. We evaluate different approaches to provide that compensation. We conclude that both labels are suitable, but careful determination of precursor enrichment kinetics in amino acid labeling is critical and has a considerable influence on the numerical values of the derived protein turnover rates.",

These associations were further confirmed and analyzed by CRISPR-tagging of endogenous proteins and comparison of expressed isoforms. Importantly, based on structural information, point mutations could be introduced that can specifically disrupt MRG15 association with some complexes but not others. Most interestingly, we also identified a new abundant native complex formed by MRG15/X-MRGBP-BRD8-EP400NL that is functionally similar to the yeast TINTIN (Trimer Independent of NuA4 for Transcription Interactions with Nucleosomes) complex. Our results show that EP400NL, being homologous to the N-terminal region of NuA4/TIP60 subunit EP400, creates TINTIN by competing for BRD8 association. Functional genomics indicate that human TINTIN plays a role in transcription of specific genes. This is most likely linked to the H4ac-binding bromodomain of BRD8 along the H3K36me3-binding chromodomain of MRG15 on the coding region of transcribed genes. Taken together, our data provide a complete detailed picture of human MRG proteins-associated protein complexes which is essential to understand and correlate their diverse biological functions in chromatin-based nuclear processes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMRG15 and MRGX are stably associated with several different protein complexes important for genome expression and stability.\nC_LIO_LISeveral MRG-containing complexes are chromatin modifiers.\nC_LIO_LISpecific point mutations in the MRG domain differentially affect associated complexes.\nC_LIO_LIA major human complex homologous to the yeast TINTIN complex is identified.\nC_LIO_LIThe protein EP400NL competes with EP400 to functionally separate TINTIN from the NuA4/TIP60 complex.\nC_LIO_LITINTIN contains a bromodomain and a chromodomain to regulate transcription.\nC_LI",

The vast majority of common trait-associated variants identified via GWAS fall in non-coding regions of the genome, posing a challenge in elucidating the causal variants, genes, and mechanisms involved. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and other molecular QTL studies have been valuable resources in identifying candidate causal genes from GWAS loci through statistical colocalization methods. While QTL colocalization is becoming a standard analysis in post-GWAS investigation, an easy web tool for users to perform formal colocalization analyses with either user-provided or public GWAS and eQTL datasets has been lacking. Here, we present ezQTL, a web-based bioinformatic application to interactively visualize and analyze genetic association data such as GWAS and molecular QTLs under different linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns (1000 Genomes Project, UK Biobank, or user-provided data). This application allows users to perform data quality control for variants matched between different datasets, LD visualization, and two-trait colocalization analyses using two state-of-the-art methodologies (eCAVIAR and HyPrColoc), including batch processing. ezQTL is a free and publicly available cross-platform web tool, which can be accessed online at https://analysistools.cancer.gov/ezqtl.",

Two SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines (IAVs), one recombinant protein subunit vaccine (PRV), and one adenovirus-vectored vaccine (AdV) have been widely administrated in many countries including China to pursue herd immunity. Here we investigated cross-neutralizing activities in 341 human serum specimens elicited by full-course vaccinations with IAV, PRV and AdV, and by various vaccine boosters following prime IAV and AdV vaccinations. We found that all types of vaccines induced significantly lower neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron variant than against the prototype strain. For prime vaccinations with IAV and AdV, heterologous boosters with AdV and PRV, respectively, elevated serum Omicron-neutralizing activities to the highest degrees. In a mouse model, we further demonstrated that among a series of variant-derived RBD-encoding mRNA vaccine boosters, it is only the Omicron booster that significantly enhanced Omicron neutralizing antibody titers compared with the prototype booster following a prime immunization with a prototype S-encoding mRNA vaccine candidate. In summary, our systematical investigations of various vaccine boosters inform potential booster administrations in the future to combat the Omicron variant.",

Frequently, cell identity is determined by aligning and matching tags to an \"atlas\" of labeled neuronal positions and other identifying characteristics. Previous analyses of such C. elegans datasets have been hampered by the limited accuracy of such atlases, especially for neurons present in the ventral nerve cord, and also by time-consuming manual elements of the alignment process. We present a novel automated alignment method for sparse and incomplete point clouds of the sort resulting from typical C. elegans fluorescence microscopy datasets. This method involves a tunable learning parameter and a kernel that enforces biologically realistic deformation. We also present a pipeline for creating alignment atlases from datasets of the recently developed NeuroPAL transgene. In combination, these advances allow us to label neurons in volumetric images with confidence much higher than previous methods. We release, to the best of our knowledge, the most complete C. elegans 3D positional neuron atlas, encapsulating positional variability derived from 7 animals, for the purposes of cell-type identity prediction for myriad applications (e.g., imaging neuronal activity, gene expression, and cell-fate).",

Here, we serologically investigated 493 wild ruminant samples collected in the 2021/22 hunting season in Germany for the presence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and four viruses pathogenic for domestic ruminants, namely the orthobunyavirus Schmallenberg virus (SBV), the reovirus bluetongue virus (BTV) and ruminant pestiviruses like bovine viral diarrhoea virus or border disease virus. The animal species comprised fallow deer, red deer, roe deer, mouflon and wisent. For coronavirus serology, additional 307 fallow, roe and red deer samples collected between 2017 and 2020 at three military training areas were included. While antibodies against SBV could be detected in about 13.6% of the samples collected in 2021/22, only one fallow deer of unknown age tested positive for anti-BTV antibodies and all samples reacted negative for antibodies against ruminant pestiviruses. In an ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, 25 out of 493 (5.1%) samples collected in autumn and winter 2021/22 scored positive. This sero-reactivity could not be confirmed by the highly specific virus neutralization test, occurred also in 2017, 2018 and 2019, i.e. prior to the human SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and was likewise observed against the RBD of the related SARS-CoV-1. Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2-seroreactivity was most likely induced by another, hitherto unknown deer virus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus of betacoronaviruses.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene is critical for the appropriate establishment of central immune tolerance. As one of the main controllers of promiscuous gene expression in the thymus, Aire promotes the expression of thousands of downstream tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) genes, cell adhesion genes and transcription factor genes in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Despite the increasing knowledge about the role of Aire as an upstream transcriptional controller, little is known about the mechanisms by which this gene could be regulated.\n\nResultsHere, we assessed the posttranscriptional control of Aire by miRNAs. The in silico miRNA-mRNA interaction analysis predicted thermodynamically stable hybridization between the 3' UTR of Aire mRNA and miR-155, which was confirmed to occur within the cellular milieu through a luciferase reporter assay. This finding enabled us to hypothesize that miR-155 might play a role as an intracellular posttranscriptional regulator of Aire mRNA. To test this hypothesis, we transfected a murine mTEC cell line with a miR-155 mimic in vitro, which reduced the mRNA and protein levels of Aire. Moreover, large-scale transcriptome analysis showed the modulation of 311 downstream mRNAs, which included 58 TRA mRNAs. Moreover, miR-155 mimic-transfected cells exhibited a decrease in their chemotaxis property compared with control thymocytes.\n\nConclusionOverall, the results indicate that miR-155 may posttranscriptionally control Aire mRNA as well as a crucial process by which mTECs allow migration of thymocytes through chemotaxis.",

In some in vivo samples, fine dissections can also be difficult to visualize, but in vitro samples may allow clear imaging. Using a 1040-nm, 400-fs pulsed laser, we performed ablation inside agarose and glass, producing clear and persistent damage spots. Near the ablation threshold of both media, we found that the axial resolution is similar to the transverse resolution. We also ablated neuron cell bodies and fibers in C. elegans and demonstrate submicrometer resolution in both the transverse and axial directions, consistent with our results in agarose and glass. Using simple yet rigorous methods, we define the resolution of laser ablation in transparent media along all directions.",

Autophagy defects could therefore mark a metabolically vulnerable cancer state and open a therapeutic window. While mutations of autophagy genes (ATGs) are notably rare in cancer, haploinsufficiency network analyses across many cancers have shown that the autophagy pathway is frequently hit by somatic copy number losses of ATGs like MAP1LC3B/ATG8F (LC3), BECN1/ATG6 (Beclin-1), and ATG10. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to delete increasing numbers of copies of one or more of these ATGs in non-small cell lung cancer cells and examined the effects on sensitivity to compounds targeting aerobic glycolysis, a hallmark of cancer metabolism. Whereas complete knock-out of one ATG blocked autophagy and led to profound metabolic vulnerability, this was not the case for combinations of different non-homozygous deletions. In cancer patients, the effect of ATG copy number loss was blunted at the protein level and did not lead to accumulation of p62 as a sign of reduced autophagic flux. Thus, the autophagy pathway is shown to be markedly robust and resilient, even with concomitant copy number loss of key autophagy genes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "One metric of peatland restoration success is the re-establishment of a carbon sink, yet considerable uncertainty remains around the timescale of carbon sink trajectories. Conditions post-restoration may promote the establishment of vascular plants such as graminoids, often at greater density than would be found in undisturbed peatlands, with consequences for carbon storage. Although graminoid species are often considered as a single plant functional type (PFT) in land-atmosphere models, our understanding of functional variation among graminoid species is limited, particularly in a restoration context. We used a traits-based approach to evaluate graminoid functional variation and to assess whether different graminoid species should be considered a single PFT or multiple types. We tested hypotheses that greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4) would vary due to differences in plant traits among five graminoid species in a restored peatland in central Alberta, Canada. We further hypothesized that species would form two functionally distinct groupings based on taxonomy (grass, sedge). Differences in gas fluxes among species were primarily driven by variation in leaf physiology related to photosynthetic efficiency and resource-use, and secondarily by plant size. Multivariate analyses did not reveal distinct functional groupings based on taxonomy or environmental preferences. Rather, we identified functional groups defined by continuous plant traits and carbon fluxes that are consistent with ecological strategies related to differences in growth rate, resource-acquisition, and leaf economics. These functional groups displayed larger carbon storage potential than currently-applied graminoid PFTs. Existing PFT designations in peatland models may be more appropriate for pristine or high-latitude systems than those under restoration. Although replacing PFTs with continuous plant traits remains a challenge in peatlands, traits related to leaf physiology and growth rate strategies offer a promising avenue for future applications.",

ClusTRace was developed as an aid for COVID-19 transmission chain tracing in Finland and the main emphasis has been on fast and unsupervised screening of phylogenies for markers of super-spreading events and other features of concern, such as high rates of cluster growth and/or accumulation of novel mutations.\n\nAvailabilityAll code is freely available from https://bitbucket.org/plyusnin/clustrace/",

    "preprint_abstract": "Incorporating neuroimaging-revealed structural details into finite element (FE) head models opens vast new opportunities to better understand brain injury mechanisms. Recently, growing efforts have been made to integrate fiber orientation from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) into FE models to predict white matter (WM) tract-related deformation that is biomechanically characterized by tract-related strains. Commonly used approaches often downsample the spatially enriched fiber orientation to match the FE resolution with one orientation per element (i.e., element-wise orientation implementation). However, the validity of such downsampling operation and corresponding influences on the computed tract-related strains remain elusive. To address this, the current study proposed a new approach to integrate voxel-wise fiber orientation from one DTI atlas (isotropic resolution of 1 mm3) into FE models by embedding orientations from multiple voxels within one element (i.e., voxel-wise orientation implementation). By setting the responses revealed by the newly proposed voxel-wise orientation implementation as the reference, we evaluated the reliability of two previous downsampling approaches by examining the downsampled fiber orientation and the computationally predicted tract-related strains secondary to one concussive impact. Two FE models with varying element sizes (i.e., 6.37 {+/-} 1.60 mm and 1.28 {+/-} 0.55 mm, respectively) were incorporated. The results showed that, for the model with a large voxel-mesh resolution mismatch, the downsampled element-wise fiber orientation, with respect to its voxel-wise counterpart, exhibited an absolute deviation over 30{degrees} across the WM/gray matter interface and the pons regions. Accordingly, this orientation deviation compromised the computation of tract-related strains with normalized root-mean-square errors up to 30% and underestimated the peak tract-related strains up to 10%. For the other FE model with finer meshes, the downsampling-induced effects were lower, both on the fiber orientation and tract-related strains. Taken together, the voxel-wise orientation implementation is recommended in future studies as it leverages the DTI-delineated fiber orientation to a larger extent than the element-wise orientation implementation. Thus, this study yields novel insights on integrating neuroimaging-revealed fiber orientation into FE models and may better inform the computation of WM tract-related deformation, which are crucial for advancing the etiological understanding and computational predictability of brain injury.\n\nGraphic abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471622v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ebda9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5d624org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e068borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f8ff5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "Naturally occurring structural variations (SVs) are a considerable source of genomic variation and can reshape chromosomes 3D architecture. The synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution (SCRaMbLE) system has been proved to generate random SVs to impact phenotypes and thus constitutes powerful drivers of directed genome evolution. However, how to reveal the molecular mechanism insights into the interactions between phenotypes and complex SVs, especially inversions and translocations, has so far remained challenging. In this study, we develop a SV-prone yeast strain by using SCRaMbLE with two synthetic chromosomes, synV and synX. An heterologous biosynthesis pathway allowing a high throughput screen for increased yield of astaxanthin is used as readout and a proof of concept for the application of SV in industry. We report here that complex SVs, including a pericentric inversion and a trans-chromosomes translocation between synV and synX, result in two neochromosomes and a 2.7-fold yield of astaxanthin. We demonstrated that inversion and inversion reshaped chromosomes 3D architecture and led to large reorganization of the genetic information nearby the breakpoint of the SVs along the chromosomes. Specifically, the pericentric inversion increased the expression of STE18 and the trans-chromosomic translocation increased the expression of RPS5 and MCM22, which contributed to higher astaxanthin yield. We also used the model learned from the aforementioned random screen and successfully harnessed the precise introduction of trans-chromosomes translocation and pericentric inversions by rational design. Overall, our work provides an effective tool to not only accelerate the directed genome evolution but also reveal mechanistic insight of complex SVs for altering phenotypes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Visual cortex organization is highly consistent across individuals. But to what degree does this consistency depend on life experience, in particular sensory experience? In this study, we asked whether visual cortex reorganization in congenital blindness results in connectivity patterns that are particularly variable across individuals, focusing on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns from primary visual cortex. We show that the absence of shared visual experience results in more-variable RSFC patterns across blind individuals than sighted controls. Increased variability is specifically found in areas that show a group difference between the blind and sighted in their RSFC. These findings reveal a relationship between brain plasticity and individual variability in which reorganization manifests variably across individuals. We further investigated the different patterns of reorganization in the blind, showing that the connectivity to frontal regions, proposed to have a role in reorganization of the visual cortex of the blind towards higher cognitive roles, is highly variable. In a supplementary analysis, we link some of the variability in visual-to-frontal connectivity to another environmental factor - duration of formal education. Together, these findings show a role of sensory and socioeconomic experience in imposing consistency on brain organization. By revealing the idiosyncratic nature of neural reorganization, these findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in fitting sensory aids and restoration approaches for vision loss.\n\nSignificance statementThe typical visual system is highly consistent across individuals. What are the origins of this consistency? Comparing the consistency of visual cortex connectivity between people born blind and sighted people, we showed that blindness results in higher variability, suggesting a key impact of individual experience on brain organization. Further, connectivity patterns that changed following blindness were particularly variable, resulting in diverse patterns of brain reorganization. Individual differences in reorganization were also directly affected by non-visual experiences in the blind (years of formal education). Together, these findings show a role of sensory and socioeconomic experiences in creating individual differences in brain organization and endorse the use of individual profiles for rehabilitation and restoration of vision loss.",

However, its association with assembly mechanisms remains largely unknown, particularly under fluctuating disturbances. Here, we subjected complex bacterial communities in bioreactor microcosms to different frequencies of organic loading shocks, tracking temporal dynamics in their assembly, structure and function. Null modelling revealed a stronger role of stochasticity at intermediate disturbance frequencies, preceding the formation of a peak in -diversity. Communities at extreme ends of the disturbance range had the lowest -diversity and highest within-treatment similarity in terms of {beta}-diversity, with stronger deterministic assembly. Stochasticity prevailed during the initial successional stages, coinciding with better specialized function (nitrogen removal). In contrast, general functions (carbon removal and microbial aggregate settleability) benefited from stronger deterministic processes. We showed that changes in assembly processes predictably precede changes in diversity under a gradient of disturbance frequencies, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind disturbance-diversity-function relationships.",

Several hypotheses about optimization of phloem structure and function and limitations of phloem transport under drought have been proposed, and tested with models and anatomical data. However, the true impact of radial water exchange of phloem conduits with their surroundings on mass transport of photosynthates has not been addressed. Here, the physics of the Munch mechanism of sugar transport is re-evaluated to include local variations in viscosity resulting from the radial water exchange in two dimensions (axial and radial). Model results show that radial water exchange pushes sucrose away from conduit walls thereby reducing wall frictional stress due to a decrease in sap viscosity and an increase in sugar concentration in the central region of the conduit. These two co-occurring effects lead to increased sugar front speed and axial mass transport across a wide range of phloem conduit lengths. Thus, sugar transport operates more efficiently than predicted by previous models that ignore these two effects. A faster front speed leads to higher phloem resiliency under drought because more sugar can be transported with a smaller pressure gradient.\n\nSummaryThe overall speed of sap increased by including a concentrationdependent viscosity in axial and radial directions.",

Thus, progression of membranous organelles along traffic routes requires mechanisms to control bilayer lipid chemistry and their abundance relative to proteins. The recent structural and functional characterization of VPS13-family proteins has suggested a mechanism through which lipids can be transferred in bulk from one membrane to another at membrane contact sites, and thus independently of vesicular traffic. Here we show that SHIP164 (UHRF1BP1L) shares structural and lipid transfer properties with these proteins and is localized on a subpopulation of vesicle clusters in the early endocytic pathway whose membrane cargo includes the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) and ATG9. Loss of SHIP164 disrupts retrograde traffic of these organelles to the Golgi complex. Our findings raise the possibility that bulk transfer of lipids to endocytic membranes may play a role in their traffic.",

Disruption in levels of antimicrobial peptides produced by the enteroendocrine cells, such as catestatin, has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota and imbalance in intestinal homeostasis. However, whether the changes in the gut microbiota have a causational role in intestinal dyshomeostasis has remained elusive. To this end, we performed reciprocal fecal microbial transplantation in wild-type mice and mice with a knockout in the catestatin coding region of the chromogranin-A gene (CST-KO mice). Combined microbiota phylogenetic profiling, RNA sequencing, and transmission electron microscopy were employed. Fecal microbiota transplantation from mice deficient in catestatin (CST-KO) to microbiota-depleted wild-type mice induced transcriptional and physiological features characteristic of a distorted colon in the recipient animals, including impairment in tight junctions, as well as an increased collagen area fraction indicating colonic fibrosis. In contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation from wild-type mice to microbiota-depleted CST-KO mice reduced collagen fibrotic area, restored disrupted tight junction morphology, and altered fatty acid metabolism in recipient CST-KO mice. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the murine metabolic- and immune-related cellular pathways and processes that are co-mediated by the fecal microbiota transplantation and supports a prominent role for the gut microbiota in the colonic distortion associated with the lack of catestatin in mice. Overall, the data show that the gut microbiota may play a causal role in the development of features of intestinal inflammation and metabolic disorders, known to be associated with altered levels of catestatin and may, thus, provide a tractable target in the treatment and prevention of these disorders.",

Here, we describe the three-dimensional ground reaction forces and lower/hind limb joint mechanics of human and bipedal chimpanzee walking over a full stride and test whether: 1) the estimated limb joint work and power during stance phase, especially the single-support period, is lower in humans than bipedal chimpanzees, 2) the limb joint work and power required for limb swing is lower in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees, and 3) the estimated total mechanical power during walking, accounting for the storage of passive elastic strain energy in humans, is lower in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees. Humans and bipedal chimpanzees were compared at matched dimensionless and dimensional velocities. Our results indicate that humans walk with significantly less work and power output in the first double-support period and the single-support period of stance, but markedly exceed chimpanzees in the second-double support period (i.e., push-off). Humans generate less work and power in limb swing, although the species difference in limb swing power was not statistically significant. We estimated that total mechanical positive  muscle fiber work and power were 46.9% and 35.8% lower, respectively, in humans than bipedal chimpanzees at matched dimensionless speeds. This is due in part to mechanisms for the storage and release of elastic energy at the ankle and hip in humans. Further, these results indicate distinct heel strike and lateral balance mechanics in humans and bipedal chimpanzees, and suggest a greater dissipation of mechanical energy through soft tissue deformations in humans. Together, our results document important differences between human and bipedal chimpanzee walking mechanics over a full stride, permitting a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanics and energetics of chimpanzee bipedalism and the evolution of hominin walking.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Predation as an important trophic interaction of ecological communities controls the large-scale patterns of species distribution, population abundance and community structure. Numerous studies address that predation can mediate diversity and regulate the ecological community and food web stability through changes in the behaviour, morphology, development, and abundance of prey. Since predation has large effects on persistence and diversity, the local loss or removal of predation in a community can trigger a cascade of extinctions. In ecological theory, the effect of predation removal has been well studied in foodwebs, but it remains unclear in the case of a spatially distributed community connected by dispersal. In this study, the interaction between local and spatial processes is taken into account, we present how a predation turnoff in selective patches affects the stability and persistence of a metacommunity. Using a simple predator-prey metacommunity with a diffusive dispersal, we show the impact of predation on synchronized, asynchronized and source-sink dynamics. Our results reveal that predation turnoff in very few patches alters a perfectly synchronized oscillatory state into multicluster states consisting of various patterns. In a source-sink behaviour, predation turnoff in a source patch reduces the number of sink patches and changes the clusters. In general, predation turnoff in a finite number of patches increases the number of clusters through asynchronized (inhomogeneous) states, whereas predation turnoff in a larger number of patches can lead to the complete extinction of predators. Typically, there exists a critical number of patches below which the predation turnoff results in asynchronized states and above that predation turnoff leads to a synchronized state in prey population with complete extinction of predators. Further, our results identify the network configurations that exhibit a unique number of clusters. Moreover, prey density from the patches where predation is absent goes to a saturating state near the carrying capacity. Thus, this study stresses that predation turnoff in selective patches acts as a stabilizing mechanism that can promote metacommunity persistence.",

Niche shifts during range expansion have been studied extensively in invasive species, but may also occur in native populations tracking climate change. We compared niche shifts during both types of range expansion in a Mediterranean annual plant to ask (i) whether the species native range expansion tracked climate change, (ii) whether further range expansion was promoted by niche expansion, and (iii) how these results changed forecasts of two ongoing invasions in Australia and California.\n\nLocationEurasian Holarctic, California and Australia\n\nTaxonDittrichia graveolens (L.) Greuter (Asteraceae)\n\nMethodsNiche shifts were quantified in both environmental and geographic space, using the framework of niche centroid shift, overlap, unfilling, and expansion (COUE) as well as Maximum Entropy modelling. We used the historic native distribution and climate data (1901-1930) to project the expected distribution in the present climate (1990-2019), and compared it to the observed current distribution of D. graveolens. Finally, we compared invasion forecasts based on the historic and present native niches.\n\nResultsWe found that D. graveolens expanded its native range well beyond what would be sufficient to track climate change, associated with a 5.5% niche expansion towards more temperate climates. In contrast, both invasions showed niche conservatism, and were (still) constrained to climatic areas matching the historic native niche.\n\nMain conclusionsour results show that contrary to hypotheses in the literature, niche shifts are not necessarily more rapid in invasions than in native range expansions. We conclude that niche expansion during the process of climate tracking may cause further range expansion than expected based on climate change alone.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Under the influence of stress and membrane damage, cells undergo immunogenic cell death (ICD), which involves the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), natural adjuvants for enhancing an immune response. In the presence of an antigen, released DAMPs can determine the type and magnitude of the immune response, and therefore the longevity and efficacy of an antigen-specific immunity. In the last decade, the immune response effect of ICD has been shown, yet there is no tool that can induce controlled ICD with predictable results, regardless of the cell type. We designed a peptide-based tool, called [II], for controlled damage to cell membrane to induce ICD and DAMPs release. Herein we describe a series of experiments that determine that the mechanism of action of [II] includes a caspase-dependent ICD and subsequent release of immune stimulating DAMPs, on various cell types. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that controlled DAMP release via [II] in vivo was associated with enhancement of antigen-specific adaptive immunity with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subunit vaccine. HA and [II] showed significantly higher HA specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, compared to HA-only immunized mice, while the peptide itself did not elicit antibodies. In this paper, we demonstrate the first peptide-aggregation induced immunogenic rupture (PAIIR) approach as vaccine adjuvants for increasing both humoral and cellular immunity. In consideration of its ability to enhance IgG2a responses that are associated with heterosubtypic influenza virus protection, PAIIR is a promising adjuvant to promote universal protection upon influenza HA vaccination.",

Most therapies rarely provide clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes of patients with GBM. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging chemotherapeutics with stunning success in cancer management. Although promising, clinical studies of three ADCs for treating GBM, including Depatux-M, have been discontinued because of safety concerns and limited therapeutic benefits. Here, we report that ADC homogeneity is a critical parameter to maximize the therapeutic potential in GBM therapy. We demonstrate that homogeneous conjugates generated using our linker show enhanced drug delivery to intracranial brain tumors. Notably, compared to heterogeneous ADCs, including a Depatux-M analog, our ADCs provide greatly improved antitumor effects and survival benefits in orthotopic brain tumor models, including a patient-derived xenograft model of GBM. Our findings warrant the future development of homogeneous ADCs as promising molecular entities toward cures for intractable brain tumors.",

Current technologies employ a Cas9 that introduces DNA double-strand breaks into the opposing wildtype allele to replace it with a copy of the gene drive allele via DNA homology-directed repair. Yet, the use of different Cas9s versions is unexplored, and alternative approaches could increase the available toolkit for gene-drive designs. Here, we report a novel gene-drive approach that relies on Cas9 nickases that generate staggered paired nicks in DNA to propagate the engineered gene-drive cassette. We show that generating 5 overhangs in the system yields efficient allelic conversion. The nickase gene-drive arrangement produces large, stereotyped deletions that are advantageous for targeting essential genes. Indeed, our nickase approach should expand the repertoire for gene-drive designs aimed at applications in mosquitoes and beyond.",

We identified mixed M. tuberculosis strains when there was at least one mixed nucleotide position, and where both the mixtures components were present in similar isolates from other individuals. We determined risk factors for mixed infection among isolations of M. tuberculosis in England using logistic regression. We used survival analyses to assess the association between mixed infection and putative transmission.\\n\\nFindings6,560 isolations of TB were successfully sequenced in England 2016-2018. Of 3,691 (56%) specimens for which similar sequences had been isolated from at least two other individuals, 341 (9.2%) were mixed. Infection with lineages other than Lineage 4 were associated with mixed infection. Among the 1,823 individuals with pulmonary infection with Lineage 4 M. tuberculosis, mixed infection was associated with significantly increased risk of subsequent isolation of closely related organisms from a different individual (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.05,1.94), indicative of transmission.\\n\\nInterpretationMixtures of transmissible strains occur in at least 5% of tuberculosis infections in England; when present in pulmonary disease, such mixtures are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis transmission.\\n\\nFundingPublic Health England; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit Oxford; European Union.\\n\\nResearch in Context\\n\\nEvidence Before This StudyWe searched Pubmed using the search terms  tuberculosis and  mixed or  mixture for English Language articles published up to 1 April 2019. Studies, most performed without the benefit of genomic sequencing, report mixed TB infection from a range of medium and high prevalence areas and show it to be associated with delayed treatment response. Modelling suggests detection and treatment of mixed TB infection is an important goal for TB eradication campaigns. Although routine DNA sequencing of M. tuberculosis isolates is becoming widespread, efficient methods for detecting mixed infection from such data are underdeveloped, and the true prevalence of mixed infection and its association with transmission is unclear.\\n\\nAdded Value of This StudyThis study investigated a large series of TB isolations obtained as part of a routine Mycobacterial sequencing program by two reference laboratories, in a low incidence area, England. We developed an efficient generalisable approach to identify transmitted mixed M. tuberculosis infection; our approach is capable of sensitive and specific detection of a single mixed nucleotide position. We identified mixed infection of similar strains ( microvariation) in about 9.2% of the M. tuberculosis samples which we were able to assess, and found evidence of increased transmission from individuals with mixed infection.\\n\\nImplications of All the Available EvidenceTB microvariation is a risk factor for TB transmission, even in the low incidence area studied. Although an efficient and highly specific technique identifying microvariation exists, it relies on comparison with similar sequences isolated from other patients. Sharing of sequence data from the many TB sequencing programs being deployed globally will increase the sensitivity of microvariation detection, and may assist targeted public health interventions.",

Although such glucuronide conjugates are classically thought to be biologically inert, there is accumulating evidence that this may not always be the case. We investigated the activity of pCG, studying its interactions with the cerebral vasculature and the brain in vitro and in vivo.\n\nMethodsMale C57Bl/6J mice were used to assess blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and whole brain transcriptomic changes in response to pCG treatment. Effects were then further explored using the human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3, assessing paracellular permeability, transendothelial electrical resistance and barrier protein expression.\n\nResultsMice exposed to pCG showed reduced BBB permeability and significant changes in whole brain transcriptome expression. Surprisingly, treatment of hCMEC/D3 cells with pCG had no notable effects until co-administered with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, at which point it was able to prevent the permeabilising effects of endotoxin. Further analysis suggested that pCG acts as an antagonist at the principal lipopolysaccharide receptor TLR4.\n\nConclusionThe amino acid phase II metabolic product pCG is biologically active at the BBB, highlighting the complexity of gut microbe to host communication and the gut-brain axis.",

Purpose: in order to study the distribution patterns of wing sexual dimorphism, we analysed 57 species from 17 genera of 9 subfamilies. Methods: A comparative analysis of the evidence, obtained by geometric morphometry and molecular data, allowed us to assess the phylogenetic signal in the sexual dimorphism of the wing. Results: The results of the study confirm the presence of diverse patterns of sexual variability in the wings of this family. More often, females have larger wings with blunted apexes, whereas males are characterized by a more pointed apex. In some cases, the larger size of females wings is associated with an increase in body size, while in other cases, differences in shape and size can be explained by differences in behavioural and life patterns. Although there exists a general pattern of sexual dimorphism, its features differ even in closely related species. Conclusion: the absence of a significant phylogenetic signal in seven out of nine studied wing points indicates that the sexual dimorphism in form evolved, at least partially, in each of the studied species.",

Our molecular simulations at atomistic and coarse-grained scales show that both the microtubule severing protein spastin and the caseinolytic protease ClpY, accomplish spectacular unfolding of their diverse substrates, a microtubule lattice and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), by taking advantage of mechanical anisotropy in these proteins. By considering wild-type and variants of DHFR, we found that optimal ClpY-mediated action probes favorable orientations of the substrate relative to the machine. Unfolding of wild-type DHFR involves strong mechanical interfaces near each terminal and occurs along branched pathways, whereas unfolding of DHFR variants involves softer mechanical interfaces and occurs through single pathways, but translocation hindrance can arise from internal mechanical resistance. For spastin, optimum severing action initiated by pulling on a tubulin subunit is achieved through the orientation of the machine versus the substrate (microtubule lattice). Moreover, changes in the strength of the interactions between spastin and a microtubule filament, which can be driven by the tubulin code, lead to drastically different outcomes for the integrity of the hexameric structure of the machine.",

Although unprecedented efforts are underway to develop therapeutic strategies against this disease, scientists have acquired only a little knowledge regarding the structures and functions of the CoV replication and transcription complex (RTC) and 16 non-structural proteins, named NSP1-16.\n\nResultsIn the present study, we proposed a two-route model to answer how the RTC functions in the jumping transcription of CoVs. The key step leading to this model was that the motif AAACH for METTL3 recognition flanking the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif was discovered to determine the m6A methylation of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, by reanalyzing public Nanopore RNA-seq data. As the most important finding, TRS hairpins were reported for the first time to interpret NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation of CoVs and their association at the molecular level. In addition, we reported canonical TRS motifs of all CoVs to prove the importance of our findings.\n\nConclusionsThe main conclusions are: (1) TRS hairpins can be used to identify recombination regions in CoV genomes; (2) RNA methylation of CoVs participates in the determination of the RNA secondary structures by affecting the formation of base pairing; and (3) The eventual determination of the CoV RTC global structure needs to consider METTL3 in the experimental design. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, providing a crucial basis for future studies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Double strand break repair during meiosis is normally achieved using the homologous chromosome as a repair template. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes have reduced sequence homology with one another, presenting unique challenges to the repair of double strand breaks. Our understanding of how heteromorphic sex chromosomes behave during meiosis has been largely limited to the ancient sex chromosomes of mammals, where the X and Y differ markedly in overall structure and gene content. Consequently, pairing of the X and Y chromosomes is limited to a small pseudoautosomal region. It remains unclear how more recently evolved sex chromosomes, that share considerably more sequence homology with one another, pair and repair double strand breaks during meiosis. One possibility is barriers to pairing evolve rapidly. Alternatively, recently evolved sex chromosomes may exhibit pairing and double strand break repair that more closely resembles that of their autosomal ancestors. Here we use the recently evolved X and Y chromosomes of the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to study patterns of pairing and double stranded break formation using molecular cytogenetics. We found that the sex chromosomes of threespine stickleback fish do not pair exclusively in the pseudoautosomal region. Instead, the chromosomes fully pair in a non-homologous fashion. To achieve this, the X chromosome underwent synaptic adjustment during pachytene to match the axis length of the Y chromosome. Double strand break formation and repair rate also matched that of the autosomes. Our results highlight that recently evolved sex chromosomes exhibit meiotic behavior that is reminiscent of autosomes and argues for further work to identify the homologous templates that are used to repair double strand breaks on the X and Y chromosomes.",

Trichodesmium blooms typically comprise a complex assemblage of subpopulations and colony-morphologies that are predicted to exhibit distinct ecological lifestyles. Here, we assessed the poorly studied diversity of Trichodesmium in the Red Sea, based on metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and hetR gene-based phylotyping.\n\nWe assembled four non-redundant MAGs from morphologically distinct Trichodesmium colonies (tufts, dense and thin puffs). T. thiebautii (puffs) and T. erythraeum (tufts) were the dominant species within these morphotypes. While subspecies diversity is present for both T. thiebautii and T. erythraeum, a single T. thiebautii genotype comprised both thin and dense puff morphotypes, and we therefore hypothesize that the phenotypic variation between these morphologies is likely attributed to gene regulation. Additionally, we found the rare non-diazotrophic clade IV and V genotypes, related to T. nobis and T. miru respectively, that likely occurred as single filaments. HetR gene phylogeny indicates that the genotype in clade IV could represent the species T. contortum.\n\nWe further show that hetR phylotyping can overestimate the taxonomic diversity of Trichodesmium, as two copies of the hetR gene were present within T. thiebautii genomes, one of which misidentified this lineage as T. aureum. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of re-assessing Trichodesmium taxonomy while showing the ability of genomics to capture the complex diversity and distribution of Trichodesmium populations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Parkinsons disease is mainly caused by aggregation of -synuclein (-syn) in the brain. Exchange of -syn between the brain and peripheral tissues could have important pathophysiological and therapeutic implications, but the trafficking mechanism of -syn across the blood brain barrier (BBB) remains unclear. In this study, we therefore investigated uptake and transport mechanisms of -syn monomers and oligomers across an in vitro BBB model system. Both -syn monomers and oligomers were internalized by primary brain endothelial cells, with increased restriction of oligomeric over monomeric transport. To enlighten the trafficking route of monomeric -syn in brain endothelial cells, we investigated co-localization of -syn and intracellular markers of vesicular transport. Here, we observed the highest colocalization with clathrin, Rab7 and VPS35, suggesting a clathrin-dependent internalization, preferentially followed by a late endosome retromer-connected trafficking pathway. Furthermore, STED microscopy revealed monomeric -syn trafficking via Rab7-decorated carriers. Knockdown of Caveolin1, VPS35, and Rab7 using siRNA did not affect monomeric -syn uptake into endothelial cells. However, it significantly reduced transcytosis of monomeric -syn in the luminal-abluminal direction, suggesting a polarized regulation of monomeric -syn vesicular transport. Our findings suggest a direct role for Rab7 in polarized trafficking of monomeric -syn across BBB endothelium, and the potential of Rab7 directed trafficking to constitute a target pathway for new therapeutic strategies against Parkinsons disease and related synucleinopathies.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the submitted manuscript, we describe the use of a state-of-the-art porcine blood-brain barrier model based on primary cells to get information about this important issue. We identify several hitherto undescribed cellular pathways to mediate polarized transport of alpha-synuclein. One of these paths we find regulated by Rab7 and can be inhibited by targeting several intracellular proteins such as VPS35, Caveolin1 and Rab7. New knowledge describing brain endothelial intracellular transport systems are highly warranted for identifying new target to alleviate Parkinsons disease. We believe that our findings could be the seed to establish new therapeutic strategies against Parkinsons disease and related synucleinopathies.",

Emerging evidence suggests that circadian decline feeds-forward to neurodegenerative symptoms, exacerbating them, highlighting a need for restoring circadian health. Therefore, we asked whether any of the known neurotoxic modifiers can suppress circadian dysfunction. We performed a screen of neurotoxicity-modifier genes to suppress circadian behavioural arrhythmicity in a Drosophila circadian HD model. Notably, the molecular chaperones HSP40 and HSP70 (Heat Shock Protein) emerged as significant suppressors in the circadian context, with HSP40 being the more potent mitigator of HD-induced deficits. Upon HSP40 overexpression in the Drosophila circadian ventrolateral neurons (LNv), the behavioural rhythm rescue was associated with neuronal rescue of loss in circadian proteins from small LNv soma. Specifically, there was a restoration of the molecular clock protein Period and its oscillations in young flies and a long-lasting rescue of the output neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor. Significantly, there was a reduction in the expanded Huntingtin inclusion load, concomitant with the appearance of a spot-like Huntingtin form. Thus, we provide evidence for the first time that implicates the neuroprotective chaperone HSP40 in circadian rehabilitation. Given the importance of proteostasis and circadian health in neurodegenerative diseases, the involvement of molecular chaperones in circadian maintenance has broader therapeutic implications.\n\nSummary StatementThis study shows, for the first time, a neuroprotective role of chaperone HSP40 in overcoming circadian dysfunction associated with Huntingtons Disease in a Drosophila model",

Natural environments also vary in nutrient availability, resulting in distinct physiological changes in bacteria which may have direct implications on their capacity to repair their chromosomes. Here, we evaluated the impact of varying the nutrient availability on the expression of the SOS response induced by chronic sub-lethal DNA damage in E. coli. The expression of the SOS regulon was found to be highly heterogeneous at the single-cell level in all growth conditions. Surprisingly, we observed a larger fraction of high SOS-induced cells in slow growth as compared with fast growth, despite a higher rate of SOS induction in fast growth. This counter-intuitive result can be explained by the dynamic balance between the rate of SOS induction and the division rates of cells exposed to DNA damage. Taken together, our data illustrates how cell division and physiology come together to produce growth-dependent heterogeneity in the DNA damage response.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Temperature plays an important role in determining breeding phenology of temperate birds, with higher spring temperatures associated with earlier breeding. However, the effect of localised territory-scale temperature variations is poorly understood, with relationships between temperature and breeding phenology mostly studied using coarse-grained climatic indices. Here, we interpolate spring temperatures recorded at 150 m2 grid intersections encompassing 417 ha of forest to examine the influence of territory-scale temperature, and its interaction with mean annual temperature, on territory selection, breeding phenology, clutch size and fledgling success for three co-occurring single-brooded passerine birds using data from 672 nests over four years. All species exhibited significant trends in reproductive traits associated with territory-scale temperature. Pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca settled in cooler territories first, where they raised more fledglings. Blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus laid larger clutches in warmer territories in warm years and always laid earlier at warmer territories irrespective of annual temperature variation. Contrastingly, pied flycatcher and wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix breeding phenology was earlier at warmer territories in cool years and cooler territories in warm years, with wood warbler clutch size responding similarly to this interaction. Greater previous breeding experience and increased higher rates of historical territory occupancy (territory quality) also predicted earlier breeding phenology and higher fledging success for pied flycatchers. We suggest that the migratory pied flycatcher and wood warbler are best synchronised with their prey availability in cooler years at a local population level while resident blue tits match local phenology across all years, which is potentially advantageous under warmer predicted climate change scenarios. We conclude that temperature at the territory scale can be an important driver of settlement and breeding phenology and influence reproductive traits.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Range expansion is the spatial spread of a population into previously unoccupied regions. Understanding range expansion is important for the study and successful manipulation and management of ecosystems, with applications ranging from controlling bacterial biofilm formation in industrial and medical environments to large scale conservation programmes for species undergoing climate-change induced habitat disruption. During range expansion, species typically encounter competitors. Moreover, the environment into which expansion takes place is almost always heterogeneous when considered at the scale of the individual. Despite the ubiquitous nature of these features, the impact of competition and spatial landscape heterogeneities on range expansion remains understudied. In this paper we present a theoretical framework comprising two competing generic species undergoing range expansion and use it to investigate the impact of spatial landscape heterogeneities on range expansion with a particular focus on its effect on competition dynamics. We reveal that the area covered by range expansion during a fixed time interval is highly variable due to the fixed landscape heterogeneities. Moreover, we report significant variability in competitive outcome (relative abundance of a focal species) but determine that this is induced by low initial population densities, independent of landscape heterogeneities. We further show that both area covered by range expansion and competitive outcome can be accurately predicted by a Voronoi tessellation with respect to an appropriate metric, which only requires information on the spatial landscape and the response of each species to that landscape. Finally, we reveal that if species interact antagonistically during range expansion, the dominant mode of competition depends on the initial population density. Antagonistic actions determine competitive outcome if the initial population density is high, but competition for space is the dominant mode of competition if the initial population density is low.",

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a versatile, time-effective tool that provides information on post-translational modifications, ligand interactions, conformational changes, and higher-order oligomerization. Using three protein systems, we show that native MS experiments can uncover structural features of ligand interactions, homology models, and point mutations, that are undetectable by AF2 alone.

This interaction is blocked through competitive inhibition by soluble ACE2 protein. Therefore, developing high-affinity and cost-effective ACE2 peptidomimetic ligands that disrupt this protein-protein interaction is a promising strategy for viral diagnostics and therapy. We employed human and plant defensins, a class of small and highly stable proteins, and engineered the amino acid residues on its conformationally constrained alpha-helices to mimic the critical residues on the ACE2 helix 1 that interacts with the Spike-protein. The engineered proteins were soluble and purified to homogeneity with high yield from a bacterial expression system. The proteins demonstrated exceptional thermostability, high-affinity binding to the Spike protein with dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range, and were used in a diagnostic assay that detected SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. This work addresses the challenge of developing helical peptidomimetics by demonstrating that defensins provide promising scaffolds to engineer alpha-helices in a constrained form for designing high-affinity ligands.\n\nBroad audience statementThe engineered proteins developed in this study are cost-effective and highly stable reagents for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

    "preprint_abstract": "AlphaFold2 has revolutionized protein structure prediction by leveraging sequence information to rapidly model protein folds with atomic-level accuracy. Nevertheless, previous work has shown that these predictions tend to be inaccurate for structurally heterogeneous proteins. To systematically assess factors that contribute to this inaccuracy, we tested AlphaFold2s performance on 98 fold-switching proteins, which assume at least two distinct-yet-stable secondary and tertiary structures. Topological similarities were quantified between five predicted and two experimentally determined structures of each fold-switching protein. Overall, 94% of AlphaFold2 predictions captured one experimentally determined conformation but not the other. Despite these biased results, AlphaFold2s estimated confidences were moderate-to-high for 74% of fold-switching residues, a result that contrasts with overall low confidences for intrinsically disordered proteins, which are also structurally heterogeneous. To investigate factors contributing to this disparity, we quantified sequence variation within the multiple sequence alignments used to generate AlphaFold2s predictions of fold-switching and intrinsically disordered proteins. Unlike intrinsically disordered regions, whose sequence alignments show low conservation, fold-switching regions had conservation rates statistically similar to canonical single-fold proteins. Furthermore, intrinsically disordered regions had systematically lower prediction confidences than either fold-switching or single-fold proteins, regardless of sequence conservation. AlphaFold2s high prediction confidences for one fold-switching conformation corroborate previous work showing that machine-learning-based structure predictors fail to capture other fundamental biophysical features of proteins such as their folding pathways. Our results emphasize the need to look at protein structure as an ensemble and suggest that systematic examination of fold-switching sequences may reveal propensities for multiple stable secondary and tertiary structures.",

From this work we identified the compound 7-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-6,7-dihydro-3H-imidazo[4,5-b] pyridin-5-ol (6) as a novel inhibitor scaffold. This compound inhibited several types of cancer cell proliferation at low micromolar concentrations with low toxicity. Compound 6 caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and blocked tubulin polymerization at low micromolar concentration (IC50 = 6.1 {+/-}0.1 M), inducing apoptosis via activation of caspase 9, increasing the level of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreasing the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2.

Unlike pigmentary colours and patterns, little is known about the genetic basis of these colours. Reflective structures on wing-scale ridges are responsible for iridescent structural colour in many butterflies, including the Mullerian mimics Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. Here we quantify aspects of scale ultrastructure variation and colour in crosses between iridescent and non-iridescent subspecies of both of these species and perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We show that iridescent structural colour has a complex genetic basis in both species, with offspring from crosses having wide variation in blue colour (both hue and brightness) and scale structure measurements. We detect two different genomic regions in each species that explain modest amounts of this variation, with a sex-linked QTL in H. erato but not H. melpomene. We also find differences between species in the relationships between structure and colour, overall suggesting that these species have followed different evolutionary trajectories in their evolution of structural colour. We then identify genes within the QTL intervals that are differentially expressed between subspecies and/or wing regions, revealing likely candidates for genes controlling structural colour formation.",

Ligaments, a matrix-rich connective tissue, play an important mechanical function that stabilises the knee joint and yet their role in OA is not well studied. Recent studies have shown that ligament extracellular matrix (ECM) structure is compromised in the early stages of OA, but it remains unclear how this affects ligament function and biomechanics. In this study, the aim was to investigate the structural, cellular and viscoelastic changes in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a murine non-invasive post-traumatic OA (PTOA) model. Non-invasive mechanical loading of the knee joint of C57BL/6J mice (10-week-old) was used as a PTOA model. Knee joints were analysed for joint space mineralisation and the ACLs were assessed with histology and mechanical testing. PTOA knee joints had a 33-46% increase in joint space mineralisation and PTOA knee joint ACLs exhibited ECM modifications, including collagen birefringence and COL2 and proteoglycan deposition. ECM changes were associated with cells expressing chondrogenic markers (SOX9 and RUNX2) expanding from the tibial enthesis to the ACL midbody. Viscoelastic and mechanical changes in the ACLs from PTOA knee joints included a 20-21% decrease in tangent modulus at 2MPa of stress, and a decrease strain rate sensitivity at higher strain rates and a significant increase in relaxation during stress-relaxation, but no changes to hysteresis and ultimate load to failure. These results demonstrate that ACL pathology and viscoelastic function is compromised in murine PTOA knee joints and provides further evidence of the important role of ligaments in the knee joint organ in health and disease.",

Here we investigate how the brain makes the most basic prediction about the physical world: whether the situation in front of us is stable, and hence likely to stay the same, or unstable, and hence likely to change in the immediate future. Specifically, we ask if judgements of stability can be supported by the kinds of representations that have proven to be highly effective at visual object recognition in both machines and brains, or instead if the ability to determine the physical stability of natural scenes may require generative algorithms that simulate the physics of the world. To find out, we measured responses in both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the brain (using fMRI) to natural images of physically stable versus unstable scenarios. We find no evidence for generalizable representations of physical stability in either standard CNNs trained on visual object and scene classification (ImageNet), or in the human ventral visual pathway, which has long been implicated in the same process. However, in fronto-parietal regions previously implicated in intuitive physical reasoning we find both scenario-invariant representations of physical stability, and higher univariate responses to unstable than stable scenes. These results demonstrate abstract representations of physical stability in the dorsal but not ventral pathway, consistent with the hypothesis that the computations underlying stability entail not just pattern classification but forward physical simulation.",

However, they are not in widespread use in academic settings, where funding, space and maintenance specialists are usually limiting. In addition, current robots require lengthy programming by specialists and are incompatible with most academic laboratories with constantly changing small-scale projects. Here, we present the Pipetting Helper Imaging Lid (PHIL), an inexpensive, small, open-source personal liquid handling robot. It is designed for inexperienced users, with self-production from cheap commercial and 3D-printable components and custom control software. PHIL successfully automated pipetting for e.g. tissue immunostainings and stimulations of live stem and progenitor cells during time-lapse microscopy. PHIL is cheap enough for any laboratory member to have their own personal pipetting robot(s), and enables users without programming skills to easily automate a large range of experiments.",

We quantified base-specific RNA editing across three major cell populations from the human prefrontal cortex: glutamatergic neurons, medial ganglionic eminence GABAergic neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We found more selective editing and RNA hyper-editing in neurons relative to oligodendrocytes. The pattern of RNA editing was highly cell type-specific, with 189,229 cell type-associated sites. The cellular specificity for thousands of sites was confirmed by single nucleus RNA-sequencing. Importantly, cell type-associated sites were enriched in GTEx RNA-sequencing data, edited [~]twentyfold higher than all other sites, and variation in RNA editing was predominantly explained by neuronal proportions in bulk brain tissue. Finally, we discovered 661,791 cis-editing quantitative trait loci across thirteen brain regions, including hundreds with cell type-associated features. These data reveal an expansive repertoire of highly regulated RNA editing sites across human brain cell types and provide a resolved atlas linking cell types to editing variation and genetic regulatory effects.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Dysregulation of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription program, which synthesizes tRNA and other classes of small noncoding RNA critical for cell growth and proliferation, is associated with cancer and human disease. Previous studies have identified two distinct Pol III isoforms defined by the incorporation of either subunit POLR3G (RPC7) during early development, or POLR3GL (RPC7{beta}) in specialized tissues. Though POLR3G is re-established in cancer and immortalized cell lines, the contributions of these isoforms to transcription potential and transcription dysregulation in cancer remain poorly defined. Using an integrated Pol III genomic profiling approach in combination with in vitro differentiation and subunit disruption experiments, we discover that loss of subunit POLR3G is accompanied by a restricted repertoire of genes transcribed by Pol III. In particular, we observe that a specific class of small noncoding RNA, SNAR-A, is exquisitely sensitive to the availability of subunit POLR3G in proliferating cells. Taken further, large-scale analysis of Pol III subunit expression and downstream chromatin features identifies concomitant loss of POLR3G and SNAR-A activity across a multitude of differentiated primary immune cell lineages, and conversely, coordinate re-establishment of POLR3G expression and SNAR-A features in a variety of human cancers. These results altogether argue against strict redundancy models for subunits POLR3G and POLR3GL, and instead support a model in which Pol III identity itself functions as an important transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Upregulation of POLR3G, which is driven by MYC, identifies a subgroup of patients with unfavorable survival outcomes in specific cancers, further implicating the POLR3G-enhanced transcription repertoire as a potential disease factor.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Sexual systems are highly diverse and have profound consequences for population dynamics and resilience. Yet, little is known about how they evolved. Using phylogenetic Bayesian modelling and a sample of 4614 species, we show that gonochorism is the likely ancestral condition in teleost fish. While all hermaphroditic forms revert quickly to gonochorism, protogyny and simultaneous hermaphroditism are evolutionarily more stable than protandry. In line with theoretical expectations, simultaneous hermaphroditism does not evolve directly from gonochorism but can evolve slowly from sequential hermaphroditism, particularly protandry. We find support for the predictions from life history theory that protogynous, but not protandrous, species live longer than gonochoristic species and invest the least in male gonad mass. The distribution of teleosts sexual systems on the tree of life does not seem to reflect just adaptive predictions, suggesting that adaptations alone may not fully explain why some sexual forms evolve in some taxa but not others (Williams paradox). We propose that future studies should incorporate mating systems, spawning behaviours, and the diversity of sex determining mechanisms. Some of the latter might constrain the evolution of hermaphroditism, while the non-duality of the embryological origin of teleost gonads might explain why protogyny predominates over protandry in teleosts.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Humans display great versatility when performing goal-directed tasks while walking. However, the extent to which such versatility helps with fall avoidance remains unclear. We recently demonstrated a functional connection between the motor regulation needed to achieve task goals (e.g. maintaining walking speed) and a simple walkers ability to reject large disturbances. Here, for the same model, we identify the viability kernel--the state space region in which the walker can step forever via at least one sequence of push-off inputs per state. We further find that only a few basins of attraction of the speed-regulated walkers steady-state gaits can fully cover the viability kernel. This highlights a potentially important role of task-level motor regulation in fall avoidance. Therefore, we posit an adaptive hierarchical control/regulation strategy that switches between different task-level regulators to avoid falls. Our hierarchical task switching controller only requires a target value of the regulated observable--a  task switch--at each walking step, each chosen from a small, predetermined collection. Because humans have typically already learned to perform such tasks during nominal walking conditions, this suggests that the  information cost of biologically implementing such controllers for the nervous system, including cognitive demands in humans, could be relatively low.",

NFAT5 activity is tightly regulated by extracellular tonicity but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We demonstrated that NFAT5 enters the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. We also found that NFAT5 utilizes a non-canonical nuclear localization signal (NFAT5-NLS) for nuclear imports. siRNA screening revealed that karyopherin {beta}1 (KPNB1) drives nuclear import of NFAT5 via directly interacting with NFAT5-NLS. Proteomics analysis and siRNA screening further revealed that nuclear export of NFAT5 under hypotonicity is mediated by Exportin-T, and that it requires RuvB-Like AAA type ATPase 2 (RUVBL2) as an indispensable chaperone. Our findings have identified KPNB1 and RUVBL2 as key molecules responsible for the unconventional tonicity-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NFAT5. These findings offer an opportunity for developing novel NFAT5 targeting strategies that are potentially useful for the treatment of diseases associated with NFAT5 dysregulation.",

Enhancers controlled gene expression frequency, as predicted by the binary model of enhancer action, and enhancer deletion converted the broadly expressed Nkg2d into an RME gene, recapitulating natural variegation. The results suggested that RME is a consequence of general enhancer properties and therefore many genes may be subject to some degree of RME, which was borne out by analysis of a panel of genes previously thought to be universally expressed within defined hematopoietic lineages: Nkg2d, Cd45, Cd8a and Thy1. We propose that previously documented RME is an extreme on a continuum of intrinsically probabilistic gene expression.",

The mechanistic origin of the temporal organization and its contribution to cognition remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the cause of this organization by studying a specific temporal signature (autocorrelogram time constant and latency) of neural activity. In monkey frontal areas, recorded during flexible cognitive decisions, temporal signatures display highly specific area-dependent ranges, as well as anatomical and cell-type distributions. Moreover, temporal signatures are functionally adapted to behaviorally relevant timescales. Fine-grained biophysical network models, constrained to account for temporal signatures, reveal that after-hyperpolarization potassium and inhibitory GABA-B conductances critically determine areas specificity. They mechanistically account for temporal signatures by organizing activity into metastable states, with inhibition controlling state stability and transitions. As predicted by models, state durations non-linearly scale with temporal signatures in monkey, matching behavioral timescales. Thus, local inhibitory-controlled metastability constitutes the dynamical core specifying the temporal organization of cognitive functions in frontal areas.",

It is, therefore beneficial for cells to tightly regulate CypD and MPTP but little is known about such regulation. We have reported before that CypD is downregulated and MPTP deactivated during differentiation in various tissues. Herein, we identify BMP/Smad signaling, a major driver of differentiation, as a transcriptional repressor of the CypD gene, Ppif. Using osteogenic induction of mesenchymal lineage cells as a model of BMP/Smad-dependent differentiation, we show that CypD is in fact transcriptionally repressed during this process. The importance of such CypD downregulation is evidenced by the negative effect of CypD  rescue via gain-of-function on osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In sum, we characterized BMP/Smad signaling as a regulator of CypD expression and elucidated the role of CypD downregulation during cell differentiation.",

Therefore, understanding the genetic regulation of gene expression during T cell activation provides essential insights into how genetic variants influence the response to infections and immune diseases. We generated a single-cell map of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) across a T cell activation time-course. We profiled 655,349 CD4+ naive and memory T cells, capturing transcriptional states of unstimulated cells and three time points of cell activation in 119 healthy individuals. We identified 38 cell clusters, including stable clusters such as central and effector memory T cells and transient clusters that were only present at individual time points of activation, such as interferon-responding cells. We mapped eQTLs using a T cell activation trajectory and identified 6,407 eQTL genes, of which a third (2,265 genes) were dynamically regulated during T cell activation. We integrated this information with GWAS variants for immune-mediated diseases and observed 127 colocalizations, with significant enrichment in dynamic eQTLs. Immune disease loci colocalized with genes that are involved in the regulation of T cell activation, and genes with similar functions tended to be perturbed in the same direction by disease risk alleles. Our results emphasize the importance of mapping context-specific gene expression regulation, provide insights into the mechanisms of genetic susceptibility of immune diseases, and help prioritize new therapeutic targets.",

Characterization and chromosomal distribution of retrotransposons could enhance the comprehension of the role and dynamics of the repetitive elements in plants. In this study, a phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the conserved reverse transcriptase sequences and revealed that these Ty1-copia retrotransposons had typical structure. Analysis showed that total Ty1-copia retrotransposons had a significant component, as high as 5.12 x 103 copy numbers in P. purpureum. Then, the chromosomal pattern of four known lineages were also analyzed with Pennisetum glaucum genome, which suggested that the Sire/Maximus lineage had the highest copy number and followed by Tork/Angela, Tork/TAR, Retrofit/Ale. Additionally, the chromosomal distribution of total Ty1-copia retrotransposons was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to be a dispersed pattern with weak clustering, mostly near the centromeric regions of P. purpureum chromosomes; interestingly, there were four obvious signals in the subterminal chromosomes. These results suggested that there occurred differential dynamic evolution directions of Ty1-copia retrotransposons within P. purpureum. Furthermore, co-localization of Ty1-copia, 5S rDNA, and 35S rDNA indicated that two chromosome 2 and four chromosome 4 were identified. Concurrently, subterminal signals of Ty1-copia-type retrotransposons were located on four other homologous chromosomes. Altogether, these results shed light on the diversification of Ty1-copia retrotransposons and have the significance for generation of valid chromosomal markers in retrotransposon families.",

Here we identified a RAS-phenotype that can be targeted by the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) romidepsin. We showed that the hyperacetylation induced by romidepsin depleted acetyl-CoA, the cell donor substrate for acetylation, and led to metabolic stress and death in KRAS-activated cells. Elastic net analysis on transcriptomics from a 608-cell panel confirmed that HDACi sensitivity was linked to a difference in profiles in two pathways involved in acetyl-CoA metabolism. The analysis of a clinical dataset confirmed that perturbation of the two acetyl-CoA pathways were correlated with HDACi sensitivity in patients treated with belinostat. Our analysis suggests the potential utility of a RAS-associated acetyl-CoA phenotype to sharpen treatment choices for RAS-activated tumors.",

While DNMT3A is known to impact feeding behavior via the hypothalamus, here we investigated a role in adipocyte progenitors utilizing heterozygous knockout mice that recapitulate cardinal TBRS phenotypes. These mice become morbidly obese due to adipocyte enlargement and tissue expansion. Adipose tissue in these mice exhibited defects in preadipocyte maturation and precocious activation of inflammatory gene networks, including interleukin-6 signaling. Adipocyte progenitor cell lines lacking DNMT3A exhibited aberrant differentiation. Furthermore, mice in which Dnmt3a was specifically ablated in adipocyte progenitors showed enlarged fat depots and increased progenitor numbers, partly recapitulating the TBRS obesity phenotypes. Loss of DNMT3A led to constitutive DNA hypomethylation, such that the DNA methylation landscape of young adipocyte progenitors resemble that of older wild-type mice.

We examine the alternative hypothesis that stimuli are encoded with noise, then optimally decoded. Under a model of efficient coding, the amount of noise should vary across stimuli, and depend on statistics of the stimuli. We investigate these predictions through a task in which participants are asked to compare the averages of two series of numbers, each sampled from a prior distribution that varies across blocks of trials. Subjects encode numbers with a bias and a noise that both depend on the number. Infrequently occurring numbers are encoded with more noise. We show how an efficient-coding, Bayesian-decoding model accounts for these patterns, and best captures subjects behaviour. Finally, our results suggest that Wei and Stockers \"law of human perception\", which relates the bias and variability of sensory estimates, also applies to number cognition.",

Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) prevents ferroptosis by converting phospholipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols4, 5. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathology of several degenerative conditions and inhibiting GPX4 activity has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to induce cancer cell death1, 2. However, many cancer cell lines are resistant to GPX4 inhibition6, and the mechanisms that regulate GPX4 activity and ferroptosis resistance remain incompletely understood. Here, employing a synthetic lethal CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor. LRP8 is upregulated in cancer, and we find that it promotes ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells in both 2-dimensional (2-D) cell culture and 3-dimensional (3-D) spheroid models. Mechanistically, loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels, resulting in the reduced expression of a subset of selenoproteins, including GPX4. Remarkably, the reduction in GPX4 is not due to the classic hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program7, 8. Instead, our findings demonstrate that the translation of GPX4 is severely impaired in the selenium-deficient LRP8 knockout (KO) cells due to extensive ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine (SEC) UGA codon, which results in ribosome collisions and early translation termination. Thus, our findings reveal ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as targetable ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer cells.",

Continuous rotation data were collected using an ultra-low exposure rate on a Falcon 4 direct electron detector in electron-counting mode. For the first sample, triclinic lysozyme extending to 0.87 [A] resolution, an ideal helical fragment of only three alanine residues provided initial phases. These phases were improved using density modification, allowing the entire atomic structure to be built automatically. A similar approach was successful on a second macromolecular sample, proteinase K, which is much larger and diffracted to a modest 1.5 [A] resolution. These results demonstrate that macromolecules can be determined to sub-[A]ngstrom resolution by MicroED and that ab initio phasing can be successfully applied to counting data collected on a direct electron detector.",

We used the ML method to improve the selection of biologically active compounds for Alzheimers disease (AD) from high-content high-throughput screening (HCS). The ML method identified novel compounds that effectively blocked tau aggregation, which would have been missed by traditional screening approaches unguided by ML. The method improved triaging efficiency of compound rankings over conventional rankings by raw image channels. We reproduced this ML pipeline on a biologically independent cancer-based dataset, demonstrating its generalizability.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundCodon usage bias (CUB), the non-uniform usage of synonymous codons, occurs across all domains of life. Adaptive CUB is hypothesized to result from selection for efficient ribosome elongation, accurate translation, mRNA secondary structure, and/or protein folding. Given the critical link between protein folding and protein function, numerous studies have analyzed the relationship between codon usage and protein structure. The results from these studies have often been contradictory, likely reflecting the differing methods used for measuring codon usage and the failure to appropriately control for confounding factors, such as differences in amino acid usage between protein structures and changes in the frequency of different structures with gene expression.\n\nResultsHere we take an explicit population genetics approach to quantify codon-specific shifts in natural selection related to protein structure. As a result, our approach avoids the problem of needing to choose a specific metric of codon usage, naturally takes amino acid usage of a region into account, and explicitly takes variation in gene expression into account. Our results reveal a weak relationship between codon usage and protein structure, indicating that differences in selection between structures are subtle and/or intermittent. While the magnitude of differences in selection are slight, our results indicate the relationship between codon usage and protein structure is more complex than previously believed.\n\nConclusionsWhile our results clearly indicate that selection on codon usage shifts between secondary structure, the overall impact of these shifts on codon usage are small. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates the statistical power and benefits of studying selective shifts on codon usage or other genomic features from an explicitly evolutionary approach. Limitations of this approach are discussed.",

Entry into proliferative cycles is driven by Cyclin/Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Conserved Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), p21Cip1/Waf1, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2, bind to Cyclin/Cdks and inhibit Cdk activity. p27 tyrosine phosphorylation, in response to mitogenic signalling, promotes activation of CyclinD/Cdk4 and CyclinA/Cdk2. Tyrosine phosphorylation is conserved in p21 and p57, although the number of sites differs. We use molecular dynamics simulations to compare the structural changes in Cyclin/Cdk/CKI trimers induced by single and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation in CKIs and their impact on CyclinD/Cdk4 and CyclinA/Cdk2 activity. Despite shared structural features, CKI binding induces distinct structural responses in Cyclin/Cdks and the predicted effects of CKI tyrosine phosphorylation on Cdk activity are not conserved across CKIs. Our analyses suggest how CKIs may have evolved to be sensitive to different inputs to give context-dependent control of Cdk activity.",

In a preregistered double-blind, between-subject, placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI design, the present proof-of-concept study examined the potential of a single dose of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan (LT) to attenuate the mnemonic advantage of threatening stimuli and the underlying neural mechanism via combining an emotional subsequent memory paradigm with LT (n=29) or placebo treatment (n=30) and a surprise memory test after 24h washout. LT generally improved memory performance and abolished emotional memory enhancement for negative yet not positive material while emotional experience during encoding remained intact. LT further suppressed hippocampus activity during encoding of subsequently remembered negative stimuli. On the network level LT reduced coupling between hippocampus and basolateral amygdala during successful memory formation of negative stimuli. Our findings suggest that LT may have the potential to attenuate memory formation for negative yet not positive information by decreasing hippocampus activity and its functional coupling strength with amygdala. These findings suggest a promising potential of LT to prevent preferential encoding and remembering of negative events, a mechanism that could prevent the emotion-memory dysregulations underlying the development of PTSD-symptomatology.",

The genome editing procedure in hiPSCs is still inefficient, particularly when it comes to homology directed repair (HDR) of genetic mutations or targeted transgene insertion in the genome and single cell cloning of edited cells. In addition, genome editing processes also involve additional cellular stresses such as trouble with cell viability and genetic stability of hiPSCs. Therefore, efficient workflows are desired to increase genome editing application to hiPSC disease models and therapeutic applications. Apart from genome editing efficiency, hiPSC survival following single-cell cloning has proved to be challenging and has thus restricted the capability to easily isolate homogeneous clones from edited hiPSCs. To this end, we demonstrate an efficient workflow for feeder-free single cell clone generation and expansion in both CRISPR-mediated knock-out (KO) and knock-in (KI) hiPSC lines. Using StemFlex medium and CloneR supplement in conjunction with Matrigel cell culture matrix, we show that cell viability and expansion during single-cell cloning in edited and unedited cells is significantly enhanced. Our reliable single-cell cloning and expansion workflow did not affect the biology of the hiPSCs as the cells retained their growth and morphology, expression of various pluripotency markers and normal karyotype. This simplified and efficient workflow will allow for a new level of sophistication in generating hiPSC-based disease models to promote rapid advancement in basic research and also the development of novel cellular therapeutics.",

The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to down regulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1 phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3 supplemental regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression.",

We assessed cerebral laterality using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD), a non-invasive, perfusion-sensitive neuroimaging technique in 23 left- and 31 right-handed participants. Findings suggest that the linguistic aspect of written word generation recruited more left-hemispheric areas during writing, in right-handers compared to left-handers. This difference could be explained by greater variability in cerebral laterality patterns within left-handers or the possibility that the areas subserving language in left-handers are broader than in right-handers. Another explanation is that the attentional demands of the more novel symbol copying task (compared to writing) contributed more right-hemispheric activation in right-handers, but this could not be captured in left-handers due to ceiling effects. Future work could investigate such attentional demands using both simple and complex stimuli in the copying condition.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Improving the capacity of plants to face adverse environmental conditions requires a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing stress response and adaptation. Proteomics, combined with metabolic analyses, offers a wide resource of information to be used in plant breeding programs. Previous studies have shown that somatic embryogenesis in Pinus spp. is a suitable tool not only to investigate stress response processes but also to modulate the behaviour of somatic plants. Based on this, the objective of this study was to analyse the protein and soluble sugar profiles of Pinus radiata embryonal masses after the application of high temperatures to unravel the mechanisms involved in thermopriming and memory acquisition at early stages of the somatic embryogenesis process. Results confirmed that heat provokes deep readjustments in the life-cycle of proteins, together with a significant reduction in the carbon-flux of central-metabolism pathways. Heat-priming also promotes the accumulation of proteins involved in oxidative stress defence, in the synthesis of specific amino acids such as isoleucine, influences cell division, the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell-walls, and modifies the levels of free soluble sugars like glucose or fructose. All this seems to be regulated by proteins linked with epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.",

We examined the relative effect of migration, genetic drift, natural selection and human activities on the genetic repertoire of Agave angustifolia var. pacifica, an agave used for bacanora (an alcoholic spirit similar to tequila) production in northwestern Mexico. We sampled 34 wild and cultivated sites and used over eleven thousand genome-wide SNPs. We found shallow genetic structure among wild samples, although, detected differentiation between coastal and inland sites. Surprisingly, no differentiation was found between cultivated and wild populations. Moreover, we detected moderate inbreeding (FIS [~] 0.13) and similar levels of genomic diversity in wild and cultivated agaves. Nevertheless, the cultivated plants had almost no private alleles and presented evidence of clonality. The overall low genetic structure in A. angustifolia var. pacifica is apparently the result of high dispersibility promoted by pollinators and possibility of clonal reproduction. Incipient cultivation history and reliance on wild seeds and plants are probably responsible for the observed patterns of high genetic connectivity and considerable diversity in cultivated samples.",

Five repeatability animal models were exploited, considering the effects of farrowing season (model 1), farrowing month (model 2), quadratic regressions of daily maximum ambient temperature of farrowing day (model 3), season and temperature (model 4), or month and temperature (model 5). Patterns of the effects of daily maximum temperature of farrowing day estimated using model 3 was similar to those of farrowing season by model 1 and those of farrowing month by model 2. Adding the effect of daily maximum temperature of farrowing day (models 4 and 5) could explain phenotypic variability greater than only considering either of farrowing season and month (models 1 and 2). Estimated heritability was stable among the models and the rank correlation of predicted breeding values between models was >0.98 for all traits. The results indicate the possibility that using public ambient temperature can capture a large part of the phenotypic variability in litter size traits at birth caused by the seasonality in Japan and do not harm, at least, the performance of genetic evaluation. This study could support the availability of public meteorological data in flexible developing operational models for future swine genetic evaluation in Japan.",

FOP is caused by dominant gain-of-function mutations in the receptor ACVR1 (also known as ALK2), which render the receptor inappropriately responsive to activin ligands. In previous studies, we developed a genetic mouse model of FOP that recapitulates most clinical aspects of the disease. In this model, genetic loss of the wild-type Acvr1 allele profoundly exacerbated heterotopic ossification, suggesting the hypothesis that the stoichiometry of wild-type and mutant receptors dictates disease severity. Here, we tested this model by producing FOP mice that conditionally over-express human wild-type ACVR1. Injury-induced heterotopic ossification (HO) was completely blocked in FOP mice when expression of both the mutant and wild-type receptor were targeted to Tie2-positive cells, which includes fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Perinatal lethality of Acvr1R206H/+ mice was rescued by constitutive ACVR1 over-expression and these mice survived to adulthood at predicted Mendelian frequencies. Constitutive over-expression of ACVR1 also provided protection from spontaneous HO, and the incidence and severity of injury-induced HO in these mice was dramatically reduced. Analysis of pSMAD1/5/8 signaling both in cultured cells and in vivo indicates that ACVR1 over-expression functions cell-autonomously by reducing osteogenic signaling in response to activin A. Manipulating the stoichiometry of FOP-causing and wild-type ACVR1 receptors may provide the foundation for novel therapeutic strategies to treat this devastating disease.",

Although previous descriptions of histopathological changes are available, the lesions reported in these are not pathognomonic. Here, we report Cowdry type A inclusion bodies (CAIB) in the pancreas as a diagnostic histopathological feature found in adult Nile tilapia naturally infected with TiPV. This type of inclusion body has been well-known as a histopathological landmark for the diagnosis of other parvoviral infections in shrimp and terrestrial species. Interestingly, this lesion could be exclusively observed in pancreatic acinar cells, both in the hepatopancreas and pancreatic tissue along the intestine. In situ hybridization (ISH) using a TiPV-specific probe revealed the intranuclear presence of TiPV DNA in multiple tissues, including the liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, gills, and the membrane of oocytes in the ovary. These findings suggest that although TiPV can replicate in several tissue types, CAIB manifest exclusively in pancreatic tissues. In addition to TiPV, most diseased fish were co-infected with Streptococcus agalactiae, and presented with multifocal granulomas secondary to this bacterial infection. Partial genome amplification of TiPV was successful and revealed high nucleotide identity (> 99%) to previously reported isolates. In summary, this study highlights the usefulness of pancreatic tissue as a prime target for histopathological diagnosis of TiPV in diseased Nile tilapia. This pattern may be critical when determining the presence of TiPV infection in new geographic areas, where ancillary testing may not be available. TiPV pathogenesis in this landmark organ warrants further investigation.",

Although the psychosocial and eco-evolutionary factors associated with this antisocial behavior have repeatedly been studied, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unknown mainly due to the lack of an appropriate animal model of sexual aggression (SxA). Here, we established a novel paradigm to provoke and subsequently assess SxA in adult male Wistar rats: the sexual aggression test (SxAT). Briefly, male Wistar rats are sexually aroused by a receptive female, which is exchanged by a non-receptive female immediately after the first intromission. This protocol elicits forced mounting (FM) and aggressive behavior (AB) towards the non-receptive female to different degrees, which can be scored. In a series of experiments we can show that SxA behavior is a relatively stable trait in rats and correlates positively with sexual motivation. Rats with innate abnormal anxiety and aggressive behavior also show abnormal SxA behavior. In addition, central infusion of oxytocin moderately inhibits AB, but increases FM. Finally, we identified the agranular insular cortex to be specifically activated by SxA, and inhibition of this region mildly decreased AB during the SxAT.\n\nAltogether, the SxAT is a paradigm that can be readily implemented in behavioral laboratories as a valuable tool to find answers regarding the biological mechanisms underlying SxA in humans, as well as social decision-making in general.",

Lung cancer induced by oncogene mutations has been detected in the patients saliva, and saliva glycosylation has been altered. Saliva contains highly glycosylated glycoproteins, the characteristics of which may be related to various diseases. Therefore, elucidating cancer-specific glycosylation in the saliva of healthy, non-cancer, and cancer patients can reveal whether tumor glycosylation has unique characteristics for early diagnosis. In this work, we used a solid-phase chemoenzymatic method to study the glycosylation of saliva glycoproteins in clinical specimens. The results showed that the 1,6-core fucosylation of glycoproteins in cancer patients was significant increased. The fucosylation of 1,2 or 1,3 is also increased in cancer patients. We further analyzed the expression of fucosyltransferases responsible for 1,2, 1,3, 1,6 fucosylation. The fucosylation of the saliva of cancer patients is drastically different from that of non-cancer or health controls.

Animals reliably formed burrows in small mounds of sand we provided in the middle of circular, sandlined behavioral arenas. We processed overnight infrared video recordings with a MATLAB script that tracked animal movements at 1-2 s intervals. In all, we analyzed the movements of 23 animals, representing nearly 1500 hours of video recording. We found that once animals established their home burrows, they immediately made one to several short, looping excursions away from and back to their burrows before walking greater distances. We also observed similar excursions when animals made burrows in level sand in the middle of the arena (i.e., no mound provided). These putative learning walks, together with recently reported PI in scorpions, may provide the crucial home-directed information requisite for NCFH.",

Relevant to this study, circRNAs have recently been described in the parasitic nematode, Haemonchus contortus, suggesting they may have functionally important roles in parasites. Given this involvement in regulating biological processes, a better understanding of their role in parasites could be leveraged for future control efforts. Here, we report the use of next-generation sequencing to identify 1,997 distinct circRNAs expressed in adult female stages of the gastrointestinal parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. We describe spatial expression in the ovaries and body wall muscle, and also report circRNA presence in extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the parasite into the external environment. Further, we used an in-silico approach to predict that a subset of Ascaris circRNAs bind both endogenous parasite miRNAs as well as human host miRNAs, suggesting they could be functional as both exogenous and endogenous miRNA sponges to alter gene expression. There was not a strong correlation between Ascaris circRNA length endogenous miRNA interactions, indicating Ascaris circRNAs are enriched for Ascaris miRNA binding sites, but that human miRNAs were predicted form a more thermodynamically stable bond with Ascaris circRNAs. These results suggest that secreted circRNAs could be interacting with host miRNAs at the host-parasite interface and influencing host gene transcription. Lastly, although we previously found that therapeutically relevant concentrations of the anthelmintic drug ivermectin inhibited EV release from parasitic nematodes, we did not observe a direct effect on Ascaris circRNAs expression or secretion.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Clostridioides difficile causes gastroenteritis through its production of toxins and transmits disease through its production of resistant spores. Toxin and spore production are energy-expensive processes that are regulated by multiple transcription factors in response to many nutritional inputs. While toxin and sporulation genes are both heterogeneously expressed in only a subset of C. difficile cells, the relationship between these two sub-populations remains unclear. To address whether C. difficile coordinates the generation of these sub-populations, we developed a dual transcriptional reporter system that allows toxin and sporulation gene expression to be simultaneously visualized at the single-cell level using chromosomally-encoded mScarlet and mNeonGreen fluorescent transcriptional reporters. We then adapted an automated image analysis pipeline to quantify toxin and sporulation gene expression in thousands of individual cells in different media conditions and genetic backgrounds. These analyses revealed that toxin and sporulation gene expression rarely overlap during growth on agar plates, but broth culture increases this overlap in a manner dependent on the multifunctional RstA transcriptional regulator. Our results suggest that certain growth conditions promote a \"division of labor\" between transmission and virulence gene expression, highlighting how these subpopulations are influenced by environmental inputs. Given that recent work has revealed population-wide heterogeneity for numerous cellular processes in C. difficile, we anticipate that our dual reporter system will be broadly useful for determining the overlap in these subpopulations.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes severe diarrhea by producing toxins and is transmitted by producing spores. While both processes are crucial for C. difficile disease, only a subset of cells express toxins and/or undergo sporulation. Whether C. difficile coordinates the relationship between these energy-expensive processes remains unknown. We developed a dual fluorescent reporter system coupled with an automated image analysis pipeline to rapidly characterize expression two genes of interest across thousands of bacterial cells. Using this reporter system, we discovered that toxin and sporulation gene expression appear to undergo a \"division of labor\" in certain growth conditions, particularly during growth on agar plates. Since C. difficile specializes into subpopulations for numerous vital cellular processes, this novel dual reporter system will enable future studies aimed at understanding how C. difficile coordinates various subpopulations throughout its infectious disease cycle.",

This pathogen possesses a two-stage life cycle consisting of an environmentally stable cyst and a pathogenic amoeboid trophozoite. Since infection is acquired by ingestion of cysts from contaminated food and water, this parasite is prevalent in underdeveloped countries. A reptilian pathogen, Entamoeba invadens, which can encyst in culture, has long-served as a surrogate to study stage conversion. In the host, the Entamoebae must manage stress including nutrient deprivation and host immune pressure. In many systems, the stress response is characterized by down-regulation of translation, which is initiated by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2). In mammalian cells, this phosphorylation is carried out by a family of eIF2 kinases. A canonical eIF2 translational control system exists in the Entamoebae; however, no eIF2 kinases have been characterized. In this study, we identified two eIF2 kinases in E. invadens, EiIF2K-A and EiIF2K-B. Their identity as eIF2 kinases was validated using a heterologous yeast system. We used an RNAi Trigger-mediated silencing system to reduce expression of EiIF2K-A, which also reduced expression of EiIF2K-B. Parasites with decreased kinase expression exhibited decreased phosphorylation of eIF2 and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Diminished kinase expression also correlates with an increased rate of encystation, a decreased the rate of excystation, and an increase in several virulence functions, erythrophagocytosis and adhesion to host cells. Taken together, these data suggest that EiIF2K-A and EiIF2K-B are authentic eIF2 kinases that may regulate the Entamoeba stress response.\n\nImportanceEntamoeba histolytica is a human pathogen that causes dysentery and affects millions of people worldwide. This parasite possesses a two-stage life cycle: an environmentally stable cyst and the pathogenic trophozoite. Cysts are ingested from contaminated food and water; thus, this parasite in prevalent in underdeveloped countries. Current therapies commonly cause adverse side effects; therefore, new treatments are needed. In the host, Entamoeba experiences stress brought on, in part, by the host immune system. Understanding stage conversion and the stress response of this pathogen may lead to new drug therapies. Using the model organism, E. invadens, we identified two kinases, similar to those involved in stress and stage conversion in other systems. We determined that these kinases may regulate the oxidative stress response, stage conversion, and virulence. This work is significant as it will inform future studies on the life cycle and pathogenicity of the Entamoeba species.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Adaptive radiations involve astounding bursts of phenotypic, ecological, and species diversity. However, the microevolutionary processes that underlie the origins of these bursts are still poorly understood. We report the discovery of an intermediate  wide-mouth scale-eating ecomorph in a sympatric radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes, illuminating the transition from a widespread algae-eating generalist to a novel microendemic scale-eating specialist. We first show that this ecomorph occurs in sympatry with generalist C. variegatus and scale-eating specialist C. desquamator on San Salvador Island, Bahamas, but is genetically differentiated, morphologically distinct, and often consumes scales. We then compared the timing of selective sweeps on shared and unique adaptive variants in trophic specialists to characterize their adaptive walk. Shared adaptive regions swept first in both the specialist desquamator and the intermediate  wide-mouth ecomorph, followed by unique sweeps of introgressed variation in  wide-mouth and de novo variation in desquamator. The two scale-eating populations additionally shared 9% of their hard selective sweeps with molluscivores C. brontotheroides, despite no single common ancestor among specialists. Our work provides a new microevolutionary framework for investigating how major ecological transitions occur and illustrates how both shared and unique genetic variation can provide a bridge for multiple species to access novel ecological niches.",

The optimal asymptotic (long term) growth rate of this model was studied elsewhere; we further expand these results by discussing finite time growth rate fluctuations. An exact asymptotic expression for the variance, alongside with approximations valid in different regimes, are tested numerically in details. Our simulations of the dynamics suggest a close connection between this variance and the extinction probability, understood as risk for the population. Motivated by an earlier trade-off analysis between average capital growth rate and risk in Kellys gambling model, we study the trade-off between the average growth rate and the variance in the present model. Despite considerable differences between the two models, we find similar optimal trade-off curves (Pareto fronts), suggesting that our conclusions are robust, and broadly applicable in various fields ranging from biology/ecology to economics.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe association between brain metabolic change and ischemic stroke has attracted a lot of attention in the research community. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is widely used to measure the metabolism. In experiments, ischemic stroke is usually induced through middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and quality assessment of this procedure is of vital importance. However, an assessment method based on FDG PET images is still lacking. Herein, we propose an image feature-based protocol to assess the quality of the procedure.\n\nMethodsWe performed permanent MCAO to a total of 161 Sprague-Dawley rats. FDG micro-PET images were acquired both before and after the MCAO procedure. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was also conducted to obtain ground truth of the infarct volume. After preprocessing of the PET images, a combination of 3D scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and support vector machine (SVM) was applied to extract features and train a classifier that can assess the quality of the MCAO procedure.\n\nResults106 rats and 212 images were used as training data to construct the classification model. The SVM classifier achieved over 98% accuracy in cross validation. 10 rats with TTC results showing infarction in the ipsilateral brain region served as validation data. Their images were tested by the classifier and all of them were categorized into the correct group. Finally, the remaining 45 rats from a separate experiment were treated as independent test data. The prediction accuracy for these 90 images reached the level of 91%. An online interface was constructed for users to upload their images and obtain the assessment results.\n\nConclusionThis feature-based protocol provides a convenient, accurate and reliable tool to assess the quality of the MCAO procedure in FDG PET study.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The expression of Fibroblast growth factors (Fgf) ligands in a specialized epithelial compartment, the Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER), is a conserved feature of limb development across vertebrate species. In vertebrates, Fgf 4, 8, 9, and 17 are all expressed in the AER. An exception to this paradigm is the salamander (axolotl) developing and regenerating limb, where key Fgf ligands are expressed in the mesenchyme. The mesenchymal expression of Amex.Fgf8 in axolotl has been suggested to be critical for regeneration. To date, there is little knowledge regarding what controls Amex.Fgf8 expression in the axolotl limb mesenchyme. A large body of mouse and chick studies have defined a set of transcription factors and canonical Wnt signaling as the main regulators of epidermal Fgf8 expression in these organisms. In this study, we address the hypothesis that alterations to one or more of these components during evolution has resulted in mesenchymal Amex.Fgf8 expression in the axolotl. To sensitively quantify gene expression with spatial precision, we combined optical clearing of whole-mount axolotl limb tissue with single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and a semi-automated quantification pipeline. Several candidate upstream components were found expressed in the axolotl ectoderm, indicating that they are not direct regulators of Amex.Fgf8 expression. We found that Amex.Wnt3a is expressed in axolotl limb epidermis, similarly to chicken and mouse. However, unlike in amniotes, Wnt target genes are activated preferentially in limb mesenchyme rather than in epidermis. Inhibition and activation of Wnt signaling results in downregulation and upregulation of mesenchymal Amex.Fgf8 expression respectively. These results implicate a shift in tissue responsiveness to canonical Wnt signaling from epidermis to mesenchyme as one step contributing to the unique mesenchymal Amex.Fgf8 expression seen in the axolotl.",

Developing new tools for fast and accurate estimation of chlorophyll parameters, chlorophyll a (Chl-a), chlorophyll b (Chl-b) content, and their ratio (Chl-a/b), can promote breeding programs of wheat with enhanced climate adaptively. Spectral reflectance of leaves is affected by changes in pigments concentration and can be used to estimate chlorophyll parameters. The current study identified and validated the top spectral indices known and developed new vegetation indices (VIs) for Chl-a and Chl-b content estimation and used them to non-destructively estimate Chl-a/b values and compare them to hyperspectral estimations. Three wild emmer introgression lines, with contrasting drought stress responsiveness dynamics, were selected. Well and limited irrigation irrigation regimes were applied. The wheat leaves were spectrally measured with a handheld spectrometer to acquire their reflectance at the 330 to 790 nm range. Regression models based on calculated VIs as well as all hyperspectral curves were calibrated and validated against chlorophyll extracted values. The developed VIs resulted in high accuracy of Chl-a and Chl-b estimation allowing indirect non-destructive estimation of Chl-a/b with root mean square error (RMSE) values that could fit 6 to 10 times in the range of the measured values. They also performed similarly to the hyperspectral models. Altogether, we present here a new tool for a non-destructive estimation of Chl-a/b which can serve as a basis for future breeding efforts of climate-resilience wheat as well as other crops.",

The cohesin protein complex comprises of RAD21, SMC3, SMC1A as well as a fourth subunit that consists of either STAG1 or STAG2 and is essential for proper chromosomal segregation during mitosis. STAG2 loss-of-function mutations are recurrent driver events in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and appear relatively early during leukemogenesis. Studies in cell lines have shown that STAG2 deficient cells are uniquely vulnerable to STAG1 perturbation, and this vulnerability could thus be exploited to selectively eliminate STAG2 null AML cells. Here we show that partial perturbation of STAG1 is well tolerated by normal human hematopoietic stem cells and does not affect their functionality. By contrast, STAG1 knockdown is lethal to STAG2 null human HSCs by inducing major mitotic defects. Moreover, STAG1 knockdown induced synthetic lethality in primary human AML cells harboring a STAG2 mutation and completely abrogated leukemia progression in xenograft models. Overall, our study provides proof-of-concept demonstration of a synthetic lethal approach to selectively target primary human cancer cells with STAG2 mutations",

Increasingly contagious variants of concern (VoC) have fueled recurring global infection waves. A major question is the relative severity of disease caused by the previous and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 variants in human ACE-2-expressing (K18-hACE2) mice. Eight-week-old K18-hACE2 mice were inoculated intranasally with a representative virus from the original B.1 lineage, or the emerging B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta) or B.1.1.529 (omicron) lineages. We also infected a group of mice with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10). Our results demonstrate that B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 viruses are significantly more lethal than B.1 strain in K18-hACE2 mice. Infection with B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 variants resulted in significantly higher virus titers in the lungs and brain of mice compared to the B.1 virus. Interestingly, mice infected with the B.1.1.529 variant exhibited less severe clinical signs and high survival rate. We found that B.1.1.529 replication was significantly lower in the lungs and brain of infected mice in comparison to other VoC. Transcription levels of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of the B.1.1.529-infected mice were significantly less when compared to those challenged with the B.1.1.7 virus. Together, our data provide insights into the pathogenesis of the previous and circulating SARS-CoV-2 VoC in mice.",

We sequenced fly larvae salivary glands and identified a novel jingmenvirus, putatively named Inopus flavus jingmenvirus 1 (IFJV1). Phylogenetic trees confirmed that IFJV1 groups with insect-associated jingmenviruses, newly identified flavivirus-like viruses with a segmented genome. After the design and validation of molecular detection systems for IFJV1, larval homogenates were passaged on insect and vertebrate cells but IFJV1 could only be detected in the first two passages in insect cells and not at all in vertebrate cells. Despite this lack of consistent replication in laboratory models, this virus does replicate in its host Inopus flavus, as sequenced small RNA from larvae match the IFJV1 sequences, are predominantly 21 nucleotides-long and map to the whole sequences on both strands, which is typical of an actively replicating virus. This discovery confirms the worldwide presence of jingmenviruses, which until now had only been detected on four continents. However, the study of IFJV1 tropism and of the possible pathogenicity to its host or the sugarcane it parasitizes requires the development of a stable replication model.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Actin is one of the key structural components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton that regulates cellular architecture and mechanical properties. Dynamic regulation of actin filament length and organization is essential for the control of many physiological processes including cell adhesion, motility and division. While previous studies have mostly focused on the mechanisms controlling the mean length of individual actin filaments, it remains poorly understood how distinct actin filament populations in cells maintain different lengths using the same set of molecular building blocks. Here we develop a theoretical model for the length regulation of multiple actin filaments by nucleation and growth rate modulation by actin binding proteins in a limiting pool of monomers. We first show that spontaneous nucleation of actin filaments naturally leads to heterogeneities in filament length distribution. We then investigate the effects of filament growth inhibition by capping proteins and growth promotion by formin proteins on filament length distribution. We find that filament length heterogeneity can be increased by growth inhibition, whereas growth promoters do not significantly affect length heterogeneity. Interestingly, a competition between filament growth inhibitors and growth promoters can give rise to bimodal filament length distribution as well as a highly heterogeneous length distribution with large statistical dispersion. We quantitatively predict how heterogeneity in actin filament length can be modulated by tuning F-actin nucleation and growth rates in order to create distinct filament subpopulations with different lengths.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEActin filaments organize into different functional network architectures within eukaryotic cells. To maintain distinct actin network architectures, it is essential to regulate the lengths of actin filaments. While the mechanisms controlling the lengths of individual actin filaments have been extensively studied, the regulation of length heterogeneity in actin filament populations is not well understood. Here we show that the modulation of actin filament growth and nucleation rates by actin binding proteins can regulate actin length distribution and create distinct sub-populations with different lengths. In particular, by tuning concentrations of formin, profilin and capping proteins, various aspects of actin filament length distribution can be controlled. Insights gained from our results may have significant implications for the regulation of actin filament length heterogeneity and architecture within a cell.",

However, our results with siRNAs targeting MKLP2 and small molecule inhibitors of MKLP2 (MKLP2i) suggested a function earlier in mitosis, prior to anaphase. In this study we provide direct evidence that MKLP2 facilitates chromosome congression in prometaphase. We employed live imaging to observe HeLa cells with fluorescently tagged histones treated with MKLP2i and discovered a pronounced chromosome congression defect. We show that MKLP2 is essential for pole-based error correction as inhibited cells had a significant increase in unstable kinetochore-microtubule attachments due to impaired error correction of syntelic attachments. We propose that MKLP2 mediates kinetochore microtubule attachment stability by regulating Aurora Kinase activity and a downstream target, pHEC1 (Ser 55). Lastly, we show that MKLP2 inhibition results in aneuploidy, confirming that MKLP2 safeguards cells against chromosomal instability.\n\nSummarySchrock et al. demonstrate that the mitotic kinesin, MKLP2, is required for congression of chromosomes located near the spindle poles.

Hyperphosphorylated tau, a known AD pathological characteristic, has been prematurely increased in the brains of HIV-infected patients as early as in their 30s and is increased with age. This thus suggests that HIV infection may lead to accelerated AD phenotypes. However, whether HIV infection causes AD to develop more quickly in the brain is not yet fully determined. Interestingly, we have previously revealed that viral glycoproteins, HIV gp120 and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) gp95, induce neuronal hyperexcitation via cGMP-dependent kinase II (cGKII) activation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Here, we use cultured mouse cortical neurons to demonstrate that HIV gp120 and FIV gp95 are sufficient to increase cellular tau pathology, including intracellular tau hyperphosphorylation and tau release to the extracellular space. We further reveal that viral glycoprotein-induced cellular tau pathology requires cGKII activation. Together, HIV infection likely accelerates AD-related tau pathology via cGKII activation.",

Moreover, application of the classifiers to histological sections from normal tissues suggest the presence of a hypoxic gene expression pattern in the kidney cortex not observed in other normoxic organs. Finally, tree classifiers described herein outperform traditional hypoxic gene signatures when compared against a wide range of datasets.

    "preprint_abstract": "RNA sequencing has become the method of choice to study the transcriptional landscape of phage-infected bacteria. However, short-read RNA sequencing approaches generally fail to capture the primary 5 and 3 boundaries of transcripts, confounding the discovery of key transcription initiation and termination events as well as operon architectures. Yet, the elucidation of these elements is crucial for the understanding of the strategy of transcription regulation during the infection process, which is currently lacking beyond a handful of model phages. To this end, we developed ONT-cappable-seq, a specialized long-read RNA sequencing technique that allows end-to-end sequencing of primary prokaryotic transcripts using the Nanopore sequencing platform. We applied ONT-cappable-seq to study transcription of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LUZ7, obtaining a comprehensive genome-wide map of viral transcription start sites, terminators, and complex operon structures that fine-regulate gene expression. Our work provides new insights in the RNA biology of a non-model phage, unveiling distinct promoter architectures, putative small non-coding viral RNAs, and the prominent regulatory role of terminators during infection. The robust workflow presented here offers a framework to obtain a global, yet fine-grained view of phage transcription and paves the way for standardized, in depth transcription studies for microbial viruses or bacteria in general.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cortical bone quality, which is sexually dimorphic, depends on bone turnover and therefore the activities of remodeling bone cells. However, sex differences in cortical bone metabolism are not yet defined. Adding to the uncertainty about cortical bone metabolism, the metabolomes of whole bone, isolated cortical bone without marrow, and bone marrow have not been compared. We hypothesized that the metabolome of isolated cortical bone would be distinct from that of bone marrow and would reveal sex differences. Metabolite profiles from LC-MS of whole bone, isolated cortical bone, and bone marrow were generated from humeri from 20-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice. The cortical bone metabolomes were then compared for 20-week-old female and male C57Bl/6J mice. Femurs from male and female mice were evaluated for flexural material properties and were then categorized into bone strength groups. The metabolome of isolated cortical bone was distinct from both whole bone and bone marrow. We also found sex differences in the isolated cortical bone metabolome. Based on metabolite pathway analysis, females had higher lipid metabolism, and males had higher amino acid metabolism. High-strength bones, regardless of sex, had greater tryptophan and purine metabolism. For males, high strength bones had upregulated nucleotide metabolism, whereas lower strength bones had greater pentose phosphate pathway metabolism. Since the higher strength groups (females compared with males, high strength males compared with lower strength males) had higher serum CTX1/P1NP, we estimate that the metabolomic signature of bone strength in our study at least partially reflects differences in bone turnover. These data provide novel insight into bone bioenergetics and the sexual dimorphic nature of bone material properties in C57Bl/6 mice.",

Selected microbes degrade plant fibers using extremely efficient multi-enzymatic cellulosomes assemblies. Organization of cellulosomes on the bacterial cell surface and their ecological regulation remain elusive. By combining structural methodologies with molecular and biochemical approaches on the canonical Clostridium thermocellum system, we provide an unprecedented view into the in-situ structure and distribution of cellulosomal enzymes while interacting with their cellulosic substrate during fiber degradation. Structural exploration of growing cultures revealed isogenic phenotypic heterogeneity of cellulosome organization on single cells across the bacterial population, suggesting a division-of labor strategy driven by product-dependent dynamics.

We report here that DNA damage induces apoptosis of epidermal basal cells (EBCs) in zebrafish yap1-/-;wwtr1-/- embryos. Specifically, these mutant EBCs exhibit active Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and {gamma}H2AX, consistent with DNA damage serving as a stimulus of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in epidermal cells. Live imaging of zebrafish epidermal cells reveals a steady growth of basal cell size in the developing embryo, but this growth is inhibited in mutant basal cells followed by apoptosis, leading to the hypothesis that factors underscoring cell size play a role in this DNA damage-induced apoptosis phenotype. We tested two of these factors using cell stretching and substrate stiffness assays, and found that HaCaT cells cultured on stiff substrates exhibit more numerous {gamma}H2AX foci compared to ones cultured on soft substrates. Thus, we propose that substrate rigidity modulates genomic stress in the developing epidermal cell, and that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are required for its survival.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundPlatinum based agents - cisplatin and carboplatin in combination with taxanes are used for the treatment of ovarian cancer (OC) patients. However, the majority of OC patients develop recurrent, platinum resistant disease that is uniformly fatal. Acute platinum treatment enriches for chemoresistant aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) + ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs), which contribute to tumor recurrence and disease relapse. Acquired platinum resistance includes metabolic reprograming and switching to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Chemosensitive cells rely on glycolysis while chemoresistant cells have the ability to switch between glycolysis and OXPHOS, depending on which pathway drives a selective advantage for growth and chemoresistance. High expression of genes involved in OXPHOS and high production of mitochondrial ROS are characteristics of OCSCs, suggesting that OCSCs favor OXPHOS over glycolysis. Based on connections between OCSCs, chemoresistance and OXPHOS, we hypothesize that platinum treatment induces changes in metabolism that contribute to platinum-induced enrichment of OCSCs.\n\nMethodsThe effect of cisplatin on mitochondrial activity was assessed by JC1 staining and expression of OXPHOS genes by quantitative RTPCR. Cisplatin-induced changes in Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) levels and activity were assessed by Western blot. Small molecule inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and SIRT1 were used to determine if their enzymatic activity contributes to the platinum-induced enrichment of OCSCs. The percentage of ALDH+ OCSCs in OC cells and tumor tissue from xenograft models across different treatment conditions was analyzed using ALDEFLUOR assay and flow cytometry.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that acute platinum treatment increases mitochondrial activity. Combined treatment of platinum agents and OXPHOS inhibitors blocks the platinum-induced enrichment of ALDH+ OCSCs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, platinum treatment increases SIRT1 levels and subsequent deacetylase activity, which likely contributes to the increase in platinum-induced mitochondrial activity.\n\nConclusionsThese findings on metabolic pathways altered by platinum-based chemotherapy have uncovered key targets that can be exploited therapeutically to block the platinum-induced enrichment of OCSCs, ultimately improving the survival of OC patients.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen of growing concern, as isolates are commonly multidrug resistant. While A. baumannii is most frequently associated with pulmonary infections, a significant proportion of clinical isolates come from urinary sources, highlighting its uropathogenic potential. The type II secretion system (T2SS) of commonly used model Acinetobacter strains is important for virulence in various animal models, but the potential role of the T2SS in urinary tract infection (UTI) remains unknown. Herein, we used a catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) model to demonstrate that a modern urinary isolate, UPAB1, requires the T2SS for full virulence. A proteomic screen to identify putative UPAB1 T2SS effectors revealed an uncharacterized lipoprotein with structural similarity to the intimin-invasin family, which serve as type V secretion system (T5SS) adhesins required for the pathogenesis of several bacteria. This protein, designated InvL, lacked the {beta}-barrel domain associated with T5SSs, but was confirmed to require the T2SS for both surface localization and secretion. This makes InvL the first identified T2SS effector belonging to the intimin-invasin family. InvL was confirmed to be an adhesin, as the protein bound to extracellular matrix components and mediated adhesion to urinary tract cell lines in vitro. Additionally, the invL mutant was attenuated in the CAUTI model, indicating a role in Acinetobacter uropathogenesis. Finally, bioinformatic analyses revealed that InvL is present in nearly all clinical isolates belonging to international clone 2, a lineage of significant clinical importance. In all, we conclude that the T2SS substrate InvL is an adhesin required for A. baumannii uropathogenesis.\n\nIMPORTANCEWhile pathogenic Acinetobacter can cause various infections, we recently found that 20% of clinical isolates come from urinary sources. Despite the clinical relevance of Acinetobacter as a uropathogen, few virulence factors involved in urinary tract colonization have been defined. Herein, we identify a novel type II secretion system effector, InvL, which is required for full uropathogenesis by a modern urinary isolate. Though InvL has predicted structural similarity to the intimin-invasin family of autotransporter adhesins, InvL is predicted to be anchored to the membrane as a lipoprotein. Similar to other invasin homologs however, we demonstrate that InvL is a bona fide adhesin capable of binding extracellular matrix components and mediating adhesion to urinary tract cell lines. In all, this work establishes InvL as an adhesin important for Acinetobacters urinary tract virulence, and represents the first report of a type II secretion system effector belonging to the intimin-invasin family.",

Time-resolved optical oxygen mapping, microscopy and metabolite analysis revealed the formation and persistence of anoxic circum hyphal niches allowing for spore germination, growth and fermentative activity of the obligate anaerobe in an otherwise oxic environment. Hypoxic liquid films containing 80 {+/-} 10% of atmospheric oxygen saturation around single air-exposed hyphae thereby allowed for efficient clostridial dispersal amid spatially separated (>0.5 cm) anoxic sites.

    "preprint_abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is supplemented in microbial media with varying benefits across species and growth conditions. We found that growth of Lactococcus cremoris was unaffected by manganese omission from the growth medium. The main proteome adaptation to manganese omission involved increased manganese transporter production (up to 2000-fold), while the remaining 10 significant proteome changes were between 1.4 and 4 fold. Further investigation in translationally-blocked (TB), non-growing cells showed that Mn supplementation (20 M) led to approximately 1.5X faster acidification compared to Mn-free conditions. However, this faster acidification stagnated within 24 hours, likely due to draining of intracellular NADH that coincides with substantial loss of culturability. Conversely, without manganese, non-growing cells persisted to acidify for weeks, albeit at a reduced rate, but maintaining redox balance and culturability. Strikingly, despite being unculturable, -keto acid-derived aldehydes continued to accumulate in cells incubated in the presence of manganese, whereas without manganese cells predominantly formed the corresponding alcohols. This is most likely reflecting NADH availability for the alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed conversion. Overall, manganese influences the lactococcal acidification rate, and flavor formation capacity in a redox dependent manner. These are important industrial traits especially during cheese ripening, where cells are in a non-growing, often unculturable state.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The current classification of the phylum Firmicutes (new name, Bacillota) features eight distinct classes, six of which include known spore-forming bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis, sporulation involves up to 500 genes, many of which do not have orthologs in other bacilli and/or clostridia. Previous studies identified about 60 sporulation genes of B. subtilis that were shared by all spore-forming members of the Firmicutes. These genes are referred to as the sporulation core or signature although many of these are found also in genomes of non-spore-formers. Using an expanded set of 180 firmicute genomes from 160 genera, including 76 spore-forming species, we investigated the conservation of the sporulation genes, in particular, seeking to identify lineages that lack some of the genes from the conserved sporulation core. The results of this analysis confirmed that many small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASPs), spore coat proteins, and germination proteins, which were previously characterized in bacilli, are missing in spore-forming members of Clostridia and other classes of Firmicutes. A particularly dramatic loss of sporulation genes was observed in the spore-forming members of the families Planococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae. Fifteen species from diverse lineages were found to carry skin (sigK-interrupting) elements of different sizes that all encoded SpoIVCA-like recombinases but did not share any other genes. Phylogenetic trees built from concatenated alignments of sporulation proteins and ribosomal proteins showed similar topology, indicating an early origin and subsequent vertical inheritance of the sporulation genes.\n\nIMPORTANCEMany members of the phylum Firmicutes (Bacillota) are capable of producing endospores, which enhance the survival of important Gram-positive pathogens that cause such diseases as anthrax, botulism, colitis, gas gangrene, and tetanus. We show that the core set of sporulation genes, defined previously through genome comparisons of several bacilli and clostridia, is conserved in a wide variety of spore-formers from several distinct lineages of Firmicutes. We also detect widespread loss of sporulation genes in many organisms, particularly within families Planococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae. Members of these families, such as Lysinobacillus sphaericus and Clostridium innocuum, could be excellent model organisms for studying sporulation mechanisms, such as engulfment, formation of the spore coat, and spore germination.",

Despite being overrepresented in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), their individual physiological roles remain elusive. We describe a TA system in Mtb which we have named TacAT due to its homology to previously discovered systems in Salmonella. The toxin, TacT, blocks growth by acetylating glycyl-tRNAs and inhibiting translation. Its effects are reversed by the enzyme peptidyl tRNA hydrolase (Pth), which also cleaves peptidyl tRNAs that are prematurely released from stalled ribosomes. Pth is essential in most bacteria and thereby has been proposed as a promising drug target for complex pathogens like Mtb. Transposon sequencing data suggest that the tacAT operon is nonessential for Mtb growth in vitro, and premature stop mutations in this TA system present in some clinical isolates suggest that it is also dispensable in vivo. We assessed whether TacT modulates pth essentiality in Mtb, as drugs targeting Pth might be ineffective if TacAT is disrupted. We find that pth essentiality is unaffected by the absence of tacAT. These results highlight a fundamental aspect of mycobacterial biology and indicate that Pths essential role hinges on its peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity. Our work underscores Pths potential as a viable target for new antibiotics.",

    "preprint_abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic agent capable of infecting humans and a wide range of animal species. Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) have arisen in circulating viral populations, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOC) with varying degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we employed lentivirus-based pseudotyped viruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that stably express ACE2 from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the parental (prototype Wuhan-1) S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions (e.g., 452R, 478K, 501Y) did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency in viral entry. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with significantly increased entry capacity of pseudotyped viruses compared to that of the parental Wuhan-1 pseudotyped virus. Similarly, infection studies using live ancestral (USA-WA1/2020), Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 viruses in hamsters revealed a higher replication potential for the Beta variant compared to the ancestral prototype virus. Moreover, neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species, including humans, were significantly reduced by single substitutions of 484K or 452R, double substitutions of 501Y-484K, 452R-484K and 452R-478K and the triple substitution of 501Y-484K-417N, suggesting that 484K and 452R are particularly important for evading neutralizing antibodies in human, cat, and rabbit sera. Cumulatively, this study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication and antibody-mediated viral neutralization.\n\nAuthor summaryCells stably expressing ACE2 from various animals and a lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus assay were established to study SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The results demonstrated that ACE2 from a wide range of animal species facilitate S-mediated virus entry into cells, which is supported by in silico data as well as natural and experimental infection studies. Pseudotyped viruses containing mutations in the RBD of S representative of the Alpha, Gamma, and especially Beta, variants of concern demonstrated that certain mutations are associated with increased viral entry compared to the parental S. The Beta variant was also observed to have a replicative advantage in vitro and in vivo compared to the prototype virus. Pseudotyped viruses containing combinatorial substitutions of 501Y-484K-417K, 614G-501Y-484K and 614G-501Y-484K-417N increased viral entry via ACE2 across multiple species. The 501Y or 478K single substitution did not significantly affect neutralizing capacity of immune sera compared to the prototype strain, but the addition of 484K or 452R substitutions significantly reduced the neutralizing titers.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacillus subtilis exhibits swarming motility, a flagellar-mediated form of surface motility. Here we use high-throughput transposon mutagenesis and sequencing (TnSeq) to identify candidate genes required for swarming. The TnSeq approach identified all of the known genes required for flagellar biosynthesis as well as nearly all of the previously reported regulators that promote swarming. Moreover, we identified an additional 36 genes that improve swarming and validated them individually. Among these, two mutants with severe defects were recovered including fliT, required for flagellar biosynthesis, and a gene of unknown function yolB, whose defect could not be attributed to a lack of flagella. Our work indicates that TnSeq is a powerful approach for the identification of genes required for motility that drives outward expansion of a colony on plates.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn TnSeq, transposons are randomly inserted throughout the chromosome at a population level, but insertions that disrupt genes of essential function cause strains that carry them to fall out of the population and appear under-represented at the sequence level. Here we apply TnSeq to the non-essential phenotype of motility in B. subtilis and spatially select for cells proficient in swarming. We find that insertions in nearly all genes previously identified as required for swarming are under-represented in TnSeq analysis, and we identify 36 additional genes that enhance swarming. We suggest that TnSeq is a powerful tool for the genetic analysis of motility and likely other non-lethal screens for which enrichment is strong.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The remarkable ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer DNA to plant cells has allowed the generation of important transgenic crops. One challenge of A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation is eliminating the bacteria after plant transformation to prevent detrimental effects to plants and the release of engineered bacteria to the environment. Here we use a reverse genetics approach to identify genes involved in ampicillin resistance with the goal of utilizing these antibiotic-sensitive strains for plant transformations. We show that treating A. tumefaciens C58 with ampicillin led to increased {beta}-lactamase production, a response dependent on the broad-spectrum {beta}-lactamase AmpC and its transcription factor AmpR. Loss of the putative ampD orthologue, atu2113, led to constitutive production of AmpC-dependent {beta}-lactamase activity and ampicillin resistance. Finally, one cell wall remodeling enzyme, MltB3, was necessary for the AmpC-dependent {beta}-lactamase activity and its loss elicited ampicillin and carbenicillin sensitivity in the A. tumefaciens C58 and GV3101 strains. Furthermore, GV3101{Delta} mltB3 transforms plants with comparable efficiency to wildtype but can be cleared with sub-lethal concentrations of ampicillin. The functional characterization of the genes involved in the inducible ampicillin resistance pathway of A. tumefaciens constitutes a major step forward in efforts to reduce the intrinsic antibiotic resistance of this bacterium.\n\nIMPORTANCEAgrobacterium tumefaciens, a significant biotechnological tool for production of transgenic plant lines, is highly resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, posing challenges for various applications. One challenge is the efficient elimination of A. tumefaciens from transformed plant tissue without using levels of antibiotics that are toxic to the plants. Here, we present the functional characterization of genes involved in {beta}-lactam resistance in A. tumefaciens. Knowledge about proteins that promote or inhibit {beta}-lactam resistance will enable the development of strains to improve the efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformations. Effective removal of Agrobacterium from transformed plant tissue has the potential to maximize crop yield and food production, improving the outlook for global food security.",

Currently, two classes of methods prevail: Machine Learning (ML) models built on top of handcrafted features and comparative modeling. They are respectively limited by the expressivity of the handcrafted features and the availability of similar proteins. Here, we introduce ScanNet, an end-to-end, interpretable geometric deep learning model that learns features directly from 3D structures. ScanNet builds representations of atoms and amino acids based on the spatio-chemical arrangement of their neighbors. We train ScanNet for detecting protein-protein and protein-antibody binding sites, demonstrate its accuracy - including for unseen protein folds - and interpret the filters learned. Finally, we predict epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, validating known antigenic regions and predicting previously uncharacterized ones. Overall, ScanNet is a versatile, powerful, and interpretable model suitable for functional site prediction tasks. A webserver for ScanNet is available from http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/ScanNet/",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms. These bacteria are important models for both fundamental and Synthetic Biology, owing to their highly reduced genomes. They are also relevant in the medical and veterinary fields, as they are pathogenic of both humans and most livestock species. Mycoplasma cells have minute sizes, often in the 300-800 nanometers range. As these dimensions are close to the diffraction limit of visible light, fluorescence imaging in mycoplasmas is often poorly informative. Recently developed \"Super-Resolution Imaging\" techniques can break this diffraction limit, improving the imaging resolution by an order of magnitude and offering a new nanoscale vision of the organization of these bacteria. These techniques have however not been applied to mycoplasmas before. Here, we describe an efficient and reliable protocol to perform Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) imaging in mycoplasmas. We provide a polyvalent transposon-based system to express the photo-convertible fluorescent protein mEos3.2, enabling Photo-Activated Localization Microscopy (PALM) in most Mycoplasma species. We also describe the application of direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM). We showcase the potential of these techniques by studying the subcellular localization of two proteins of interest. Our work highlights the benefits of state-of-the-art microscopy techniques for mycoplasmology and provides an incentive to further the development SMLM strategies to study these organisms in the future.\n\nImportanceMycoplasmas are important models in biology, as well as highly problematic pathogens in the medical and veterinary fields. The very small size of these bacteria, well below the micron, limits the usefulness of traditional fluorescence imaging methods as their resolution limit is similar to the dimensions of the cells. Here, to bypass this issue, we established a set of state-of-the-art \"Super-Resolution Microscopy\" techniques in a wide range of Mycoplasma species. We describe two strategies: PALM, based on the expression of a specific photo-convertible fluorescent protein; and dSTORM, based on fluorophore-coupled antibody labeling. With these methods, we successfully performed single-molecule imaging of proteins of interest at the surface of the cells and in the cytoplasm, at lateral resolutions well below 50 nanometers. Our work paves the way toward a better understanding of mycoplasmas biology through imaging of subcellular structures at the nanometer scale.",

Radial migration during which neurons featuring unipolar and bipolar morphology, employ pre-existing processes or underlying cells for directional guidance, is the most well explored neuronal migration mode. However, how neurons that display multipolar morphology, without such processes, move through highly crowded tissue environments towards their final positions remains elusive. To understand this, we here investigated multipolar migration of horizontal cells in the zebrafish retina. We found that horizontal cells tailor their movements to the environmental spatial constraints of the crowded retina, by featuring several characteristics of amoeboid migration. These include cell and nucleus shape changes, and persistent rearward polarization of stable F-actin, which enable horizontal cells to successfully move through the crowded retina. Interference with the organization of the developing retina by changing nuclear properties or overall tissue architecture, hampers efficient horizontal cell migration and layer formation. Thus, cell-tissue interplay is crucial for efficient migration of horizontal cells in the retina. In view of high proportion of multipolar neurons, the here uncovered ameboid-like neuronal migration mode might also be crucial in other areas of the developing brain.",

Due to its amphiphilic character, however, TEMPO spin label could partition between aqueous and lipid phases, and may even be stabilized in the lipid phase. Accurate assessment of the TEMPO-PC configuration in bilayer membranes is essential for correctly interpreting the data from measurements. Here, we carry out all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TEMPO-PC probe in single-component lipid bilayers at varying temperatures, using two standard MD force fields. We find that for DPPC membrane whose gel-to-fluid lipid phase transition occurs at 314 K, TEMPO is stabilized above (below) the bilayer interface if the membrane is in the gel (fluid) phase. For bilayers made of unsaturated lipids, DOPC and POPC, which adopt the fluid phase at ambient temperature, TEMPO is unequivocally stabilized inside the bilayers. Our finding of membrane phase-dependent positioning of TEMPO moiety highlights the importance of assessing the packing order and fluidity of lipids under a given measurement condition.",

We generated a transgenic mouse model of reduced TREM2 shedding (Trem2-IPD) through amino acid substitution of ADAM-protease recognition site. We found that Trem2-IPD mice displayed increased TREM2 cell surface receptor load, survival and function in myeloid cells. Using single cell transcriptomic profiling of mouse cortex we show that sustained TREM2 stabilization induces a shift of fate in microglial maturation and accelerates microglial responses to A{beta} pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease.

Here we investigated protein expression and purification of ten different human Syx constructs and performed biophysical characterizations and computational studies that provide insights into why expression of this protein was previously intractable. We show that human Syx can be expressed and isolated and Syx is folded as observed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and actively binds to RhoA as determined by co-elution during size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

These simulations reveal novel insights into GEF activity and allosteric modulation by the plekstrin homology (PH) domain. These newly revealed interactions between the GEF PH domain and the membrane embedded region of RhoA support previously unexplained experimental findings regarding the allosteric effects of the PH domain from numerous activity studies of Dbl homology GEF proteins.

However, universal primers targeting the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) marker gene popular in metazoan studies have displayed high levels of nontarget amplification. To date, enrichment methods bypassing amplification have not been able to match the detection levels of conventional metabarcoding. This study evaluated the use of universal metabarcoding primers as capture probes to either isolate target DNA or to remove nontarget DNA, prior to amplification, by using biotinylated versions of universal metazoan and bacterial barcoding primers, namely metazoan COI (mlCOIintF) and bacterial 16S (515F). Additionally, each step of the protocol was assessed by amplifying for both metazoan COI (mlCOIintF/jgHCO2198) and bacterial 16S (515F/806R) to investigate the effect on the metazoan and bacterial communities. Bacterial read abundance increased significantly in response to the captures (COI library), while the quality of the captured DNA was also improved. The metazoan-based probe captured bacterial DNA in a range that was also amplifiable with the 16S primers, demonstrating the ability of universal capture probes to isolate larger fragments of DNA from eDNA. Although the use of the tested COI probe cannot be recommended for metazoan enrichment, based on the experimental results, the concept of capturing longer fragments could be applied to metazoan metabarcoding. By using a truly conserved site without a high-level taxonomic resolution as a target for capture, it may be possible to isolate DNA fragments large enough to span over a nearby barcoding region (e.g., COI), which can then be processed through a conventional metabarcoding-by-amplification protocol.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The biochemical reaction networks that regulate living systems are all stochastic to varying degrees. The resulting randomness affects biological outcomes at multiple scales, from the functional states of single proteins in a cell to the evolutionary trajectory of whole populations. Controlling how the distribution of these outcomes changes over time--via external interventions like time-varying concentrations of chemical species--is a complex challenge. In this work, we show how counterdiabatic (CD) driving, first developed to control quantum systems, provides a versatile tool for steering biological processes. We develop a practical graph-theoretic framework for CD driving in discrete-state continuous-time Markov networks. Though CD driving is limited to target trajectories that are instantaneous stationary states, we show how to generalize the approach to allow for non-stationary targets and local control--where only a subset of system states are targeted. The latter is particularly useful for biological implementations where there may be only a small number of available external control knobs, insufficient for global control. We derive simple graphical criteria for when local versus global control is possible. Finally, we illustrate the formalism with global control of a genetic regulatory switch and local control in chaperone-assisted protein folding. The derived control protocols in the chaperone system closely resemble natural control strategies seen in experimental measurements of heat shock response in yeast and E. coli.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Scale invariant neural dynamics are a relatively new but effective means of measuring changes in brain states as a result of varied cognitive load and task difficulty. This study is the first to test whether scale invariance (as measured by the Hurst exponent, H) can be used with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify cognitive load. We analyzed H extracted from the fNIRS time series while participants completed an N-back working memory task. Consistent with what has been demonstrated in fMRI, the current results showed that scale-invariance analysis significantly differentiated between task and rest periods as calculated from both oxy- (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) concentration changes. Results from both channel-averaged H and a multivariate partial least squares approach (Task PLS) demonstrated higher H during the 1-back task than the 2-back task. These results were stronger for H derived from HbR than from HbO. As fNIRS is relatively portable and robust to motion-related artifacts, these preliminary results shed light on the promising future of measuring cognitive load in real life settings.\n\nAuthor SummaryScale invariance reflects a pattern of self-similarity (or fractalness) across a time series of brain data. In human neuroscience studies using EEG and fMRI, higher scale invariance has been associated with individuals being in a state of minimal cognitive effort or while performing a relatively easy task compared to doing something more challenging. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a flexible neuroimaging technique that can be used in naturalistic settings and measures the same underlying biological signal as fMRI. We expected that, if scale invariant brain states are indeed robust indicators of cognitive load or task difficulty, we should be able to replicate previous findings in fNIRS. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that more scale invariant brain states are indeed associated with less cognitively demanding and more restful brain states in fNIRS data. This finding opens up a wide array of potential applications for monitoring cognitive load and fatigue in real-life settings, such as during driving, learning in schools, or during interpersonal interactions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Unlike traditional time series, the action sequences of human decision making usually involve many cognitive processes such as beliefs, desires, intentions and theory of mind, i.e. what others are thinking. This makes predicting human decision making challenging to be treated agnostically to the underlying psychological mechanisms. We propose to use a recurrent neural network architecture based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the time series of the actions taken by the human subjects at each step of their decision making, the first application of such methods in this research domain. In this study, we collate the human data from 8 published literature of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma comprising 168,386 individual decisions and postprocess them into 8,257 behavioral trajectories of 9 actions each for both players. Similarly, we collate 617 trajectories of 95 actions from 10 different published studies of Iowa Gambling Task experiments with healthy human subjects. We train our prediction networks on the behavioral data from these published psychological experiments of human decision making, and demonstrate a clear advantage over the state-of-the-art methods in predicting human decision making trajectories in both single-agent scenarios such as the Iowa Gambling Task and multi-agent scenarios such as the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma. In the prediction, we observe that the weights of the top performers tends to have a wider distribution, and a bigger bias in the LSTM networks, which suggests possible interpretations for the distribution of strategies adopted by each group.\n\nAuthor summaryThe challenge of predicting human decision is important for many application domains like economy, marketing and artificial intelligence. But the domain where the human behavior modeling is especially crucial is psychology, where the goal is to describe, explain and predict these behaviors. Within this domain, creating agents that effectively mimic human decision making is particularly important. However, despite the many behavioral tasks and analytical methods developed to simulate the process of human decision making in real situations, there have not been a predictive model that can well predict the human decision making trajectories in these psychological tasks. In this predictive modeling problem, we propose to use the long short-term memory networks (LSTM), a popular recurrent neural network architecture and effectively predict the time series of the actions taken by the human subjects at each step of their decision making in both the Iowa Gambling Task, a single-agent game with monetary reward, and the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma, a complex multi-agent social game with non-monetary capital at stake. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of such methods in this research domain.",

As host resistance is an efficient tool to control diseases, the findings of a previous report showed that some corn hybrids are resistant to D. maidis. In this work, we assessed the probing behavior of D. maidis on susceptible and resistant corn hybrids using EPG (Electrical Penetration Graph) technology. Fifteen-day-old females were monitored for 20 hours, with access to hybrids DK390, DK670, DK79-10, and DK72-10. Hybrids DK390 and DK72-10 showed resistance to D. maidis in phloem, since insects feeding on these hybrids presented more salivation events in phloem without subsequent ingestion, which are seen as failed attempts to ingest. A reduction of the total duration of phloem ingestion was observed, and accordingly of the time spent by insects with access to these hybrids on xylem ingestion. The hybrid DK390 also had mesophyll resistance, seen as less probing time and a higher number of probes of short duration. These findings support and are consistent with previous research, providing useful information to characterize maize hybrids resistant to D. maidis, and so to corn stunt.",

This disease affects [~]100,000 people in the United States and millions worldwide. An effective therapy for SCD is fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction by pharmacologic agents such as hydroxyurea, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for this purpose. Therefore, the goal of our study was to determine whether salubrinal (SAL), a selective protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor, induces HbF expression through the stress-signaling pathway by activation of p-eIF2 and ATF4 trans-activation in the {gamma}-globin gene promoter. Sickle erythroid progenitors treated with 24{micro}M SAL increased F-cells levels 1.4-fold (p=0.021) and produced an 80% decrease in reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis showed SAL enhanced HbF protein by 1.6-fold (p=0.0441), along with dose-dependent increases of p-eIF2 and ATF4 levels. Subsequent treatment of SCD mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of SAL (5mg/kg) produced peak plasma concentrations at 6 hours. Chronic treatments of SCD mice with SAL mediated a 2.3-fold increase in F-cells (p=0.0013) and decreased sickle erythrocytes supporting in vivo HbF induction.",

As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population-genetic insights out-paced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous non-adaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model-fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Molting is a widespread developmental process in which the external extracellular matrix (ECM), the cuticle, is remodeled to allow for organismal growth and environmental adaptation. Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a diverse set of molting-associated factors including signaling molecules, intracellular trafficking regulators, ECM components, and ECM-modifying enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases. C. elegans NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, two conserved members of the NEK family of protein kinases, are essential for molting and promote the endocytosis of environmental steroid-hormone precursors by the epidermis. Steroids in turn drive the cyclic induction of many genes required for molting. Here we report a novel role for the sole C. elegans ADAM-meltrin metalloprotease family member, ADM-2, as a negative regulator of molting. Whereas loss of adm-2 led to strong suppression of molting defects in partial loss-of-function nekl mutants, overexpression of ADM-2 induced molting defects in wild-type animals. CRISPR genome editing implicated the Zn-binding motif within the metalloprotease domain as critical for mediating the effects of ADM-2 on molting. ADM-2 is expressed in the epidermis, and its trafficking through the endo-lysosomal network was disrupted after NEKL depletion. We also identified the epidermally expressed low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, LRP-1, as a candidate target of ADM-2 regulation. Whereas loss of ADM-2 activity led to the upregulation of LRP-1, ADM-2 overexpression caused a reduction in LRP-1 abundance, suggesting that ADM-2 may function as a sheddase for LRP-1. We propose that loss of adm-2 suppresses molting defects in nekl mutants by eliminating a negative regulator of LRP-1, thereby compensating for defects in the efficiency of LRP-1 and sterol uptake. Our findings emphasize the importance of endocytic trafficking for both the internalization of factors that promote molting and the removal of proteins that would otherwise be deleterious to the molting process.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe molecular and cellular features of molting in nematodes share many similarities with cellular and developmental processes that occur in mammals. This includes the degradation and reorganization of extracellular matrix materials that surround cells, as well as the intracellular machineries that allow cells to communicate and sample their environments. In the current study, we found an unexpected function for a conserved protein that degrades proteins on the external surface of cells. Rather than promoting molting through extracellular matrix reorganization, the ADM-2 protease can inhibit the molting process. This observation can be explained by data showing that ADM-2 negatively regulates LRP-1, a membrane protein that promotes molting by facilitating the uptake of molecular building blocks at the cell surface that are needed for molting-related signaling. Our data provide insights into the mechanisms controlling molting and link several conserved proteins to show how they function together during development.",

Existing approaches for detecting long-range interactions consist of propagating information from source nodes through cellular networks, but the selection of source nodes is inherently biased by prior knowledge. Here, we sought to derive an unbiased view of long-range interactions by adapting a perturbation-response scanning strategy initially developed for identifying allosteric interactions within proteins. We deployed this strategy onto an elastic network model of the yeast genetic network. The genetic network revealed a superior propensity for long-range interactions relative to simulated networks with similar topology. Long-range interactions were detected systematically throughout the network and found to be enriched in specific biological processes. Furthermore, perturbation-response scanning identified the major sources and receivers of information in the network, named effector and sensor genes, respectively. Effectors formed dense clusters centrally integrated into the network, whereas sensors formed loosely connected antenna-shaped clusters. Long-range interactions between effector and sensor clusters represent the major paths of information in the network.

These sequences were combined with 718 whole genome and 1,987 VP1-gene publicly available sequences.\n\nFindingsIn 2018, circulating strains clustered into multiple subgroups in the B3 and A2 subclades, with different phylogenetic origins. Clusters in subclade B3 emerged from strains circulating primarily in the US and Europe in 2016, though some had deeper roots linking to Asian strains, while clusters in A2 traced back to strains detected in East Asia in 2015-2016. In 2018, all sequences from the USA formed a distinct subgroup, containing only three non-US samples. Alongside the varied origins of seasonal strains, we found that diversification of these variants begins up to 18 months prior to the first diagnostic detection during a EV-D68 season. EV-D68 displays strong signs of continuous antigenic evolution and all 2018 A2 strains had novel patterns in the putative neutralizing epitopes in the BC- and DE-loops. The pattern in the BC-loop of the USA B3 subgroup had not been detected on that continent before. Patients with EV-D68 in subclade A2 were significantly older than patients with a B3 subclade virus. In contrast to other subclades, the age distribution of A2 is distinctly bimodal and was found primarily among children and in the elderly.\n\nInterpretationWe hypothesize that EV-D68s rapid evolution of surface proteins, extensive diversity, and high rate of geographic mixing could be explained by substantial reinfection of adults.\n\nFundingUniversity of Basel and Swedish Foundation for Research and Development in Medical Microbiology",

    "preprint_abstract": "Sprague Dawley (SD) rats are among the most widely used outbred laboratory rat populations. Despite this, the genetic characteristics of SD rats have not been clearly described, and SD rats are rarely used for experiments aimed at exploring genotype-phenotype relationships. In order to use SD rats to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we collected behavioral data from 4,625 SD rats that were predominantly obtained from two commercial vendors, Charles River Laboratories and Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc. Using double-digest genotyping-by-sequencing (ddGBS), we obtained dense, high-quality genotypes at 291,438 SNPs across 4,061 rats. This genetic data allowed us to characterize the variation present in Charles River vs. Harlan SD rats. We found that the two populations are highly diverged (FST > 0.4). Furthermore, even for rats obtained from the same vendor, there was strong population structure across breeding facilities and even between rooms at the same facility. We performed multiple separate GWAS by fitting a linear mixed model that accounted population structure and using meta-analysis to jointly analyze all cohorts. Our study examined Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) behavior, which assesses the propensity for rats to attribute incentive salience to reward-associated cues. We identified 46 significant associations for the various metrics used to define PavCA. The surprising degree of population structure among SD rats from different sources has important implications for their use in both genetic and non-genetic studies.\n\nAuthor SummaryOutbred Sprague Dawley rats are among the most commonly used rats for neuroscience, physiology and pharmacological research; in the year 2020, 4,188 publications contained the keyword \"Sprague Dawley\". Rats identified as \"Sprague Dawley\" are sold by several commercial vendors, including Charles River Laboratories and Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc. (now Envigo). Despite their widespread use, little is known about the genetic diversity of SD. We genotyped more than 4,000 SD rats, which we used for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to characterize genetic differences between SD rats from Charles River Laboratories and Harlan. Our analysis revealed extensive population structure both between and within vendors. The GWAS for Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) identified a number of genome-wide significant loci for that complex behavioral trait. Our results demonstrate that, despite sharing an identical name, SD rats that are obtained from different vendors are very different. Future studies should carefully define the exact source of SD rats being used and may exploit their genetic diversity for genetic studies of complex traits.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Research in human associated microbiomes often involves the analysis of taxonomic count tables generated via high-throughput sequencing. It is difficult to apply statistical tools as the data is high-dimensional, sparse, and compositional. An approachable way to alleviate high-dimensionality and sparsity is to aggregate variables into pre-defined sets. Set-based analysis is ubiquitous in the genomics literature, and has demonstrable impact in improving interpretability and power of downstream analysis. Unfortunately, there is a lack of sophisticated set-based analysis methods specific to microbiome taxonomic data, where current practice often employs abundance summation as a technique for aggregation. This approach prevents comparison across sets of different sizes, does not preserve inter-sample distances, and amplifies protocol bias. Here, we attempt to fill this gap with a new single sample taxon enrichment method that uses a novel log-ratio formulation based on the competitive null hypothesis commonly used in the enrichment analysis literature. Our approach, titled competitive balances for taxonomic enrichment analysis (CBEA), generates sample-specific enrichment scores as the scaled log ratio of the subcomposition defined by taxa within a set and the subcomposition defined by its complement. We provide sample-level significance testing by estimating an empirical null distribution of our test statistic with valid p-values. Herein we demonstrate using both real data applications and simulations that CBEA controls for type I error even under high sparsity and high inter-taxa correlation scenarios. Additionally, it provides informative scores that can be inputs to downstream analyses such as prediction tasks.\n\nAuthor summaryThe study of human associated microbiomes relies on genomic surveys via high-throughput sequencing. However, microbiome taxonomic data is sparse and high dimensional which prevents the application of standard statistical techniques. One approach to address this problem is to perform analyses at the level of taxon sets. Set-based analysis has a long history in the genomics literature, with demonstrable impact in improving both power and interpretability. Unfortunately, there is limited interest in developing new set-based tools tailored for microbiome taxonomic data given its unique features compared to other  omics data types. We developed a new tool to generate taxon set enrichment scores at the sample level through a novel log-ratio formulation based on the competitive null hypothesis. Our scores can be used for statistical inference at both the sample and population levels, as well as inputs to other downstream analyses such as prediction models. We demonstrate the performance of our method against competing approaches across both real data analyses and simulation studies.",

In ants and bees individual foragers have been observed to use negative pheromones or mechano-auditory signals to indicate that forage sources are not ideal, for example being unrewarded, crowded, or dangerous. Here we propose an additional function for negative feedback signals during foraging, variance reduction. We show that while on average populations will converge to desired distributions over forage patches both with and without negative feedback signals, in small populations negative feedback reduces variation around the target distribution compared to the use of positive feedback alone. Our results are independent of the nature of the target distribution, providing it can be achieved by foragers collecting only local information. Since robustness is a key aim for biological systems, and deviation from target foraging distributions may be costly, we argue that this could be a further important and hitherto overlooked reason that negative feedback signals are used by foraging social insects.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that reside in a bacterial host chromosome and are prominent drivers of bacterial evolution. They are also powerful tools for genetic analyses and engineering. Transfer of an ICE to a new host involves many steps, including excision from the chromosome, DNA processing and replication, transfer across the envelope of the donor and recipient, processing of the DNA, and eventual integration into the chromosome of the new host (now a stable transconjugant). Interactions between an ICE and its hosts throughout the life cycle likely influence the efficiencies of acquisition by new hosts. Here, we investigated how different functional modules of two ICEs, Tn916 and ICEBs1, affect the transfer efficiencies into different host bacteria. We constructed hybrid elements that utilize the high-efficiency regulatory and excision modules of ICEBs1 and the conjugation genes of Tn916. These elements produced more transconjugants than Tn916, likely due to increased excision frequencies. We also found that several Tn916 and ICEBs1 components can substitute for one other. Using B. subtilis donors and three Enterococcus species as recipients, we found that different hybrid elements were more readily acquired by some species than others, demonstrating species-specific interactions in steps of the ICE life cycle. This work demonstrates that hybrid elements utilizing the efficient regulatory functions of ICEBs1 can be built to enable efficient transfer into and engineering of a variety of other species.\n\nAuthor summary (non-technical)Horizontal gene transfer helps drive microbial evolution, enabling bacteria to rapidly acquire new genes and traits. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that reside in a bacterial host chromosome and are prominent drivers of horizontal gene transfer. They are also powerful tools for genetic analyses and engineering. Some ICEs carry genes that confer obvious properties to host bacteria, including antibiotic resistances, symbiosis, and pathogenesis. When activated, an ICE-encoded machine is made that can transfer the element to other cells, where it then integrates into the chromosome of the new host. Specific ICEs transfer more effectively into some bacterial species compared to others, yet little is known about the determinants of the efficiencies and specificity of acquisition by different bacterial species. We made and utilized hybrid ICEs, composed of parts of two different elements, to investigate determinants of transfer efficiencies. Our findings demonstrate that there are species-specific interactions that help determine efficiencies of stable acquisition, and that this explains, in part, the efficiencies of different ICEs. These hybrid elements are also useful in genetic engineering and synthetic biology to move genes and pathways into different bacterial species with greater efficiencies than can be achieved with naturally occurring ICEs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of severe diarrhea and diarrheal-related death in children worldwide. As an obligate intracellular parasite, Cryptosporidium relies on intestinal epithelial cells to provide a niche for its growth and survival, but little is known about the contributions that the infected cell makes to this relationship. Here we conducted a genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen to discover host genes required for Cryptosporidium parvum infection and/or host cell survival. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that the host interferon response, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis are important determinants of susceptibility to C. parvum infection. Several of these pathways are linked to parasite attachment and invasion and C-type lectins on the surface of the parasite. Evaluation of transcript and protein induction of innate interferons revealed a pronounced type III interferon response to Cryptosporidium in human cells as well as in mice. Treatment of mice with IFN{lambda} reduced infection burden and protected immunocompromised mice from severe outcomes including death, with effects that required STAT1 signaling in the enterocyte. Initiation of this type III interferon response was dependent on sustained intracellular growth and mediated by the pattern recognition receptor TLR3. We conclude that host cell intrinsic recognition of Cryptosporidium results in IFN{lambda} production critical to early protection against this infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryCryptosporidium infection is an important contributor to global childhood mortality. There are currently no vaccines available, and the only drug has limited efficacy in immunocompromised individuals and malnourished children who need it most. To discover which host proteins are essential for Cryptosporidium infection, we conducted a genome wide knockout screen in human host cells. Our results confirm the importance of glycosaminoglycans on the surface of epithelial cells for attachment and invasion of the parasite. We also found that host GPI anchor biosynthesis and interferon signaling pathways were enriched by our screen. Examining the role of interferon signaling further we found a type III interferon response, IFN{lambda}, was generated in response to infection and shown to be initiated in the infected cell. Utilizing mouse models of infection, we found that the type III interferon response was important early during infection with its induction likely preceding IFN{gamma}, a key cytokine for the control of this infection. We also determined that TLR3 was the pattern recognition receptor responsible for IFN{lambda} production during Cryptosporidium infection. Our work shows that IFN{lambda} acts directly on the enterocyte and its use in treating immunocompromised mice produced striking reductions in infection.",

Upon aerosol infection with RVFV, the brain is a major site of viral replication and tissue damage, yet pathogenesis in this organ has been understudied. Here, we investigated the immune response in the brain of RVFV infected mice. In response to infection, microglia initiate robust transcriptional upregulation of antiviral immune genes, as well as increased levels of activation markers and cytokine secretion that is dependent on mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and independent of toll-like receptors 3 and 7. In vivo, Mavs-/- mice displayed enhanced susceptibility to RVFV as determined by increased brain viral burden and higher mortality. Single-cell RNA sequence analysis identified microglia-specific defects in type I interferon and interferon responsive gene expression in Mavs-/- mice, as well as dysregulated lymphocyte infiltration. The results of this study provide a crucial step towards understanding the precise molecular mechanisms by which RVFV infection is controlled in the brain and will help inform the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies that are effective in preventing encephalitis.\n\nAuthor SummaryRift Valley fever virus causes severe disease in humans and livestock and in some cases can be fatal. There is concern about the use of Rift Valley fever virus as a bioweapon since it can be transmitted through the air, and there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments. Airborne transmission of the virus causes severe inflammation of the brain, yet little is known about the immune response against the virus in this organ. Here, we investigated the immune response in the brain to Rift Valley fever virus following intranasal infection. We determined that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, initiate a robust response to Rift Valley fever virus infection and identified a key immune pathway that is critical for the ability of microglia to respond to infection. When this immune pathway is rendered non-functional, mice have a dysregulated response to infection in the brain. This study provides insight into how the immune response can control Rift Valley fever virus infection of the brain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Macroscopic oscillations in the brain have been observed to be involved in many cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. One of the suggested functions of the oscillations is to dynamically modulate communication between neural circuits. The Communication Through Coherence (CTC) theory establishes that oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in excitability of the neuronal populations. Thus, populations need to be properly phase-locked so that input volleys arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population to communicate effectively. Here, we present a modeling study to explore synchronization between neuronal circuits connected with unidirectional projections. We consider an Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons modeling a Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma (PING) rhythm. The network receives an external periodic input from either one or two sources, simulating the inputs from other oscillating neural groups. We use recently developed mean-field models which provide an exact description of the macroscopic activity of the spiking network. This low-dimensional mean field model allows us to use tools from bifurcation theory to identify the phase-locked states between the input and the target population as a function of the amplitude, frequency and coherence of the inputs. We identify the conditions for optimal phaselocking and selective communication. We find that inputs with high coherence can entrain the network for a wider range of frequencies. Besides, faster oscillatory inputs than the intrinsic network gamma cycle show more effective communication than inputs with similar frequency. Our analysis further shows that the entrainment of the network by inputs with higher frequency is more robust to distractors, thus giving them an advantage to entrain the network. Finally, we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs in selective attention.\n\nAuthor summaryOscillations are ubiquitous in the brain and are involved in several cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. The Communication Through Coherence theory proposes that background oscillations in the brain regulate the information flow between neural populations. The oscillators that are properly phase-locked so that inputs arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population communicate effectively. In this paper, we study the emerging phase-locking patterns of a network generating PING oscillations under external periodic forcing, simulating the oscillatory input from other neural groups. We identify the conditions for optimal phase-locking and selective communication. Namely, we find that inputs with higher frequency and coherence have an adavantage to entrain the network and we quantify how robust are to distractors. Furthermore, we show how selective attention can be implemented by means of phase locking and we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs.",

However, so far, there does not exist a systematic evaluation of scenarios where classical ML methods (such as penalized logistic regression) already perform adequately for AIRR classification. This hinders investigative reorientation to those scenarios where further method development of more sophisticated ML approaches may be required.\n\nResultsTo identify those scenarios where a baseline method is able to perform well for AIRR classification, we generated a collection of synthetic benchmark datasets encompassing a wide range of dataset architecture-associated and immune state-associated sequence pattern (signal) complexity. We trained {approx}1300 ML models with varying assumptions regarding immune signal on{approx}850 datasets with a total of {approx}210000 repertoires containing {approx}42 billion TCR{beta} CDR3 amino acid sequences, thereby surpassing the sample sizes of current state-of-the-art AIRR ML setups by two orders of magnitude. We found that L1-penalized logistic regression achieved high prediction accuracy even when the immune signal occurs only in 1 out of 50000 AIR sequences.\n\nConclusionsWe provide a reference benchmark to guide new AIRR ML classification methodology by: (i) identifying those scenarios characterised by immune signal and dataset complexity, where baseline methods already achieve high prediction accuracy and (ii) facilitating realistic expectations of the performance of AIRR ML models given training dataset properties and assumptions.

This multisensory advantage might be driven by the integration of vision with either the haptic position only or with both position and size cues. To contrast these two hypotheses, we manipulated visual uncertainty (central vs. peripheral vision) and the availability of haptic cues during multisensory grasping. We showed a multisensory benefit irrespective of the degree of visual uncertainty suggesting that the integration process involved in multisensory grasping can be flexibly modulated by the contribution of each modality. Increasing visual uncertainty revealed the role of the distinct haptic cues. The haptic position cue was sufficient to promote multisensory benefits evidenced by faster actions with smaller grip apertures, whereas the haptic size was fundamental in fine-tuning the grip aperture scaling. These results support the hypothesis that, in multisensory grasping, vision is integrated with all haptic cues, with the haptic position cue playing the key part. Our findings highlight the important role of non-visual sensory inputs in sensorimotor control and hint at the potential contributions of the haptic modality in developing and maintaining visuomotor functions.",

Integration of sensory inputs has been traditionally studied using passive stimuli, segregating perception from action. Lessons learned from this approach, however, may not generalize to ethological behaviors like navigation, where there is an active interplay between perception and action. We designed a sensory-based sequential decision task in virtual reality in which humans and monkeys navigated to a memorized location by integrating optic flow generated by their own joystick movements. A major challenge in such closed-loop tasks is that subjects actions will determine future sensory input, causing ambiguity about whether they rely on sensory input rather than expectations based solely on a learned model of the dynamics. To test whether subjects performed sensory integration, we used three independent experimental manipulations: unpredictable optic flow perturbations, which pushed subjects off their trajectory; gain manipulation of the joystick controller, which changed the consequences of actions; and manipulation of the optic flow density, which changed the reliability of sensory evidence. Our results suggest that both macaques and humans relied heavily on optic flow, thereby demonstrating a critical role for sensory evidence accumulation during naturalistic action-perception closed-loop tasks.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Intracranial neurophysiological recordings require chronic implants to provide transcranial access to the brain. Especially in larger animals, which participate in experiments over extended periods of time, implants should match the skull curvature to promote osseointegration and avoid tissue and bacterial ingress over time. Proposed CAD methods for designing implants to date have focused on naive animals with continuous and even skull surfaces and calculate Boolean differences between implant and skull surface to fit the implant to the skull curvature. However, custom-fitting by calculating the difference fails, if a discontinuous skull surface needs to be matched. Also, the difference method does not allow designs with constant material thickness along the skull curvature, e.g. to allow fixed screw lengths. We present a universal step-by-step guide for custom-fitting implants which overcomes these limitations. It is suited for unusual skull conditions, like surface discontinuities or irregularities and includes virtual bending as a process to match skull surfaces while maintaining implant thickness. We demonstrate its applicability for a wide spectrum of scenarios, ranging from complex-shaped single-pieced implants to detailed multi-component implant systems built on even or discontinuous skull. The guide uses only a few software tools and the final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. A detailed description of this process is available on GitHub including step-by-step video instructions suitable for users without any prior knowledge in CAD programming. We report the experience with these implants over several years in 11 rhesus monkeys.\n\nSignificance StatementChronic implants are essential for intracranial neurophysiological recordings. In this study we show how to custom-design and -fit such implants for rhesus monkeys (Macacca mulatta). Different to existing approaches, our procedure is not limited to even skull surfaces but can be applied to discontinuous or irregular surfaces. It furthermore presents a description of virtual implant bending to match the skull curvature while maintaining implant thickness. The final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. In contrast to previous studies, this guide is suited for users without any prior expertise in CAD programming using our step-by-step video instructions.",

We probed this with direct intracranial recordings covering most of the left hemisphere in 46 humans as they read aloud regular, exception and pseudo-words. We used this to create a spatiotemporal map of word processing and to derive how broadband gamma activity varies with multiple word attributes critical to reading speed: lexicality, word frequency and orthographic neighborhood. We found that lexicality is encoded earliest in mid-fusiform (mFus) cortex and precentral sulcus, and is represented reliably enough to allow single-trial lexicality decoding. Word frequency is first represented in mFus and later in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while orthographic neighborhood sensitivity resides solely in IPS. We thus isolate the neural correlates of the distributed reading network involving mFus, IFG, IPS, precentral sulcus and motor cortex and provide direct evidence for dual-route models of reading, with parallel processes via the lexical route from mFus to IFG, and the sub-lexical route from IPS and precentral sulcus to anterior IFG.",

This work investigates the evolutionary relationships among these yeasts from a mitochondrial (mt) genomic perspective. A comparative study of 141 yeast mt genomes representing all major phylogenetic lineages of Saccharomycotina was performed, including genome size and content variability, intron and intergenic regions diversity, genetic code alterations and syntenic variation. Findings from this study suggest that mt genome size diversity is the result of a ceaseless random process mainly based on genetic recombination and intron mobility. Gene order analysis revealed conserved syntenic units and many occurring rearrangements, which can be correlated with major evolutionary events as shown by the phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated mt protein matrix. For the first time, molecular dating indicated a slower mt genome divergence rate in the early stages of yeast evolution, in contrast with a faster rate in the late evolutionary stages, compared to their nuclear time divergence. Genetic code reassignments of mt genomes are a perpetual process happening in many different parallel evolutionary steps throughout Saccharomycotina evolution. Overall, this work shows that phylogenetic studies that employ the mt genome of yeasts highlight major evolutionary events.",

Here, we have used a disease-relevant model system to investigate the biophysical properties of the RNA-binding protein HNRNPH1s interaction with G-rich sequences. We demonstrate the importance of two EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich regions in mediating the exclusion of this exon from the oncogenic EWS-FLI1 transcripts expressed in a subset of Ewing sarcomas, using complementary analysis of tumor data, long-read sequencing, and minigene studies. We determined that HNRNPH1 binds the EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich sequences with low nM affinities irrespective of whether in a non-G4 or G4 state but exhibits different kinetics depending on RNA structure. Specifically, HNRNPH1 associates and dissociates from G4-folded RNA faster than the identical sequences in a non-G4 state. Importantly, we demonstrate using gel shift and spectroscopic assays that HNRNPH1, particularly the qRRM1-qRRM2 domains, destabilizes the G4s formed by the EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich sequences in a non-catalytic fashion. Our results indicate that HNRNPH1s binding of G-rich sequences favors the accumulation of RNA in a non-G4 state and that this contributes to its regulation of RNA processing.",

Oxford nanopore sequencing records changes in electrical current when nucleic acid traverses through a pore. However, basecalling of this raw signal (known as a squiggle) is error prone, making it challenging to accurately identify splice junctions. Existing strategies include utilising matched short-read data and/or annotated splice junctions to correct nanopore reads but add expense or limit junctions to known (incomplete) annotations. Therefore, a method that could accurately identify splice junctions solely from nanopore data would have numerous advantages.\n\nResultsWe developed \"NanoSplicer\" to identify splice junctions using raw nanopore signal (squiggles). For each splice junction the observed squiggle is compared to candidate squiggles representing potential junctions to identify the correct candidate. Measuring squiggle similarity enables us to compute the probability of each candidate junction and find the most likely one. We tested our method using 1. synthetic mRNAs with known splice junctions 2. biological mRNAs from a lung-cancer cell-line. The results from both datasets demonstrate NanoSplicer improves splice junction identification, especially when the basecalling error rate near the splice junction is elevated. Our method is implemented in the software package NanoSplicer, available at https://github.com/shimlab/NanoSplicer.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Many studies have quantified the distribution of heterozygosity and relatedness in natural populations, but surprisingly few have examined the demographic processes driving these patterns. In this study we take a novel approach by studying how population structure affects both pairwise identity and the distribution of heterozygosity in a natural population of a self-incompatible plant Antirrhinum majus. We look at a measure of the variance in heterozygosity within a population, identity disequilibrium (g2), together with FST using a panel of 91 SNPs in 22,353 individuals collected over 11 years. We find that pairwise relatedness (FST) declines rapidly over short spatial scales, and the excess variance in heterozygosity between individuals (g2) reflects significant variation in inbreeding. Additionally, we detect an excess of individuals with around half the average heterozygosity, indicating that some are due to selfing or matings between close relatives. We use two types of simulation to ask whether variation in heterozygosity is consistent with fine-scale spatial population structure. First, by simulating offspring using parents drawn from a range of spatial scales, we show that the known pollen dispersal kernel explains g2. Second, we simulate a 1000-generation pedigree using the known dispersal and spatial distribution and find that the resulting g2 is consistent with that observed from the field data. In contrast, a simulated population with uniform density underestimates g2, indicating that heterogeneous density promotes identity disequilibrium. Our study shows that heterogeneous density and leptokurtic dispersal can together explain the distribution of heterozygosity. Furthermore, our study highlights the limitations of making theoretical predictions from simulations that only assume simple density and dispersal distributions.",

With a cyclic array of phosphate esters and diphosphate groups around myo-inositol, these molecular messengers possess the highest charge density found in nature. Recent work deciphering inositol pyrophosphate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis revealed important functions of these messengers in nutrient sensing, hormone signaling and plant immunity. However, despite the rapid hydrolysis of these molecules in plant extracts, very little is known about the molecular identity of the phosphohydrolases that convert these messengers back to their inositol polyphosphate precursors. Here, we investigate whether Arabidopsis Plant and Fungi Atypical Dual Specificity Phosphatases (PFA-DSP1-5) catalyze inositol pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase activity. We find that recombinant proteins of all five Arabidopsis PFA-DSP homologs display phosphohydrolase activity with a high specificity for the 5-{beta}-phosphate of inositol pyrophosphates. We further show that heterologous expression of Arabidopsis PFA-DSP1-5 rescues wortmannin-sensitivity and deranged inositol pyrophosphate homeostasis caused by the deficiency of the PFA-DSP-type inositol pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase Siw14 in yeast. Heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves provided evidence that Arabidopsis PFA-DSP1 also displays 5-{beta}-phosphate specific inositol pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase activity in planta. Our findings lay the biochemical basis and provide the genetic tools to uncover the roles of inositol pyrophosphates in plant physiology and plant development.",

Several functional-anatomical models of critical neural substrates of receptive speech have been proposed, including (1) auditory-related regions in the left mid-posterior superior temporal lobe, (2) motor-related regions in the left frontal lobe (in normal and/or noisy conditions), the left anterior superior temporal lobe, or (4) bilateral mid-posterior superior temporal areas. One difficulty in comparing these models is that they often focus on different aspects of the sound-to-meaning pathway and are supported by different types of stimuli and tasks. Two auditory tasks that are typically used in separate studies--syllable discrimination and word comprehension--often yield different conclusions. We assessed syllable discrimination (words and nonwords) and word comprehension (clear speech and with a noise masker) in 158 individuals with focal brain damage: left (n=113) or right (n=19) hemisphere stroke, left (n=18) or right (n=8) anterior temporal lobectomy, and 26 neurologically-intact controls. Discrimination and comprehension tasks are doubly dissociable both behaviorally and neurologically. In support of a bilateral model, clear speech comprehension was near ceiling in 95% of left stroke cases and right temporal damage impaired syllable discrimination. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses for the syllable discrimination and noisy word comprehension tasks each implicated most of the left superior temporal gyrus (STG). Comprehension but not discrimination tasks also implicated the left pMTG, while discrimination but not comprehension tasks also implicated more dorsal sensorimotor regions in posterior perisylvian cortex.",

However, to date, this relationship has been investigated primarily with face and image stimuli; considerably less is known about the oscillatory correlates of complex rule learning, as in language. Further, recent work has shown that non-oscillatory (1/f) activity is functionally relevant to cognition, yet its interaction with oscillatory activity during complex rule learning remains unknown. Using spectral decomposition and power-law exponent estimation of human EEG data (17 females, 18 males), we show for the first time that 1/f and oscillatory activity jointly influence the learning of word order rules of a miniature artificial language system. Flexible word order rules were associated with a steeper 1/f slope, while fixed word order rules were associated with a shallower slope. We also show that increased theta and alpha power predicts fixed relative to flexible word order rule learning and behavioural performance. Together, these results suggest that 1/f activity plays an important role in higher-order cognition, including language processing, and that grammar learning is modulated by different word order permutations, which manifest in distinct oscillatory profiles.",

The majority of existing methods provide a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients. However, since mutation profiles of patients from the same cancer type show a high degree of heterogeneity, a more ideal approach is to identify patient-specific drivers.\n\nResultsWe propose a novel method that integrates genomic data, biological pathways, and protein connectivity information for personalized identification of driver genes. The method is formulated on a personalized bipartite graph for each patient. Our approach provides a personalized ranking of the mutated genes of a patient based on the sum of weighted  pairwise pathway coverage scores across all the patients, where appropriate pairwise patient similarity scores are used as weights to normalize these coverage scores. We compare our method against three state-of-the-art patient-specific cancer gene prioritization methods. The comparisons are with respect to a novel evaluation method that takes into account the personalized nature of the problem. We show that our approach outperforms the existing alternatives for both the TCGA and the cell-line data. Additionally, we show that the KEGG/Reactome pathways enriched in our ranked genes and those that are enriched in cell lines reference sets overlap significantly when compared to the overlaps achieved by the rankings of the alternative methods.

    "preprint_abstract": "Sample normalization is a critical step in metabolomics to remove differences in total sample amount or concentration of metabolites between biological samples. Here, we present MAFFIN, an accurate and robust post-acquisition sample normalization workflow that works universally for metabolomics data collected by mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms. The most important design of MAFFIN is the calculation of normalization factor using maximal density fold change (MDFC) value computed by a kernel density-based approach. MDFC is more accurate than traditional median FC-based normalization, especially when the numbers of up- and down-regulated metabolic features are different. In addition, we showcase two essential steps that are overlooked by conventional normalization methods, and incorporated them into MAFFIN. First, instead of using all detected metabolic features, MAFFIN automatically extracts and uses only the high-quality features to calculate FCs and determine the normalization factor. In particular, multiple orthogonal criteria are proposed to pick up the high-quality features. Second, to guarantee the accuracy of the FCs, the MS signal intensities of the high-quality features are corrected using serial quality control (QC) samples. Using simulated data and urine metabolomics datasets, we demonstrated the critical need of high-quality feature selection, MS signal correction, and MDFC. We also show the superior performance of MAFFIN over other commonly used post-acquisition sample normalization methods. Finally, a biological application on a human saliva metabolomics study shows that MAFFIN provides robust sample normalization, leading to better data separation in principal component analysis (PCA) and the identification of more significantly altered metabolic features.\n\nTOC O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "preprint_abstract": "Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) platforms have become increasingly popular for studying complex single-cell biology in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of cancer subjects. Studying the intensity of the proteins that regulate important cell-functions, often known as functional markers, in the TME becomes extremely crucial for subject-specific assessment of risks, such as risk of recurrence and risk of death. The conventional approach requires selection of two thresholds, one to define the cells of the TME as positive or negative for a particular functional marker, and the other to classify the subjects based on the proportion of the positive cells. The selection of the thresholds has a large impact on the results and an arbitrary selection can lead to an incomprehensible conclusion. In light of this problem, we present a threshold-free distance between the subjects based on the probability densities of the functional markers. The distance can be used to classify the subjects into meaningful groups or can be used in a linear mixed model setup for testing association with clinical outcomes. The method gets rid of the subjectivity bias of the thresholding-based approach, enabling an easier but interpretable analysis of these types of data. With the proposed method, we analyze a lung cancer dataset from an mIHC platform, finding the difference in the density of functional marker HLA-DR to be significantly associated with the overall survival. The approach is also applied on an MIBI triple-negative breast cancer dataset to analyze effects of multiple functional markers. Finally, we demonstrate the reliability of our method through extensive simulation studies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Predicting a multicellular organisms phenotype quantitatively from its genotype is challenging, as genetic effects must propagate across scales. Circadian clocks are intracellular regulators that control temporal gene expression patterns and hence metabolism, physiology and behaviour. Here we explain and predict canonical phenotypes of circadian timing in a multicellular, model organism. We used diverse metabolic and physiological data to combine and extend mathematical models of rhythmic gene expression, photoperiod-dependent flowering, elongation growth and starch metabolism within a Framework Model for the vegetative growth of Arabidopsis thaliana, sharing the model and data files in a structured, public resource. The calibrated model predicted the effect of altered circadian timing upon each particular phenotype in clock-mutant plants under standard laboratory conditions. Altered night-time metabolism of stored starch accounted for most of the decrease in whole-plant biomass, as previously proposed. Mobilisation of a secondary store of malate and fumarate was also mis-regulated, accounting for any remaining biomass defect. We test three candidate mechanisms for the accumulation of these organic acids. Our results link genotype through specific processes to higher-level phenotypes, formalising our understanding of a subtle, pleiotropic syndrome at the whole-organism level, and validating the systems approach to understand complex traits starting from intracellular circuits.\n\nThis work updates the first biorXiv version, February 2017, https://doi.org/10.1101/105437, with an expanded description and additional analysis of the same core data sets and the same FMv2 model, summary tables and supporting, follow-on data from three further studies with further collaborators.

The subcellular targets for the majority of these effectors remain unknown. Here, we show that Xanthomonas campestris, the causal agent of black rot disease, delivers the highly conserved effector XopP that interacts with hosts EXO70 protein. EXO70 is an essential component of the exocyst complex with a role in plant immunity. The XopP/EXO70 interaction is specific and inhibits exocyst-dependent exocytosis without activating a specific plant NLR receptor that guards EXO70. In this way, Xanthomonas efficiently inhibits the hosts PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) by blocking exocytosis of PR1, callose deposition and the FLS2 immunity-receptor translocation to the plasma membrane, promoting successful infection.",

Given that this expands the repertoire of small RNAs capable of post-transcriptional gene expression, it is important to predict tRF targets with confidence. Some attempts have been made to predict tRF targets, but are limited in the scope of tRF classes used in prediction or limited in feature selection. We hypothesized that established miRNA target prediction features applied to tRFs through a random forest machine learning algorithm will immensely improve tRF target prediction. Using this approach, we show significant improvements in tRF target prediction for all classes of tRFs and validate our predictions in two independent cell lines. Finally, Gene Ontology analysis suggests that among the tRFs conserved between mice and humans, the predicted targets are enriched significantly in neuronal function, and we show this specifically for tRF-3009a. These improvements to tRF target prediction further our understanding of tRF function broadly across species and provide avenues for testing novel roles for tRFs in biology.

How piRNAs faithfully discriminate between self and non-self to restrict all mobile elements while sparing essential genes remains a key outstanding question in genome biology. PiRNAs use extensive base-pairing to recognize their targets and variable 3ends could change the specificity and efficacy of piRNA silencing. Here, we identify conserved rules that ensure the generation of a single major piRNA 3end in flies and mice. Our data suggest that the PIWI proteins initially define a short interval on pre-piRNAs that grants access to the ZUC-processor complex. Within this Goldilocks zone, the preference of the ZUC-processor to cut in front of a Uridine determines the ultimate processing site. We observe a mouse-specific roadblock that relocates the Goldilocks zone and generates an opportunity for consecutive trimming by PNLDC1. Our data reveal a conserved hierarchy between length and sequence preferences that controls the piRNA sequence space. The unanticipated precision of 3end formation bolsters the emerging understanding that the functional piRNA sequence space is tightly controlled to ensure effective defense.\n\nKey findingsO_LIEvery piRNA has a single major 3end\nC_LIO_LILength preference trumps sequence preference during 3end formation.\nC_LIO_LIRelocation of the Goldilocks zone generates opportunity for trimming of mouse piRNAs.\nC_LI",

Its performance is crucial for the holistic detection of all metabolic features as well as their relative quantification for statistical analysis and metabolite identification. Random noise, non-baseline separated compounds and unspecific background signals complicate this task.\n\nResultsA machine-learning framework entitled PeakBot was developed for detecting chromatographic peaks in LC-HRMS profile-mode data. It first detects all local signal maxima in a chromatogram, which are then extracted as super-sampled standardized areas (retention-time vs. m/z). These are subsequently inspected by a custom-trained convolutional neural network that forms the basis of PeakBots architecture. The model reports if the respective local maximum is the apex of a chromatographic peak or not as well as its peak center and bounding box.\n\nIn training and independent validation datasets used for development, PeakBot achieved a high performance with respect to discriminating between chromatographic peaks and background signals (accuracy of 0.99). For training the machine-learning model a minimum of 100 reference features are needed to learn their characteristics to achieve high-quality peak-picking results for detecting such chromatographic peaks in an untargeted fashion.\n\nPeakBot is implemented in python (3.8) and uses the TensorFlow (2.5.0) package for machine-learning related tasks. It has been tested on Linux and Windows OSs.\n\nAvailabilityThe package is available free of charge for non-commercial use (CC BY-NC-SA).

Many of the proteins in vertebrate egg coats contain copies (1-6) of the ZP-N domain. These ZP-N domains can facilitate multiple reproduction functions, including species-specific sperm recognition. We integrated phylogenetics and machine learning to investigate how ZP-N domains diversified in structure and function. The most C-terminal ZP-N domain of each paralog is associated with another domain type (ZP-C) which together form a \"ZP module.\" All modular ZP-N domains were phylogenetically distinct from non-modular or free ZP-N domains. Machine learning-based classification identified 8 residues that form a stabilizing network in modular ZP-N domains that is absent in free domains. Positive selection was identified in some free ZP-N domains. Our findings suggest that purifying selection has conserved an essential structural core in modular ZP-N domains, while free N-terminal domains have been able to experience functionally diversify.",

In bacteria, differences in gene distributions among individuals largely result from mobile elements that acquire and disperse accessory genes as cargo. In contrast, the impact of cargo-carrying elements on eukaryotic evolution remains largely unknown. Here, we show that variation in genome content within multiple fungal species is facilitated by Starships, a novel group of massive mobile elements that are 110 kb long on average, share conserved components, and carry diverse arrays of accessory genes. We identified hundreds of Starship-like regions across every major class of filamentous Ascomycetes, including 28 distinct Starships that range from 27-393 kb and last shared a common ancestor ca. 400 mya. Using new long-read assemblies of the plant pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, we characterize 4 additional Starships whose past and ongoing activities contribute to standing variation in genome structure and content. One of these elements, Voyager, inserts into 5S rDNA and contains a candidate virulence factor whose increasing copy number has contrasting associations with pathogenic and saprophytic growth, suggesting Voyagers activity underlies an ecological trade-off. We propose that Starships are eukaryotic analogs of bacterial integrative and conjugative elements based on parallels between their conserved components and may therefore represent the first known agents of active gene transfer in eukaryotes. Our results suggest that Starships have shaped the content and structure of fungal genomes for millions of years and reveal a new concerted route for evolution throughout an entire eukaryotic phylum.",

It is known that the application of osmotic stress to lipid vesicles causes a decrease in Laurdans generalized polarization (GP), which has been interpreted as an indication of membrane stretching. In cells, we see the opposite effects, as GP increases when the osmolarity of the solution is decreased. This increase in GP is associated with the presence of caveolae, which are known to disassemble and flatten in response to osmotic stress, in a process that supplies extra plasma membrane in physiological processes.\n\nSignificanceCells can experience multiple stresses in vivo. Furthermore, the application of osmotic stress is used as a biophysical tool to interrogate membrane proocesses in vitro. We sought to investigate the consequences of osmotic stress on the plasma membrane properties using the fluorescent probe Laurdan. Unexpectedly, we find that osmotic stress leads to an increase in GP in live cells. The opposite change in GP has been observed in model lipid bilayers, reminding us there are limitations to the utility of model systems in understanding cell membrane behavior.

We also calculated the free energy of PIP2 binding relative to other anionic phospholipids in both conformational states using potential of mean force (PMF) and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. Our results identify state-dependent binding of PIP2 to sites involving the proximal C-terminus and we show that PIP2 promotes a conformational transition from a down state towards an intermediate that resembles the up state.

While experimental and computational techniques have provided many insights into the properties of chelated ions, less is known about the energetic contributions of diffuse ions to large-scale conformational rearrangements. To address this, we present a model that is designed to quantify the influence of diffuse monovalent and divalent ions on the dynamics of biomolecular assemblies. This model employs all-atom (non-H) resolution and explicit ions, where effective potentials account for hydration effects. We first show that the model accurately predicts the number of excess Mg2+ ions for prototypical RNA systems, at a level comparable to modern coarse-grained models. We then apply the model to a complete ribosome and show how the balance between diffuse Mg2+ and K+ ions can control the dynamics of tRNA molecules during translation. The model predicts differential effects of diffuse ions on the free-energy barrier associated with tRNA entry and the energy of tRNA binding to the ribosome. Together, this analysis reveals the direct impact of diffuse ions on the dynamics of an RNP assembly.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/448160v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f36caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1963073org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@146fbf8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14860ab_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The new photoswitchable ligands produced photocurrents in untransfected neurons upon covalently tethering to endogenous glutamate receptors and activating them reversibly with visible light pulses of few milliseconds. As a proof of concept of these molecular prostheses, we apply them to the ultrafast synapses of auditory neurons of the cochlea that encode sound and provide auditory input to the brain.

However, microbiota assembly mechanisms underlying CyanoHABs remain scenario specific and elusive. Especially, cyanopeptides, as a group of bioactive secondary metabolites of cyanobacteria, could affect microbiota assembly and ecosystem function. Here, the trajectory of cyanopeptides were followed and linked to microbiota during Microcystis-dominated CyanoHABs in lake Taihu, China. The most abundant cyanopeptide classes detected included microginin, spumigin, microcystin, nodularin and cyanopeptolin with total MC-LR-equivalent concentrations between 0.23 and 2051.54 ppb, of which cyanotoxins beyond microcystins (e.g., cyanostatin B and nodularin_R etc.) far exceeded reported organismal IC50 and negatively correlated with microbiota diversity, exerting potential collective eco-toxicities stronger than microcystins alone. The microbial communities were differentiated by size fraction and sampling date throughout CyanoHABs, and surprisingly, their variances were better explained by cyanopeptides (19-38%) than nutrients (0-16%). Cyanopeptides restriction (e.g., inhibition) and degradation are first quantitatively verified as the deterministic drivers governing community assembly, with stochastic processes being mediated by interplay between cyanopeptide dynamics and lake microbiota. This study presents an emerging paradigm in which cyanopeptides restriction and degradation co-mediate lake water microbiota assembly, unveiling new insights about the ecotoxicological significance of CyanoHABs to freshwater ecosystems.",

However, most of this surge was based on computational analysis of somatic mutation frequencies and/or their impact on the protein function. On the contrary, experimental research necessarily accounted for functional context of mutations interacting with other genes and conferring cancer phenotypes. Eventually, just such results become \"hard currency\" of cancer biology. The new method, NEAdriver employs knowledge accumulated thus far in the form of gene interaction networks and functionally annotated pathways in order to recover known and predict novel driver genes. The driver discovery was individualized by accounting for mutations co-occurrence in tumour genomes. For each somatic genome change, probabilistic estimates from two lanes of network analysis were combined into joint likelihoods of being a driver. Thus, ability to detect previously unnoticed candidate driver events emerged from combining individual genomic context with network perspective. The procedure was applied to ten largest cancer cohorts followed by evaluating error rates against previous cancer gene sets. The discovered driver combinations were shown to be informative on cancer outcome. We demonstrate that the individualized discovery revealed driver events which were individually rare, not detectable by other computational approaches, and related to cancer biology domains poorly covered by previous analyses. Considering the novel driver candidates and their constellations in individual tumor genomes opens a novel avenue for personalized cancer medicine.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Humans observe actions performed by others in many different visual and social settings. What features do we extract and attend when we view such complex scenes, and how are they processed in the brain? To answer these questions, we curated two large-scale sets of naturalistic videos of everyday actions and estimated their perceived similarity in two behavioral experiments. We normed and quantified a large range of visual, action-related and social-affective features across the stimulus sets. Using a cross-validated variance partitioning analysis, we found that social-affective features predicted similarity judgments better than, and independently of, visual and action features in both behavioral experiments. Next, we conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, which revealed a sustained correlation between neural responses to videos and their behavioral similarity. Visual, action, and social-affective features predicted neural patterns at early, intermediate and late stages respectively during this behaviorally relevant time window. Together, these findings show that social-affective features are important for perceiving naturalistic actions, and are extracted at the final stage of a temporal gradient in the brain.",

Cohesin extrudes DNA into loops that are thought to lengthen until CTCF boundaries are encountered. Little is known about whether loop extrusion is impeded by DNA-bound macromolecular machines. We demonstrate that the replicative helicase MCM is a barrier that restricts loop extrusion in G1 phase. Single-nucleus Hi-C of one-cell embryos revealed that MCM loading reduces CTCF-anchored loops and decreases TAD boundary insulation, suggesting loop extrusion is impeded before reaching CTCF. Single-molecule imaging shows that MCMs are physical barriers that frequently constrain cohesin translocation in vitro. Simulations are consistent with MCMs as abundant, random barriers. We conclude that distinct loop extrusion barriers contribute to shaping 3D genomes.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMCM complexes are obstacles that impede the formation of CTCF-anchored loops.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Despite recent success in vaccinating populations against SARS-CoV-2, concerns about immunity duration, continued efficacy against emerging variants, protection from infection and transmission, and worldwide vaccine availability, remain. Although mRNA, pDNA, and viral-vector based vaccines are being administered, no protein subunit-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is approved. Molecular adjuvants targeting pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) could improve and broaden the efficacy and durability of vaccine responses. Native SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulate various PRRs, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic-acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RIG-I). We hypothesized that targeting the same PRRs using adjuvants on nanoparticles along with a stabilized spike (S) protein antigen could provide broad and efficient immune responses. Formulations targeting TLR4 (MPLA), TLR7/8 (R848), TLR9 (CpG), and RIG-I (PUUC) delivered on degradable polymer-nanoparticles (NPs) were combined with the S1 subunit of S protein and assessed in vitro with isogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions (iso-MLRs). For in vivo studies, the adjuvanted nanoparticles were combined with stabilized S protein and assessed using intranasal and intramuscular prime-boost vaccination models in mice. Combination NP-adjuvants targeting both TLR and RIG-I (MPLA+PUUC, CpG+PUUC, or R848+PUUC) differentially increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-1{beta}, IL-12p70, IL-27, IFN-{beta}) by APCs cultured in vitro, and induced differential T cell proliferation. When delivered intranasally, MPLA+PUUC NPs enhanced local CD4+CD44+ activated memory T cell responses while MPLA NPs increased anti-S-protein-specific IgG and IgA in the lung. Following intramuscular delivery, PUUC-carrying NPs induced strong humoral immune responses, characterized by increases in anti-S-protein IgG and neutralizing antibody titers and germinal center B cell populations (GL7+ and BCL6+ B cells). MPLA+PUUC NPs further boosted S-protein-neutralizing antibody titers and T follicular helper cell populations in draining lymph nodes. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2-mimicking adjuvants and subunit vaccines could lead to robust and unique route-specific adaptive immune responses and may provide additional tools against the pandemic.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=58 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478507v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b8174org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@701721org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@feb860org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fae094_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Integrative analysis of single-cell assays for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) suggested the presence of proliferating mTECs with a specific chromatin structure, which express high levels of Aire and co-stimulatory molecules CD80 (Aire+CD80hi). Proliferating Aire+CD80hi mTECs detected by using Fucci technology express a minimal level of Aire-dependent TSAs and are converted into quiescent Aire+CD80hi mTECs expressing high levels of TSAs after a transit amplification.

The biophysical characteristic of Kv channels can be matched to the needs of different neurons by forming homotetrameric or heterotetrameric channels within one of four subfamilies. The cytoplasmic tetramerization (T1) domain plays a major role in dictating the compatibility of different Kv subunits. The only Kv subfamily missing a representative structure of the T1 domain is the Kv2 family. We used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the human Kv2.1 T1 domain. The structure is similar to other T1 domains but surprisingly formed a pentamer instead of a tetramer. In solution the Kv2.1 T1 domain also formed a pentamer as determined with in-line SEC-MALS-SAXS and negative stain EM. The Kv2.1 T1-T1 interface involves electrostatic interactions including a salt bridge formed by the negative charges in a previously described CDD motif, and inter-subunit coordination of zinc. We show that zinc binding is important for stability. In conclusion, the Kv2.1 T1 domain behaves differently from the other Kv T1 domains which may reflect the versatility of Kv2.1, the only Kv subfamily that can assemble with the regulatory KvS subunits and scaffold ER-plasma membrane contacts.",

Marine plastics are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria, including human pathogens, posing potential risks to human health. Here, we investigate the effect of polymer type, residence time and estuarine location on bacterial colonisation of common household plastics, including pathogenic bacteria. To do so, we submerged five main household plastic types: low-density PE (LDPE), high-density PE (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at an estuarine site in Cornwall (U.K.) and tracked bacterial colonisation dynamics. Using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, we found that bacteria rapidly colonised plastics irrespective of polymer type. While biofilm community composition changed with colonisation time, no difference was observed between polymer types. Likewise, the presence of pathogenic bacteria, quantified using the insect model Galleria mellonella, increased over a five-week period, with no consistent differences observed between polymer types. Pathogens isolated from plastic biofilms using Galleria enrichment included Serratia and Enterococcus species and harboured a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes. Our findings show that plastics in coastal waters are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria, including known human pathogens, independent of polymer type.",

In most laboratory situations, movement errors have no physical consequences and simply indicate the progress of learning. Here we asked how experiencing a physical consequence when making a movement error affects motor learning. Two groups of participants adapted to a new, prism-induced mapping between visual input and motor output while performing a precision walking task. Importantly, one group experienced an unexpected slip perturbation when making foot-placement errors during adaptation. Because of our innate drive for safety, and the fact that balance is fundamental to movement, we hypothesized that this experience would enhance motor memory. Learning generalized to different walking tasks to a greater extent in the group who experienced the adverse physical consequence. This group also showed faster relearning one week later despite exposure to a competing mapping during initial learning--evidence of greater memory consolidation. The group differences in generalization and consolidation occurred even though they both experienced similar magnitude foot-placement errors and adapted at similar rates. Our results suggest the brain considers the potential physical consequences of movement error when learning and that balance-threatening consequences serve to enhance this process.",

This requires statistical methods to infer unknown model parameters from dynamic, multi-individual data accounting for heterogeneity caused by both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Here we present PEPSDI, a scalable and flexible framework for Bayesian inference in state-space mixed-effects stochastic dynamic single-cell models. Unlike previous frameworks, PEPSDI imposes a few modelling assumptions when inferring unknown model parameters from time-lapse data. Specifically, it can infer model parameters when intrinsic noise is modelled by either exact or approximate stochastic simulators, and when extrinsic noise is modelled by either time-varying, or time-constant parameters that vary between cells. This allowed us to identify hexokinase activity as a source of extrinsic noise, and to deduce that sugar availability dictates cell-to-cell variability in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF1 nutrient sensing pathway.",

    "preprint_abstract": "We present a simple model which can account for the stereoscopic sensitivity of praying mantis predatory strikes. The model consists of a single \"disparity sensor\": a binocular neuron sensitive to stereoscopic disparity and thus to distance from the animal. The model is based closely on the known behavioural and neurophysiological properties of mantis stereopsis. The monocular inputs to the neuron reflect temporal change and are insensitive to contrast sign, making the sensor insensitive to interocular correlation. The monocular receptive fields have a excitatory centre and inhibitory surround, making them tuned to size. The disparity sensor combines inputs from the two eyes linearly, applies a threshold and then an exponent output nonlinearity. The activity of the sensor represents the model mantiss instantaneous probability of striking. We integrate this over the stimulus duration to obtain the expected number of strikes in response to moving targets with different stereoscopic distance, size and vertical disparity. We optimised the parameters of the model so as to bring its predictions into agreement with our empirical data on mean strike rate as a function of stimulus size and distance. The model proves capable of reproducing the relatively broad tuning to size and narrow tuning to stereoscopic distance seen in mantis striking behaviour. The model also displays realistic responses to vertical disparity. Most surprisingly, although the model has only a single centre-surround receptive field in each eye, it displays qualitatively the same interaction between size and distance as we observed in real mantids: the preferred size increases as prey distance increases beyond the preferred distance. We show that this occurs because of a stereoscopic \"false match\" between the leading edge of the stimulus in one eye and its trailing edge in the other; further work will be required to find whether such false matches occur in real mantises. This is the first image-computable model of insect stereopsis, and reproduces key features of both neurophysiology and striking behaviour.",

We show that a federated trained model to segment interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) using datasets from three institutions is comparable to a model trained by pooling the data on one server when tested on a fourth (holdout) institutions data.

One of the most important and highly interested tool of GSP is graph Fourier transform (GFT) by which brain signals can be analyzed in different graph frequency bands. In this paper, the resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) data is analyzed using GFT tool in order to discover new knowledge about the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and find features discriminating between ASD and typically control (TC) subjects. For ASD group, the signal concentration in both low and high frequency bands is decreased by increasing the age in most of the brain well-known networks. The ASD in comparison to TC shows less intention for changing the signal concentration level when the level is very low or very high. In graph low frequency band, increasing the age is along with increasing the segregation and integration of brain ROIs respectively for ASD and TC. Also, in this band, the brain ROIs integration of ASD is more than TC. By increasing the age, the auditory network of ASD subjects shows increasing segregation and integration in graph low and high frequency bands, respectively. The reduced segregation of default mode network in ASD is happened in graph middle and higher frequency bands. The functional connectivity analysis between low and high frequency signals shows that some of the high frequency ROIs have connections with all low frequency ROIs so that the most of these connections are dramatically and significantly different between ASD and TC. By analyzing the local vertex frequency spectrum (LVFS) of ASD and TC at different states, it is seen these groups show contradictory behaviors with respect to each other in brain default mode network in two states. The results of different scenarios at different graph frequency bands demonstrate that using functional and structural data together can provide powerful tool for recognizing the ASD or even other brain disorders.",

We found that 62% of the participants could be identified based on the congruence of the later structural connectome to the initial connectivity matrix derived from the earlier timepoint. In contrast, similarity between functional connectomes only allowed to identify 12% of the participants. These suggests that structural connectivity is more stable in early life and can represent a potential connectome fingerprint. Thus, a relatively stable structural connectome appears to support a changing functional connectome at a time when neonates must rapidly acquire new skills to adapt to their new environment.",

While E-cadherin has been shown to be a mechanosensor, it is unknown if E-cadherin adhesions can differentially sense stiffness within the range of that of epithelial cells. A survey of literature shows that epithelial cells Youngs moduli of elasticity lie predominantly in the sub kPa to few kPa range, with cancer cells often being softer than non-cancerous ones. Here, we devised oriented E-cadherin-coated soft silicone substrates with sub kPa or few kPa elasticity, but with similar viscous moduli, and found that E-cadherin adhesions differentially organize depending on the magnitude of epithelial cell-like elasticity. Linearly shaped E-cadherin adhesions associated with radially oriented actin, but not irregularly shaped E-cadherin adhesions associated with circumferential actin foci, were much more numerous on 2.4 kPa E-cadherin substrates compared to 0.3 kPa E-cadherin substrates. However, the total amount of E-cadherin in both types of adhesions taken together was similar on the 0.3 kPa and 2.4 kPa E-cadherin substrates, across many cells. Furthermore, while the average extent of nuclear recruitment of the mechanoresponsive transcription factor YAP on the 0.3 kPa E-cadherin substrate was undiminished relative to that on the 2.4 kPa substrate, a fraction of cells on the softer substrate displayed relatively high levels of YAP nuclear recruitment. Our results show that E-cadherin adhesions can be regulated by epithelial cell-like elasticity and have significant implications for disease states like carcinomas characterized by altered epithelial cell elasticity.",

This influence has changed significantly in recent decades, with a general shift from free-range grazing to the penning of animals. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) proposes that perturbation - including anthropogenic disturbance - is the \"norm\" for ecosystems, and Mediterranean systems in particular, and that higher species diversity is found under conditions of continuous, low-level perturbation. We used Cyprus as a case study with the aim of assessing the impact of changes in grazing practice on biodiversity, while also taking account of other anthropogenic factors, such as fire. We aimed to test the IDH as it relates to grazing of scrub and open forest habitats in Cyprus, in the context of the general shift away from free-range grazing. Our hypothesis was that a greater diversity of breeding birds and plants would be found at sites subject to continuous low-level grazing perturbation over a long period of time, compared to sites where grazing has recently ceased, overgrazed sites and sites that have never been grazed.\n\nWe carried out surveys of breeding birds and vegetation at 48 study sites in scrub and open woodland across Cyprus. We estimated relative grazing pressure (past and present) and fire history at these sites, and looked for associations between these factors and birds, and perennial vegetation.\n\nOur findings showed the importance of anthropogenic disturbance for biodiversity in scrub and open forest habitats in Cyprus. However, our results relating to the influence of fire and grazing on birds and vegetation suggest that it is not a regime of continuous low-level disturbance, but rather the absence of perturbation - or at least only very low-level perturbation - that benefits biodiversity in these habitats in Cyprus. This suggests the best approach for biodiversity management in scrub and open woodland habitats in Cyprus is to keep grazing to a minimum and avoid fires, though a  no grazing approach should also be avoided, because absence of grazers would likely increase fire risk.",

However, RNA- seq and whole genome sequencing data contain not only reads from host tumor and normal tissue, but also reads from the tumor microbiome, which can be used to infer the microbial abundances in each tumor. Here, we show that tumor microbial abundances, alone or in combination with tumor gene expression data, can predict cancer prognosis and drug response to some extent - microbial abundances are significantly less predictive of prognosis than gene expression, although remarkably, similarly as predictive of drug response, but in mostly different cancer-drug combinations. Thus, it appears possible to leverage existing sequencing technology, or develop new protocols, to obtain more non-redundant information about prognosis and drug response from RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing experiments than could be obtained from tumor gene expression or genomic data alone.",

Because cancer therapeutics often target synthesis of DNA building blocks, DNA replication or DNA repair, we hypothesized that mutational signatures would make useful markers of drug sensitivity. We rigorously tested this hypothesis by a global analysis of various drug screening and genetic screening data sets, derived from cancer cell line panels. We introduce a novel computational method that detects mutational signatures in cell lines by stringently adjusting for the confounding germline mutational processes, which are difficult to remove when healthy samples from the same individuals are not available. This revealed many associations between diverse mutational signatures and drug activity in cancer cell lines, which are comparably or more numerous than associations with classical genetic features such as cancer driver mutations or copy number alterations. Validation across independent drug screening data and across genetic screens involving drug target genes revealed hundreds of robustly supported associations, which are provided as a resource for drug repurposing guided by mutational signature markers. We suggest that cancer cells bearing genomic signatures of deficiencies in certain DNA repair pathways may be vulnerable to particular types of therapeutics, such as epigenetic drugs.",

Application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer has the potential to fulfil this requirement. We have developed a multiplexing assay which pools PCR amplicons for MinION sequencing to enable sequencing of multiple templates from multiple individuals which could be applied to gene-targeted diagnostics.\n\nMethodsA combined strategy of barcoding and sample pooling was developed for simultaneous multiplex MinION sequencing of 100 PCR amplicons, spanning 30 loci in DNA isolated from 82 neurodevelopmental cases and family members. The target regions were chosen for further interegation because a potentially disease-causative variants had been identified in affected individuals by Illumina exome sequencing. The pooled MinION sequences were deconvoluted by aligning to custom references using the guppy aligner software.\n\nResultsOur multiplexing approach produced interpretable and expected sequence from 29 of the 30 targeted genetic loci. The sequence variant which was not correctly resolved in the MinION sequence was adjacent to a five nucleotide homopolymer. It is already known that homopolymers present a resolution problem with the MinION approach. Interstingly despite equimolar quantities of PCR amplicon pooled for sequencing, significant variation in the depth of coverage (139x - 21,499x; mean = 9,050, std err = 538.21) was observed. We observed independent relationships between depth of coverage and target length, and depth of coverage and GC content. These relationships demonstrate biases of the MinION sequencer for longer templates and those with lower GC content.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate an efficient approach for variant discovery or confirmation from short DNA templates using the MinION sequencing device. With less than 140x depth of coverage required for accurate genotyping, the methodology described here allows for rapid highly multiplexed targeted sequencing of large numbers of samples in a minimally equipped laboratory.",

We created Portal, a unified framework of adversarial domain translation to learn harmonized representations of datasets. With innovation in model and algorithm designs, Portal achieves superior performance in preserving biological variation during integration, while achieving integration of millions of cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that Portal is widely applicable to integrating datasets across samples, platforms and data types (including scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). Finally, we demonstrate the power of Portal by applying it to the integration of cross-species datasets with limited shared information among them, elucidating biological insights into the similarities and divergences in the spermatogenesis process among mouse, macaque and human.",

However, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacteria typically relies on culture, which represents a major hurdle for generating such data for a wide range of species for which culture is challenging. In this study, we assessed the use of culture-free target-enrichment sequencing as a method for generating genomic data for two bacterial species: 1) Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax in both people and animals and whose culture requires high level containment facilities; and 2) Mycoplasma amphoriforme, a fastidious emerging human respiratory pathogen. We obtained high quality genomic data for both species directly from clinical samples, with sufficient coverage (>15X) for confident variant calling over at least 80% of the baited genomes for over two thirds of the samples tested. Higher qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (indicative of lower pathogen concentrations in the samples), pooling libraries prior to capture, and lower captured library concentration were all statistically associated with lower capture efficiency. The Ct value had the highest predictive value, explaining 52% of the variation in capture efficiency. Samples with Ct values [&le;] 30 were over 6 times more likely to achieve the threshold coverage than those with a Ct > 30. We conclude that target-enrichment sequencing provides a valuable alternative to standard WGS following bacterial culture and creates opportunities for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of many clinically important pathogens for which culture is challenging.\n\nData summaryThe authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.

    "preprint_abstract": "AimClimate shapes the composition and function of plant communities globally, but it remains unclear how this influence extends to floral traits. Flowering phenology, or the time period in which a species flowers, has well-studied relationships with climatic signals at the species level but has rarely been explored at a cross-community and continental scale. Here, we characterise the distribution of flowering periods (months of flowering) across continental plant communities encompassing six biomes, and determine the influence of climate on community flowering period lengths.\n\nLocationAustralia\n\nTaxonFlowering plants\n\nMethodsWe combined plant composition and abundance data from 629 standardised floristic surveys (AusPlots) with data on flowering period from the AusTraits database and additional primary literature for 2,983 species. We assessed abundance-weighted community mean flowering periods across biomes and tested their relationship with climatic annual means and the predictability of climate conditions using regression models.\n\nResultsCombined, temperature and precipitation (annual mean and predictability) explain 29% of variation in continental community flowering period. Plant communities with higher mean temperatures and lower mean precipitation have longer mean flowering periods. Moreover, plant communities in climates with predictable temperatures and, to a lesser extent, predictable precipitation have shorter mean flowering periods. Flowering period varies by biome, being longest in deserts and shortest in alpine and montane communities. For instance, desert communities experience low and unpredictable precipitation and high, unpredictable temperatures and have longer mean flowering periods, with desert species typically flowering at any time of year in response to rain.\n\nMain conclusionsOur findings demonstrate the role of current climate conditions in shaping flowering periods across biomes, with implications under climate change. Shifts in flowering periods across climatic gradients reflect changes in plant strategies, affecting patterns of plant growth and reproduction as well as the availability of floral resources across the landscape.",

DJ-1 bound to PDH-E1 beta (PDHB), inhibiting the phosphorylation of PDH-E1 alpha (PDHA), thus promoting PDH activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Dj-1 depletion impaired Treg proliferation and cellularity maintenance in older mice, increasing the severity during the remission phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The compromised proliferation and differentiation of Tregs in Dj-1 knockout mice were caused via regulating PDH activity.

A commonly used tool to detect geographic patterns from genetic data is principal components analysis (PCA) or the supervised linear discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). However, genetic features produced from both approaches could fail to correctly characterize population structure for complex scenarios involving admixture. In this study, we introduce Kernel Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (KLFDAPC), a supervised nonlinear approach for inferring individual geographic genetic structure that could rectify the limitations of these approaches by preserving the multimodal space of samples. We tested the power of KLFDAPC to infer population structure and to predict individual geographic origin using neural networks. Simulation results showed that KLFDAPC significantly improved the population separability compared with PCA and DAPC. The application to POPRES and CONVERGE datasets indicated that the first two reduced features of KLFDAPC correctly recapitulated the geography of individuals, and significantly improved the accuracy of predicting individual geographic origin when compared to PCA and DAPC. Therefore, KLFDAPC can be useful for geographic ancestry inference, design of genome scans and correction for spatial stratification in GWAS that link genes to adaptation or disease susceptibility.",

Here, we examined the effect of five different pH levels (5.5 to 7.0) on n-caprylate (C8) production using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) with continuous membrane-based liquid-liquid extraction (pertraction). We found that the product spectrum was directed by pH: mildly acidic pH (5-6) led to n-caproate (C6) production, while near-neutral and neutral pH (6.75-7) favored n-caprylate production. In particular, the pH of 6.75 led to the maximum values of volumetric n-caprylate production rate (75.6 {+/-} 0.6 mmol C L-1 d-1; 0.06 g L-1 d-1) and n-caprylate concentration in the fermentation broth (420 mM C; 7.57 g L-1). Given that methane production remained low at near-neutral and neutral pH, we theorized that the high concentration of undissociated n-caprylic acid (5.71 mM C) inhibited methanogenesis. We then demonstrated such an inhibitory effect at neutral pH in: (1) microcosm experiments; and (2) the continuous bioreactor by adding methanogenic sludge. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that near-neutral and neutral pH led to more diverse microbial communities than at mildly-acidic pH. For the first time, we report predominant n-caprylate production in a microbiome at near-neutral and neutral pH conditions where methanogenesis was controlled by the inhibitory effects of undissociated n-caprylic acid. At the same time, extraction of this species occurred even at near-neutral and neutral pH.",

It has been described that ovalbumin (OVA)-induced food allergy in mice is associated with anxiety and aversive behavior. However, it is yet to be determined whether altered behavior is a general component of food allergy or whether it is specific for some types of allergens. Thus, we investigated behavioral and neuroimmune circuits triggered by allergic sensitization to BLG. We found a neuroimmune conflict between aversion and reward in a model of food allergy induced to BLG. Mice sensitized to BLG did not present aversive behavior when the allergen was used for sensitization and oral challenge. Mice allergic to BLG preferred to drink the allergen-containing solution over water even though they presented high levels of specific IgE, inflammatory cells in the intestinal mucosa and significant weight loss. When sensitized to OVA and orally challenged with the same antigen, mice had display neuron activation in the amygdala suggesting an anxiety-related sensation. On the other hand, OVA-sensitized mice showed preference to consume a mixture of BLG and OVA during oral challenge in spite of their aversion to OVA. Consumption of OVA-BLG solution was associated with neuron activation in the nucleus accumbens, suggesting a reward sensation. Thus, the aversive behavior observed in food allergy to OVA does not apply to all antigens and some allergens may induce preference rather than aversion. Our study provides new insights into the neuroimmune conflicts regarding preference and avoidance to a common antigen associated with food allergy.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tendons are force transmitting mechanosensitive tissues predominantly comprised of highly aligned collagen type I fibres. In this study, the recently introduced gel aspiration-ejection method was used to rapidly fabricate aligned dense collagen (ADC) hydrogel scaffolds. ADCs provide a biomimetic environment compared to traditional collagen hydrogels that are mechanically unstable and comprised of randomly oriented fibrils. The ADC scaffolds were shown to be anisotropic with comparable stiffness to immature tendons. Furthermore, the application of static and cyclic uniaxial loading, short-term (48 h) and high-strain (20%), resulted in a 3-fold increase in both the ultimate tensile strength and modulus of ADCs. Similar mechanical activation of human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) seeded ADCs in serum- and growth factor-free medium induced their tenogenic differentiation. Both static and cyclic loading profiles resulted in a greater than 12-fold increase in scleraxis gene expression and either suppressed or maintained osteogenic and chondrogenic expressions. Following the 48 h mechanoactivation period, the MSC-seeded scaffolds were matured by tethering in basal medium without further external mechanical stimulation for 19 days, altogether making up 21 days of culture. Extensive cell-induced matrix remodeling and deposition of collagens type I and III, tenascin-C and tenomodulin were observed, where initial cyclic loading induced significantly higher tenomodulin protein content. Moreover, the initial short-term mechanical stimulation elongated and polarized seeded MSCs and overall cell alignment was significantly increased in those under static loading. These findings indicate the regenerative potential of the ADC scaffolds for short-term mechanoactivated tenogenic differentiation, which were achieved even in the absence of serum and growth factors that may potentially increase clinical translatability.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/470026v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d52807org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13716c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b7ffeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103c183_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "preprint_abstract": "The slime of velvet worms (Onychophora) is a strong and fully biodegradable protein material, which upon ejection undergoes a fast liquid-to-solid transition to ensnare prey. However, the molecular mechanisms of slime self-assembly are still not well understood, notably because the primary structures of slime proteins are yet unknown. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic studies, we have obtained the complete primary sequences of slime proteins and identified key features for slime self-assembly. The high molecular weight slime proteins contain Cys residues at the N- and C-termini that mediate the formation of multi-protein complexes via disulfide bonding. Low complexity domains in the N-termini were also identified and their propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation established, which may play a central role for slime biofabrication. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, rigid and flexible domains of the slime proteins were mapped to specific peptide domains. The complete sequencing of major slime proteins is an important step towards sustainable fabrication of polymers inspired by the velvet worm slime.",

Time is a key variable in the organization of memories, since events experienced close in time are more likely to be meaningfully associated, while those experienced with a longer interval are not1-4. How does the brain segregate events that are temporally distinct? Here, we report that a delayed (12-24h) increase in the expression of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), an immune receptor well known as a co-receptor for HIV infection6,7, following the formation of a contextual memory, determines the duration of the temporal window for associating or linking that memory with subsequent memories. This delayed CCR5 expression in mouse dorsal CA1 (dCA1) neurons results in a decrease in neuronal excitability, which in turn negatively regulates neuronal memory allocation, thus reducing the overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles. Lowering this overlap affects the ability of one memory to trigger the recall of the other, thus closing the temporal window for memory linking. Remarkably, our findings also show that an age-related increase in CCL5/CCR5 expression leads to impairments in memory linking in aged mice, which could be reversed with a CCR5 knockout and an FDA approved drug that inhibits this receptor, a result with significant clinical implications. All together the findings reported here provide the first insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that shape the temporal window for memory linking.",

Cells cope with these variants by having multiple copies of each tRNA isodecoder and through pathways that deal with proteotoxic stress. In this study, we define the genetic interactions of the gene encoding tRNASerUGG,G26A, which mistranslates serine at proline codons. Using a collection of yeast temperature sensitive alleles, we identify negative synthetic genetic interactions between the mistranslating tRNA and 109 alleles representing 91 genes, with nearly half of the genes having roles in RNA processing or protein folding and turnover. By regulating tRNA expression, we then compare the strength of the negative genetic interaction for a subset of identified alleles under differing amounts of mistranslation. The frequency of mistranslation correlated with impact on cell growth for all strains analyzed; however, there were notable differences in the extent of the synthetic interaction at different frequencies of mistranslation depending on the genetic background. For many of the strains the extent of the negative interaction with tRNASerUGG,G26A was proportional to the frequency of mistranslation or only observed at intermediate or high frequencies. For others the synthetic interaction was approximately equivalent at all frequencies of mistranslation. As humans contain similar mistranslating tRNAs these results are important when analyzing the impact of tRNA variants on disease, where both the individuals genetic background and the expression of the mistranslating tRNA variant need to be considered.",

The system has two modes: still image mode by wide scanning and moving image mode by small rotation of sensor array. Optical test target, euthanized mice and rats, and live mice were used as objects.\n\nResultsThe results of optical test target showed that the spatial resolution was about 2 times higher than that of our conventional prototype. The image performance in vivo was evaluated in euthanized healthy mice and rats, allowing visualization of detailed blood vessels in the liver and kidneys. In tumor-bearing mice, different results of vascular induction were shown depending on the type of tumor and the method of transplantation. By utilizing the video imaging function, we were able to observe the movement of blood vessels around the tumor.\n\nConclusionWe have demonstrated the feasibility of the system as a less invasive animal experimental device, as it can acquire vascular images in animals in a non-contrast and non-invasive manner.",

In long-lived species, like primates, lifespan is one of the main components of fitness. We used 18 years of data from the Lomas Barbudal Monkey project to quantify social integration in 11 capuchin (Cebus capucinus) groups and tested whether female survivorship was associated with females tendencies to interact with three types of partners: (1) all group members, (2) adult females, (3) adult males. We found strong evidence that females who engaged more with other females in affiliative interactions and foraged in close proximity experienced increased survivorship. We found some weak evidence that females might also benefit from engaging in more support in agonistic contexts with other females. These benefits were evident in models that account for the females rank and group size. Female interactions with all group members also increased survival, but the estimates of the effects were more uncertain. In interactions with adult males, only females who provided more grooming to males survived longer. The results presented here suggest that social integration may result in survival-related benefits. Females might enjoy these benefits through exchanging grooming for other currencies, such as coalitionary support or tolerance.",

Epigenetic changes may facilitate early self-domestication in humans, since they can be the first layer of response to a novel environment. Here, we argue that fish provide model systems to study epigenetic drivers in human self-domestication. To do this, we compare genes that carry epigenetic changes in early domesticates of European sea bass with 1) anatomically modern humans and 2) neurodevelopmental cognitive disorders with abnormal self-domestication traits, i.e., schizophrenia, Williams syndrome and autism spectrum disorders. We found that genes with epigenetic changes in fish and in modern vs ancient humans were shared and were involved in processes like limb morphogenesis and phenotypes like abnormal snout morphology and hypopigmentation. Moreover, early domestication in fish and neurodevelopmental cognitive impairment in humans affected paralogue genes involved in processes such as neural crest differentiation and ectoderm differentiation. We conclude that parallel epigenetic changes may occur at the initial steps of domestication in absence of deliberate selection in phylogenetically distant vertebrates. These findings pave the way for future studies using fish as models to investigate epigenetic changes as drivers of human-self domestication and as triggers of cognitive disorders.",

Barnes maze and What Where When Episodic-like memory testing showed that 6-OHDA lesions disrupted spatial working and episodic memory functions in both sexes, and that in males, androgen-sensitive behaviors could be rescued in subjects where circulating androgen levels were diminished. Here we tested similar animal groups using the Novel Object Preference (NOP) and Object-in-Place (OiP) tasks. This revealed two entirely different patterns of sex and sex hormone influence. First, for both tasks, 6-ODHA lesions impaired object discrimination in males but not females. Further, for the NOP task, 6-OHDA lesions disrupted discrimination in males rats independently of hormone status. And finally, 6-OHDA lesions impaired OiP performance in males regardless of whether androgen levels were high or low but had no effect on discrimination in gonadectomized rats given 17{beta}-estradiol. Together with previous findings, these data identify the impacts of sex and sex hormones on cognition and memory in PD as behavioral task/behavioral domain specific.

We find that ETS-5 directly regulates the expression of INS-1, an insulin-like peptide, in the BAG sensory neurons. INS-1 expression in the BAG neurons, and not in other INS-1-expressing neurons, decreases intestinal lipid levels and promotes foraging behaviour. Using in vivo analysis, we show that elevated intestinal lipid stores, driven by a high glucose diet, downregulates ETS-5-driven expression of INS-1.

Herein, we found that Nrf1 stability and transactivity are both enhanced by USP19, a ubiquitin-specific protease tail-anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its C-terminal transmembrane domain. Further experiments revealed that USP19 directly interacts with Nrf1 in proximity to the ER and topologically acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme to remove ubiquitin moieties from this protein, and hence allows it to circumvent the potential proteasomal degradation. Such USP19-mediated effect takes place only after Nrf1 is retrotranslocated by p97 out of ER membranes to dislocate the cytoplasmic side. Conversely, knockout of USP19 causes significant decreases in the Nrf1 abundance and its active isoform entering the nucleus, resulting in down-regulation of its target proteasomal subunits. This led to a modest reduction of USP19-/--derived tumor growth in xenograft mice, when compared with wild-type controls. Altogether, these demonstrate that USP19 serves as a novel mechanistic modulator of Nrf1, but not Nrf2, enabling Nrf1 to be rescued from putative ubiquitin-directed ER-associated degradation pathway. In turn, our additional experimental evidence has unraveled that transcriptional expression of endogenous USP19 and its promoter-driven reporter genes is differentially regulated by Nrf2, as well by Nrf1, at distinct layers within a complex hierarchical regulatory network.",

We thus propose recontextualizing epileptogenesis as a process where reduction in cellular heterogeneity in part, renders neural circuits less resilient to seizure. By comparing patch clamp recordings from human layer 5 (L5) cortical pyramidal neurons from epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic tissue, we demonstrate significantly decreased biophysical heterogeneity in seizure generating areas. Implemented computationally, this renders model neural circuits prone to sudden transitions into synchronous states with increased firing activity, paralleling ictogenesis. This computational work also explains the surprising finding of significantly decreased excitability in the population activation functions of neurons from epileptogenic tissue. Finally, mathematical analyses reveal a unique bifurcation structure arising only with low heterogeneity and associated with seizure-like dynamics. Taken together, this work provides experimental, computational, and mathematical support for the theory that ictogenic dynamics accompany a reduction in biophysical heterogeneity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Listening to speech is difficult in noisy environments, and is even harder when the interfering noise consists of intelligible speech as compared to unintelligible sounds. This suggests that the competing linguistic information interferes with the neural processing of target speech. Interference could either arise from a degradation of the neural representation of the target speech, or from increased representation of distracting speech that enters in competition with the target speech. We tested these alternative hypotheses using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants listened to a target clear speech in the presence of distracting noise-vocoded speech. Crucially, the distractors were initially unintelligible but became more intelligible after a short training session. Results showed that the comprehension of the target speech was poorer after training than before training. The neural tracking of target speech in the delta range (1-4 Hz) reduced in strength in the presence of a more intelligible distractor. In contrast, the neural tracking of distracting signals was not significantly modulated by intelligibility. These results suggest that the presence of distracting speech signals degrades the linguistic representation of target speech carried by delta oscillations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Sloths have a dense coat on which insects, algae, and fungi coexist in a symbiotic relationship. This complex ecosystem requires different levels of control, however, most of these mechanisms remain unknown. We investigated the bacterial communities inhabiting the hair of two- (Choloepus Hoffmani) and three-toed (Bradypus variegatus) sloths and evaluated their potential for producing antibiotic molecules capable of exerting control over the hair microbiota. The analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) revealed that the communities in both host species are dominated by Actinobacteriota and Firmicutes. The most abundant genera were Brevibacterium, Kocuria/Rothia, Staphylococcus, Rubrobacter, Nesterenkonia, and Janibacter. In addition, we isolated nine strains of Brevibacterium and Rothia able to produce substances that inhibited the growth of common mammalian pathogens. The analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BCGs) of these nine isolates suggests that the pathogen-inhibitory activity could be mediated by the presence of siderophores, terpenes, beta-lactones, Type III polyketide synthases (T3PKS), ribosomally synthesized, and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), non-alpha poly-amino acids (NAPAA) like e-Polylysin, ectoine or nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). Our data suggest that Micrococcales inhabiting sloth hair could have a role in controlling microbial populations in that habitat, improving our understanding of this highly complex ecosystem.",

However, a universal method to obtain freshly purified cardiomyocytes without using different agedependent isolation procedures and cell culture, is lacking. Here, we report the development of a standardised method that allows rapid isolation and purification of high-quality cardiomyocytes from individual neonatal through to adult C57BL/6J murine hearts. Langendorff retrograde perfusion, which is currently limited to adult hearts, was adapted for use in neonatal and infant hearts by developing an easier in situ aortic cannulation technique. Tissue digestion conditions were optimised to achieve efficient digestion of hearts of all ages in a comparable timeframe (<14 min). This resulted in a high yield (1.56-2.2x106 cells/heart) and viability (~70-100%) of cardiomyocytes post-isolation. An immunomagnetic cell separation step was then applied to yield highly purified cardiomyocytes (~95%) as confirmed by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR. For cell-type specific studies, cardiomyocyte DNA, RNA, and protein could be extracted in sufficient yields to conduct molecular experiments. We generated transcriptomic datasets for neonatal cardiomyocytes from individual hearts, for the first time, which revealed nine sex-specific genes (FDR<0.05) encoded on the sex chromosomes. Finally, we also developed an in situ fixation protocol that preserved the native cytoarchitecture of cardiomyocytes (~94% rodshaped post-isolation), and used it to evaluate cell morphology during cardiomyocyte maturation, as well as capture spindle-shaped neonatal cells undergoing cytokinesis. Together, these procedures allow molecular and morphological profiling of high-quality cardiomyocytes from individual hearts of any postnatal age.",

In addition, the high stability of supported lipid bilayers allows for their study via a wide array of experimental probes. In this work, we describe a platform for supported lipid bilayers that is accessible both electrically and optically. We show that the polarization of the supported membrane can be electrically controlled and optically probed using voltage-sensitive dyes. Membrane polarization dynamics is understood through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the analysis of the equivalent electrical circuit. We also describe the effect of the conducting electrode layer on the fluorescence of the optical probe through metal-induced energy transfer.

Through extensive genetic analyses we uncover cis-regulatory elements in the Dcp2 C-terminal domain that control selective targeting of the decapping enzyme by forming distinct decapping complexes. Two Upf1-binding motifs target the decapping enzyme to NMD substrates, and a single Edc3-binding motif targets both Edc3 and Dhh1 substrates. Pat1-binding leucine-rich motifs target Edc3 and Dhh1 substrates under selective conditions. Although it functions as a unique targeting component of specific complexes, Edc3 is a common component of multiple complexes. Xrn1 also has a specific Dcp2 binding site, allowing it to be directly recruited to decapping complexes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Upf1, Edc3, and Pat1 function as regulatory subunits of the holo-decapping enzyme, controlling both its targeting specificity and enzymatic activation.\n\nHighlightsLoss of Dcp2 cis-binding elements causes selective stabilization of distinct decapping substrates\n\nDcp2 cis-binding elements promote the assembly of target-specific decapping complexes in vivo\n\nXrn1 binds to Dcp2, and both Edc3 and Xrn1 are common components of multiple decapping complexes\n\nUpf1, Edc3, and Pat1 function as unique targeting subunits of the yeast holo-decapping enzyme",

While databases like PhosphoSitePlus contain information about many phosphorylation sites, the vast majority of known sites are not assigned to any protein kinase. Assigning changes in the phosphoproteome to the activity of individual kinases therefore remains a key challenge.. A recent large-scale study systematically identified in vitro substrates for most human protein kinases. Here, we reprocessed and filtered these data to generate an in vitro Kinase-to-Phosphosite database (iKiP-DB). We show that iKiP-DB can accurately predict changes in kinase activity in published phosphoproteomic datasets for both well-studied and poorly characterized kinases. We apply iKiP-DB to a newly generated phosphoproteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung epithelial cells and provide evidence for coronavirus-induced changes in host cell kinase activity. In summary, we show that iKiP-DB is widely applicable to facilitate the functional analysis of phosphoproteomic datasets.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Each gene has its own evolutionary history which can substantially differ from the evolutionary histories of other genes. For example, some individual genes or operons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer and recombination events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different evolutionary patterns from the species tree that accounts for the main patterns of vertical descent. The output of traditional consensus tree or supertree inference methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. Here, we describe a new efficient method for inferring multiple alternative consensus trees and supertrees to best represent the most important evolutionary patterns of a given set of phylogenetic trees (i.e. additive trees or X-trees). We show how a specific version of the popular k-means clustering algorithm, based on some interesting properties of the Robinson and Foulds topological distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (when the data are homogeneous) or multiple (when the data are heterogeneous) cluster(s) of trees. We adapt the popular Cali[n]ski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Ball and Hall, and Gap cluster validity indices to tree clustering with k-means. A special attention is paid to the relevant but very challenging problem of inferring alternative supertrees, built from phylogenies constructed for different, but mutually overlapping, sets of taxa. The use of the Euclidean approximation in the objective function of the method makes it faster than the existing tree clustering techniques, and thus perfectly suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets. In this study, we apply it to discover alternative supertrees characterizing the main patterns of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the related betacoronaviruses.",

Here, we provide the first direct evidence that TGF{beta} signaling is required for resegmentation of the sclerotome using chick embryos. Lipophilic fluorescent tracers, DiO and DiD, were microinjected into adjacent somites of embryos treated with or without TGF{beta}R1 inhibitor, SB431542, at developmental day E2.5 (HH16). Lineage tracing of labeled cells was observed over the course of 4 days until the completion of resegmentation at E6.5 (HH32). Vertebrae were malformed and intervertebral discs were small and misshapen in SB431542 injected embryos. Hypaxial myofibers were also increased in thickness after treatment with the inhibitor. Inhibition of TGF{beta} signaling resulted in alterations in resegmentation that ranged between full, partial, and slanted shifts in distribution of DiO or DiD labeled cells within vertebrae. Patterning of rostro- caudal markers within sclerotome was disrupted at E3.5 after treatment with SB431542 with rostral domains expressing both rostral and caudal markers. We propose that TGF{beta} signaling regulates rostro-caudal polarity and subsequent resegmentation in sclerotome during spinal column development.",

We investigated the contribution of circadian regulation to aspects of photosynthesis in Marchantia polymorpha, a liverwort that diverged from flowering plants early in the evolution of land plants. First, we identified in M. polymorpha the circadian regulation of photosynthetic biochemistry, measured using two approaches (delayed fluorescence, PAM fluorescence). Second, we identified that light-dark cycles synchronize the phase of 24 h cycles of photosynthesis in M. polymorpha, whereas the phases of different thalli desynchronize under free running conditions. This might also be due to masking of the underlying circadian rhythms of photosynthesis by light-dark cycles. Finally, we used a pharmacological approach to identify that chloroplast translation might be necessary for clock control of light harvesting in M. polymorpha. We infer that the circadian regulation of photosynthesis are well-conserved amongst terrestrial plants.",

Here, we investigated how deep soil (down to 300 cm) water extraction contributed to the provision of water in the Fontainebleau-Barbeau temperate oak forest over two years, including the 2018 record drought. Deep water provision was key to sustain canopy transpiration during drought, with layers below 150 cm contributing up to 60% of the transpired water in August 2018, despite their very low density of fine roots. We further showed that soil databases used to parameterize ecosystem models largely underestimated the amount of water extractable from the soil by trees, due to a considerable underestimation of the tree rooting depth. The consensus database established for France gave an estimate of 207 mm for the soil water holding capacity (SWHC) at Fontainebleau-Barbeau, when our estimate based on the analysis of soil water content measurements was 1.9 times as high, reaching 390{+/-}17 mm. Running the CASTANEA forest model with the database-derived SWHC yielded a 350 gC m-2 y-1 average underestimation of annual gross primary productivity under current climate, reaching up to 700 gC m-2 y-1 under climate change scenario RCP8.5. It is likely that the strong underestimation of SWHC that we show at our site is not a special case, and concerns a large number of forest sites.

In a small cohort of healthy controls (n=21) and patients (n=12) with either the m.3243A>G mutation or single, large-scale mtDNA deletions, we examined: i) cytokine responses (IL-6, TNF-, IL-1{beta}) in response to acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, and ii) sensitivity to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoid signaling (dexamethasone) on cytokine production. In dose-response experiments to determine the half-maximal effective LPS concentration (EC50), relative to controls, leukocytes from patients with mtDNA deletions showed 74 - 79% lower responses for IL-6 and IL-1{beta} (pIL-6=0.031, pIL-1{beta}=0.009). Moreover, IL-6 response to LPS in presence of GC was also blunted in cells from patients with mtDNA deletions (pIL-6=0.006), but not in leukocytes from patients with the m.3243A>G mutation. Overall, these ex vivo data provide preliminary evidence that some systemic OxPhos defects may compromise immune cytokine responses and glucocorticoid sensitivity.

Currently available drugs treating such pathological conditions have limited efficacy and diverse side effects, revealing the need of new safer strategies. Aromatic plant-based compounds are largely used in herbal medicine due to their therapeutic properties on mood, physiology, and general well-being. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 2-phenylethyl alcohol (PEA), one of the pharmacologically active constituents of rose essential oil, on chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced behavioral and neurobiological changes in female mice. Animals followed a prolonged PEA inhalation exposure (30 min per day) for 15 consecutive days prior to behavioral evaluation with open-field, forced swim and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. CORT treatment induced an anxio-depressive-like phenotype, evidenced by a reduced locomotor activity in the open-field, and an increased latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding paradigms. To elucidate the neural correlates of our behavioral results, cerebral cFos expression analysis was further performed to provide a global map of neuronal activity. The altered feeding behavior was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of cFos-positive cells in the olfactory bulb, and altered brain connectivity as shown by cross-correlation-based network analysis. CORT-induced behavioral and neurobiological alterations were reversed by prolonged PEA inhalation, suggesting a therapeutic action that allows regulating the activity of neural circuits involved in sensory, emotional and feeding behaviors. These findings might contribute to better understand the therapeutic potential of PEA on anxio-depressive symptoms.",

These declines correlate with neuronal changes in synaptic structure and function. Degradation of brain network activity and connectivity represents a likely mediator of age-related functional deterioration resulting from these neuronal changes. Human studies have demonstrated both general decreases in spontaneous cortical activity and disruption of cortical networks with aging. Current techniques used to study cerebral network activity are hampered either by limited spatial resolution (e.g. electroencephalography, EEG) or limited temporal resolution (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI). Here we utilize mesoscale imaging of neuronal activity in Thy1-GCaMP6f mice to characterize neuronal network changes in aging with high spatial resolution across a wide frequency range. We show that while evoked activity is unchanged with aging, spontaneous neuronal activity decreases across a wide frequency range (0.01-4Hz) involving all regions of the cortex. In contrast to this global reduction in cortical power, we found that aging is associated with functional connectivity (FC) deterioration of select networks including somatomotor, cingulate, and retrosplenial nodes. These changes are corroborated by reductions in homotopic FC and node degree within somatomotor and visual cortices. Finally, we found that whole cortex delta power and delta band node degree correlate with exploratory activity in young but not aged animals. Together these data suggest that aging is associated with global declines in spontaneous cortical activity and focal deterioration of network connectivity, and that these reductions may be associated with age-related behavioral declines.",

Emerging literature has suggested that functional interactions between brain regions emerge from the structural connections through mono-as well as polysynaptic mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach based on diffusion maps and Riemannian optimization to emulate this dynamic mechanism in the form of random walks on the structural connectome and predict functional interactions as a weighted combination of these random walks. Our proposed approach was evaluated in two different cohorts of healthy adults (Human Connectome Project, HCP; Microstructure-Informed Connectomics, MICs). Our approach outperformed existing approaches and showed that performance plateaus approximately around the third random walk. At macroscale, we found that the largest number of walks was required in nodes of the default mode and frontoparietal networks, underscoring an increasing relevance of polysynaptic communication mechanisms in transmodal cortical networks compared to primary and unimodal systems.",

Preregistration of the hypotheses and methods of an empirical study before analysis, the sharing of primary research data, and compliance with data standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), are considered effective practices to secure progress and to substantiate quality of research. We investigated the current level of adoption of open science practices in neuroimaging and the difficulties that prevent researchers from using them.\n\nEmail invitations to participate in the survey were sent to addresses received through a PubMed search of human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies between 2010 and 2020. 283 persons completed the questionnaire.\n\nAlthough half of the participants were experienced with preregistration, the willingness to preregister studies in the future was modest. The majority of participants had experience with the sharing of primary neuroimaging data. Most of the participants were interested in implementing a standardized data structure such as BIDS in their labs. Based on demographic variables, we compared participants on seven subscales, which had been generated through factor analysis. It was found that experienced researchers at lower career level had higher fear of being transparent, researchers with residence in the EU had a higher need for data governance, and researchers at medical faculties as compared to other university faculties reported a higher need for data governance and a more unsupportive environment.\n\nThe results suggest growing adoption of open science practices but also highlight a number of important impediments.",

While slow waves themselves are mainly generated by cortical neurons, it is not clear what role thalamic activity plays in the generation of some oscillations grouped by slow waves, and to what extent thalamic activity during slow waves is itself driven by corticothalamic inputs. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded both scalp EEG and local field potentials from six thalamic nuclei (bilateral anterior, mediodorsal and ventral anterior) in fifteen epileptic patients (age-range: 17-64 years, 7 females) undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation Protocol and assessed the temporal evolution of thalamic activity relative to scalp slow waves using time-frequency analysis. We found that thalamic activity in all six nuclei during scalp slow waves is highly similar to what is observed on the scalp itself. Slow wave downstates are characterized by delta, theta and alpha activity and followed by beta, high sigma and low sigma activity during subsequent upstates. Gamma activity in the thalamus is not significantly grouped by slow waves. Theta and alpha activity appeared first on the scalp, but sigma activity appeared first in the thalamus. These effects were largely independent from the scalp region in which SWs were detected and the precise identity of thalamic nuclei. Our results indicate that while small thalamocortical neuron assemblies may initiate cortical oscillations, especially in the sleep spindle range, the large-scale neuronal activity in the thalamus which is detected by field potentials is principally driven by global cortical activity, and thus it is highly similar to what is observed on the scalp.",

While the technical advances spearheaded by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) led to significant improvements in dMRI data quality, it remains unclear how these data should be analyzed to maximize tractography accuracy. Over a period of two years, we have engaged the dMRI community in the IronTract Challenge, which aims to answer this question by leveraging a unique dataset. Macaque brains that have received both tracer injections and ex vivo dMRI at high spatial and angular resolution allow a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of tractography accuracy on state-of-the-art dMRI acquisition schemes. We find that, when analysis methods are carefully optimized, the HCP scheme can achieve similar accuracy as a more time-consuming, Cartesian-grid scheme. Importantly, we show that simple pre- and post-processing strategies can improve the accuracy and robustness of many tractography methods. Finally, we find that fiber configurations that go beyond crossing (e.g., fanning, branching) are the most challenging for tractography. The IronTract Challenge remains open and we hope that it can serve as a valuable validation tool for both users and developers of dMRI analysis methods.",

However, the source of the OTergic innervation, the cellular targets expressing the OT receptors (OTRs) and whether the PVN-to-CA2 OTergic system is altered during heart failure (HF), a condition recently associated with cognitive and mood decline, remains unknown. Using immunohistochemistry along with retrograde monosynaptic tracing, RNAscope and a novel OTR-Cre rat line, we show that the PVN (but not the supraoptic nucleus) is an important source of OTergic innervation to the CA2. These OTergic fibers were found in many instances in close apposition to OTR expressing cells within the CA2. Interestingly, while only a small proportion of neurons were found to express OTRs ([~]15%), this expression was much more abundant in CA2 astrocytes ([~]40%), an even higher proportion that was recently reported for astrocytes in the central amygdala. Using an established ischemic rat heart failure (HF) model, we found that HF resulted in robust changes in the PVN-to-CA2 OTergic system, both at the source and target levels. Within the PVN, we found an increased OT immunoreactivity, along with a diminished OTR expression in PVN neurons. Within the CA2 of HF rats, we observed a blunted OTergic innervation, along with a diminished OTR expression, which appeared to be restricted to CA2 astrocytes. Taken together, our studies highlight astrocytes as key cellular targets mediating OTergic PVN inputs to the CA2 hippocampal region. Moreover, provides the first evidence for an altered PVN-to-CA2 OTergic system in HF rats, which could potentially contribute to previously reported cognitive and mood impairments in this animal model.",

We developed a RT-qPCR assay using tagged primers and thermostable reverse transcriptase, which greatly reduced the occurrence of nonspecific cDNA products. Furthermore, we optimized the assay for use in multiplex qPCR which allows for simultaneous quantitative detection of positive-strand and negative-strand ZIKV RNA along with an internal control from both human and mosquito cells. Importantly, this assay is sensitive enough to study early stages of virus infection in vitro. Strikingly, using this assay, we detected ZIKV negative-strand RNA as early as 3 h post-infection in mammalian cell culture, at a time point prior to the onset of positive-strand RNA synthesis. Overall, the strand-specific RT-qPCR assay developed herein is a valuable tool to quantify ZIKV RNA and to study viral replication dynamics during infection. The application of these findings has the potential to increase accuracy of RNA detection methods for a variety of viral pathogens.\n\nHighlightsO_LISelf-primed cDNA is amplified by widely-used ZIKV qPCR primer sets\nC_LIO_LIUse of tagged primers and thermostable RT increases strand-specificity for RT-qPCR\nC_LIO_LIMultiplexed qPCR allows for simultaneous quantitation of (+) and (-) strand viral RNAs, and an internal control\nC_LIO_LIStrand-specific RT-qPCR can detect fewer than one copy of viral RNA per cell in human and mosquito cells\nC_LI",

Designing a particle tracking pipeline is a routine but tedious task.

A good synergy between particle detector with a tracker is of paramount importance. In addition, a user-friendly interface to control the quality of estimated trajectories is necessary.

The T. gondii PLP1 (TgPLP1) mediates tachyzoite egress from cells, while the five Plasmodium PLPs carry out various roles in the life cycle of the parasite and with respect to the molecular basis of disease. Here we focus on Plasmodium vivax PLP1 and PLP2 (PvPLP1 and PvPLP2) compared to TgPLP1; PvPLP1 is important for invasion of mammalian hosts by the parasite and establishment of a chronic infection, PvPLP2 is important during the symptomatic blood stage of the parasite life cycle. Determination of the crystal structure of the membrane-binding APC{beta} domain of PvPLP1 reveals notable differences with that of TgPLP1, which are reflected in its inability to bind lipid bilayers in the way that TgPLP1 and PvPLP2 can be shown to. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays allow a dissection of the binding interactions of TgPLP1 and PvPLP2 on lipid bilayers, and reveal a similar tropism for lipids found enriched in the inner leaflet of the mammalian plasma membrane. In addition to this shared mode of membrane binding PvPLP2 displays a secondary synergistic interaction side-on from its principal bilayer interface. This study underlines the substantial differences between the biophysical properties of the APC{beta} domains of Apicomplexan PLPs, which reflect their significant sequence diversity. Such differences will be important factors in determining the cell targeting and membrane-binding activity of the different proteins, in their different developmental roles within parasite life cycles.",

Unfortunately, its estimation is inherently difficult, as it relates to the part of an epidemic which is, by definition, not observed.\n\nWe introduce a simple statistical method for estimating reporting, initially developed for the response to Ebola in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 2018-2020. This approach uses transmission chain data typically gathered through case investigation and contact tracing, and uses the proportion of investigated cases with a known, reported infector as a proxy for reporting. Using simulated epidemics, we study how this method performs for different outbreak sizes and reporting levels. Results suggest that our method has low bias, reasonable precision, and despite sub-optimal coverage, usually provides estimates within close range (5-10%) of the true value.\n\nBeing fast and simple, this method could be useful for estimating reporting in real-time in settings where person-to-person transmission is the main driver of the epidemic, and where case investigation is routinely performed as part of surveillance and contact tracing activities.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen responding to epidemics of infectious diseases, it is essential to estimate how many cases are not being reported. Unfortunately reporting, the proportion of cases actually observed, is difficult to estimate during an outbreak, as it typically requires large surveys to be conducted on the affected populations. Here, we introduce a method for estimating reporting from case investigation data, using the proportion of cases with a known, reported infector. We used simulations to test the performance of our approach by mimicking features of a recent Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We found that despite some uncertainty in smaller outbreaks, our approach can be used to obtain informative ballpark estimates of reporting under most settings. This method is simple and computationally inexpensive, and can be used to inform the response to any epidemic in which transmission events can be uncovered by case investigation.",

Both PAX-FOXO1s result in related cell transformation in animal models, but both mutations are associated with distinct pathological manifestations in patients. To assess the mechanisms underlying these differences, we generated isogenic fibroblast lines expressing either PAX-FOXO1 paralog. Mapping of their genomic recruitment using CUT&Tag revealed that the two chimeric proteins have distinct DNA binding preferences. In addition, PAX7-FOXO1 causes stronger de novo transactivation of its bound regions than PAX3-FOXO1, resulting in greater transcriptomic dynamics involving genes regulating cell shape and cycle. Consistently, PAX3-FOXO1 accentuates fibroblast cellular traits associated with contractility and surface adhesion and limits entry into M phase. In contrast, PAX7-FOXO1 drives cells to adopt an amoeboid shape, reduces entry into S phase, and causes more genomic instabilities. Altogether, our results argue that the diversity of rhabdomyosarcoma manifestation arises, in part, from the divergence between the transcriptional activities of PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1. Furthermore, the identified pronounced deleterious effects of PAX7-FOXO1 provide an explanation for the low frequency of the translocation generating this factor in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Each day and in conjunction with ambient daylight conditions, neuropeptide PDF regulates the phase and amplitude of locomotor activity rhythms in Drosophila through its receptor, PDFR, a Family B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). We studied the in vivo process by which PDFR signaling turns off, by converting as many as half of the 28 potential sites of phosphorylation in its C terminal tail to a non-phosphorylatable residue (alanine). We report that many such sites are conserved evolutionarily, and their conversion creates a specific behavioral syndrome opposite to loss-of-function phenotypes previously described for pdfr. That syndrome includes increases in the amplitudes of both Morning and Evening behavioral peaks, as well as multi-hour delays of the Evening phase. The precise behavioral effects were dependent on day-length, and most effects mapped to conversion of only a few, specific serine residues near the very end of the protein and specific to its A isoform. Behavioral phase delays under entraining conditions were often, but not always correlated with increases in circadian period. The behavioral phenotypes produced by the most severe PDFR variant were ligand-dependent in vivo, and not a consequence of changes to their pharmacological properties, nor of changes in their surface expression, as measured in vitro. The mechanisms underlying termination of PDFR signaling are complex, subject to regulation that is modified by season, and central to a better understanding of the peptidergic modulation of behavior.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn multi-cellular organisms, circadian pacemakers create output as a series of phase markers across the 24 hour day to allow other cells to pattern diverse aspects of daily rhythmic physiology and behavior. Within circadian pacemaker circuits, neuropeptide signaling is essential to help promote coherent circadian outputs. In the fruit fly Drosophila 150 neurons are dedicated circadian clocks and they all tell the same time. In spite of such strong synchronization, they provide diverse phasic outputs in the form of their discrete, asynchronous neuronal activity patterns. Neuropeptide signaling breaks the clock-generated symmetry and drives many pacemakers away from their preferred activity period in the morning. Each day, neuropeptide PDF is released by Morning pacemakers and delays the phase of activity of specific other pacemakers to later parts of the day or night. When and how the PDF that is released in the morning stops acting is unknown. Furthermore, timing of signal termination is not fixed because day length changes each day, hence the modulatory delay exerted by PDF must itself be regulated. Here we test a canonical model of G protein-coupled receptor physiology to ask how PDF receptor signaling is normally de-activated. We use behavioral measures to define sequence elements of the receptor whose post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) may define the duration of receptor signaling.",

    "preprint_abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that microbial symbionts influence key aspects of their hosts fitness, and vice versa. This may fundamentally change our thinking about how microbes and hosts interact in influencing fitness and adaptation to changing environments. Here we explore how reductions in population size commonly experienced by threatened species influence microbiome diversity. Consequences of such reductions are normally interpreted in terms of a loss of genetic variation, increased inbreeding and associated inbreeding depression. However, fitness effects of population bottlenecks might also be mediated through microbiome diversity, such as through loss of functionally important microbes. Here we utilise 50 Drosophila melanogaster lines with different histories of population bottlenecks to explore these questions. The lines were phenotyped for egg-to-adult viability and their genomes sequenced to estimate genetic variation. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified in these lines to investigate microbial diversity. We found that 1) host population bottlenecks constrained microbiome richness and diversity, 2) core microbiomes of hosts with low genetic variation were constituted from subsets of microbiomes found in flies with higher genetic variation, 3) both microbiome diversity and host genetic variation contributed to host population fitness, 4) connectivity and robustness of bacterial networks was low in the inbred lines regardless of host genetic variation, 5) reduced microbial diversity was associated with weaker evolutionary responses of hosts in stressful environments, and 6) these effects were unrelated to Wolbachia density. These findings suggest that population bottlenecks reduce hologenomic variation (combined host and microbial genetic variation). Thus, while the current biodiversity crisis focuses on population sizes and genetic variation of eukaryotes, an additional focal point should be the microbial diversity carried by the eukaryotes, which in turn may influence host fitness and adaptability with consequences for the persistence of populations.\n\nAuthor summaryIt is becoming increasingly clear that organisms and the microbes that live on or in them - their microbiome - affect each other in profound ways that we are just beginning to understand. For instance, a diverse microbiome can help maintain metabolic functions or fight pathogens causing diseases. A disrupted microbiome may be especially critical for animals and plants that occur in low numbers because of threats from e.g. human exploitation or climate change, as they may already suffer from genetic challenges such as inbreeding and reduced evolutionary potential. The importance of such a reduction in population size, called a bottleneck, on the microbial diversity and the potential interactive effects on host health remains unexplored. Here we experimentally test these associations by investigating the microbiomes of 50 inbred or non-inbred populations of vinegar flies. We found that restricting the population size constrain the hosts genetic variation and simultaneously decreases the diversity of the microbiome that they harbor, and that both effects were detrimental to host fitness. The microbial communities in inbred host populations were less robust than in their non-inbred counterparts, suggesting that we should increasingly consider the microbiome diversity, which may ultimately influence the health and persistence of threatened species.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene. Because the ATXN3 protein regulates photoreceptor ciliogenesis and phagocytosis, we aimed to explore whether expanded polyQ ATXN3 impacts retinal function and integrity in SCA3 patients and transgenic mice.\n\nWe evaluated the retinal structure and function in five patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and in a transgenic mouse model of this disease (YACMJD84.2, Q84) using, respectively, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinogram (ERG). We further determined in the transgenic mice: a) the retinal expression pattern of ATXN3 and assessed the distribution of cones and rods by immunofluorescence (IF); and b) the retinal ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n\nSome patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 in our cohort revealed: i) reduced central macular thickness indirectly correlated with disease duration; ii) decreased thickness of the macula and the ganglion cell layer, and reduced macula volume inversely correlated with disease severity (SARA score); and iii) electrophysiological dysfunction of cones, rods, and inner retinal cells. Transgenic mice replicated the human OCT and ERG findings with aged homozygous Q84/Q84 mice showing a stronger phenotype accompanied by further thinning of the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor layer and highly reduced cone and rod activities, thus supporting severe retinal dysfunction in these mice. In addition, Q84 mice showed progressive accumulation of ATXN3-positive aggregates throughout several retinal layers and depletion of cones alongside the disease course. TEM analysis of aged Q84/Q84 mouse retinas supported the IF ATXN3 aggregation findings by revealing the presence of high number of negative electron dense puncta in ganglion cells, inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers, and further showed thinning of the outer plexiform layer, thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium and elongation of apical microvilli.\n\nOur results indicate that retinal alterations detected by non-invasive eye examination using OCT and ERG could represent a biological marker of disease progression and severity in patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects over 20 million people globally. Notably, schizophrenia is associated with decreased density of dendritic spines and decreased levels of D-serine, a co-agonist required for opening of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). We hypothesized that lowered D-serine levels associated with schizophrenia would enhance ion flux-independent signaling by the NMDAR, driving destabilization and loss of dendritic spines. We tested our hypothesis using the serine racemase knockout (SRKO) mouse model, which lacks the enzyme for D-serine production. We show that activity-dependent spine growth is impaired in SRKO mice, but can be acutely rescued by exogenous D-serine. Moreover, we find a significant bias of synaptic plasticity toward spine shrinkage in the SRKO mice as compared to wild-type littermates. Notably, we demonstrate that enhanced ion flux-independent signaling through the NMDAR contributes to this bias toward spine destabilization, which is exacerbated by an increase in synaptic NMDARs in hippocampal synapses of SRKO mice. Our results support a model in which lowered D-serine levels associated with schizophrenia enhance ion flux-independent NMDAR signaling and bias toward spine shrinkage and destabilization.",

However, the functions of the remaining eight Toll-related proteins in Drosophila are not fully understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Toll-9 is necessary and sufficient for a special form of compensatory proliferation after apoptotic cell loss (undead apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP)). Mechanistically, for AiP, Toll-9 interacts with Toll-1 to activate the intracellular Toll-1 pathway for nuclear translocation of the NF-{kappa}B-like transcription factor Dorsal which induces expression of the pro-apoptotic genes reaper and hid. This activity contributes to the feedback amplification loop that operates in undead cells. Given that Toll-9 also functions in loser cells during cell competition, we define a general role of Toll-9 in cellular stress situations leading to the expression of pro-apoptotic genes which trigger apoptosis and apoptosis-induced processes such as AiP.

    "preprint_abstract": "Photoreceptors (PRs) are the primary visual sensory cells, and their loss leads to blindness that is currently incurable. Cell replacement therapy holds promise as a therapeutic approach to restore vision to those who have lost PRs through damage or disease. While PR transplant research is ongoing in animal models, success is hindered by our limited understanding of PR axon growth during development and regeneration. Using a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter line that labels PRs (WA09 CRX+/tdTomato), we generated retinal organoids in order to study mechanisms of PR process extension. We found that the earliest born PRs exhibit autonomous axon extension from dynamic terminals that appear similar to projection neuron growth cones. However, as hPSC-derived PRs age from 40 to 80 days of differentiation, they lose dynamic terminals in 2D plated cultures and within 3D retinal organoids, which does not correlate with cell birth date. Using a rod-specific hPSC reporter line (WA09 NRL+/eGFP), we further determined that rod PRs never form motile growth cones. Interestingly, PRs without motile terminals are still capable of extending axons, but neurites are generated from process stretching via their attachment to motile non-PR cells, which underlies the observed differences in PR neurite lengths on different substrata. While immobile PR terminals express actin, it is less polymerized and less organized than actin present in motile terminals. However, immobile PRs do localize synaptic proteins to their terminals, suggesting a normal developmental progression. These findings help inform the development of PR transplant therapies to treat blinding diseases and provide a platform to test treatments that restore autonomous PR axon extension.\n\nSignificance StatementLoss of photoreceptors (PRs) in the retina through damage or disease causes irreversible vision loss and blindness. One treatment approach is to replace lost cells with transplanted human stem cell-derived PRs, but this requires PR axons to integrate into the host retina to restore the required neural connections. For this strategy to succeed, we need to understand how PRs extend processes to their targets during development in situ, and whether dissociated human stem cell (hPSC)-derived PRs behave in a similar fashion. In this paper, we show that hPSC-PRs have only a short window during which they are capable of autonomous axon extension, which has implications for PR transplant efforts and for our basic understanding of human retinal development.",

In recent work we found that SPEN has an additional role in correct localisation of Xist RNA in cis, indicating that its contribution to chromatin-mediated gene silencing needs to be reappraised. Making use of a SPEN separation-of-function mutation we show that SPEN and Polycomb pathways in fact function in parallel to establish gene silencing. Additionally, we find that differentiation-dependent recruitment of the chromosomal protein SmcHD1 is required for silencing many X-linked genes.

The protoscolex that develops into the adult form in the definitive host is enveloped by a complex cellular syncytial tegument, where all metabolic interchange takes place. Little information is available as to the electrical activity of the parasite in this developmental stage. To gain insight into the electrical activity of the parasite at the larval stage, here we conducted microelectrode impalements of bovine lung protoscoleces (PSCs) of Echinococcus granulosus in normal saline solution. We observed two distinct intra-parasitic potentials, a transient peak potential and a stable second potential, most likely representing tegumental and intra-parasitic extracellular space electrical potential differences, respectively. These values changed upon the developmental status of the parasite, its anatomical regions, or time course after harvesting. Changes in electrical potential differences of the parasite provide an accessible and useful parameter for the study of transport mechanisms and potential targets for the development of novel antiparasitic therapeutics.\n\nAuthor summaryHydatid disease is a parasite-caused zoonosis that causes high morbidity and mortality and has a great impact on public health. The disease has no known cure, and the main lines of treatment include surgery and medical treatments which are not satisfactory, so new drug compounds are urgently needed. Genome sequencing of the parasite has identified different genes encoding ion channels in Echinococcus granulosus, making ion channel inhibitors a promising target for treating hydatidosis. However, no easy technical approaches are available to test the electrical contribution of ion channels to parasite physiology. In the present study, we used the microelectrode impalement technique to determine the electrical properties of the larval stages of the parasite harvested from infected cow lungs. We observed transient electrical potentials not previously reported for the parasite, and changes in these parameters associated with its developmental stage and aging. Our findings indicate that microelectrode impalement of protoscoleces of Echinococcus granulosus may be a strategy of choice to explore and test possible drugs suggested for their therapeutic potential against hydatid disease. Further evaluation of parasites coming from other animals and humans may help address important issues in the treatment and prevention of the hydatid disease.",

CAPN5 is partly membrane associated, despite its lack of a transmembrane domain. Unlike classical calpains, CAPN5 contains a C-terminal C2 domain. C2 domains often have affinity to lipids, mediating membrane association. We recently reported that the C2 domain of CAPN5 was essential for its membrane association and the activation of its autolytic activity. However, despite the removal of the C2 domain by autolysis, the N-terminal fragment of CAPN5 remained membrane associated. S-acylation, also referred to as S-palmitoylation, is a reversible post-translational lipid modification of cysteine residues that promotes membrane association of soluble proteins. In the present study several S-acylated cysteine residues were identified in CAPN5 with the acyl-PEG exchange method. Data reported here demonstrate that CAPN5 is S-acylated on up to three cysteine residues including Cys-4 and Cys-512, and likely Cys-507. The D589N mutation in a potential calcium binding loop within the C2 domain interfered with the S-acylation of CAPN5, likely preventing initial membrane association. Mutating specific cysteine residues of CAPN5 interfered with both its membrane association and the activation of CAPN5 autolysis. Taken together, our results suggest that the S-acylation of CAPN5 is critical for its membrane localization which appears to favor its enzymatic activity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Glucose transporter GLUT1 is ubiquitously expressed in the human body from the red cells to the blood-brain barrier to the skeletal muscles. It is physiologically relevant to understand how GLUT1 facilitates diffusion of glucose across the cell membrane. It is also pathologically relevant because GLUT1 deficiency causes neurological disorders and anemia and because GLUT1 overexpression fuels the abnormal growth of cancer cells. This article presents a quantitative investigation of GLUT1 based on all-atom molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of the transporter embedded in lipid bilayers of asymmetric inner-and-outer-leaflet lipid compositions, subject to asymmetric intra-and-extra-cellular environments. This is in contrast with the current literature of MD studies that have not considered both of the aforementioned asymmetries of the cell membrane. The equilibrium (unbiased) dynamics of GLUT1 shows that it can facilitate glucose diffusion across the cell membrane without undergoing large-scale conformational motions. The Gibbs free-energy profile, which is still lacking in the current literature of GLUT1, quantitatively characterizes the diffusion path of glucose from the periplasm, through an extracellular gate of GLUT1, on to the binding site, and off to the cytoplasm. This transport mechanism is validated by the experimental data that GLUT1 has low water-permeability, uptake-efflux symmetry, and 10 kcal/mol Arrhenius activation barrier around 37{degrees}C.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT (or TABLE OF CONTENTS ENTRY)\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/787259v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@287ab0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ecd68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4fa531org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e63b4e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We illustrate from multiscale modeling how transmembrane proton flux couples within a POT protein to drive essential steps of the full functional cycle: 1) protonation of a glutamate on transmembrane helix (TM) 7 opens the extracellular gate, allowing ligand entry; 2) inward proton flow induces the cytosolic release of ligand by varying the protonation state of a second conserved glutamate on TM10; 3) proton movement between TM7 and TM10 is thermodynamically driven and kinetically permissible via water proton shuttling without the participation of ligand. Our results, for the first time, give direct computational confirmation for the alternating access model of POTs, and point to a quantitative multiscale kinetic picture of the functioning protein mechanism.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEProton-coupled peptide transporters (POTs) utilize transmembrane proton gradient to deliver small peptides and peptide-like drug molecules into cells. Despite extensive biochemical and structural studies, major question regarding protonation-induced shift from inward-facing state to outward-facing state remains obscure. Here, we report direct evidence through multiscale simulations that the extracellular salt bridge controls the outward-open conformational transition of POTs, and how proton influx through POTs couples ligand transport. The computational modeling also suggests a multiscale kinetic mechanism of POTs.",

In both systems, ripples are a consequence of excess length along the edge of a sheet. Through the use of both time-lapse videos of blooming lilies and still images of torn plastic sheets, we find that ripples in both systems are well-described by the scaling relationship [Formula], where a is amplitude, w is wavelength, and L is arc length. By approximating that the arc length is proportional to the wavelength, we recover a phenomenological relationship previously reported for self-similar ripple patterns, namely [&lt;]a[&gt;] {propto} [&lt;]w[&gt;]. Our observations imply that a broad class of systems in which morphological changes are driven by excess length along an edge will produce ripples described by [Formula].\n\nSignificance StatementEarly in the blooming process of Lilium casablanca flowers, large ripples appear in the edges of their petals. As blooming progresses, smaller ripples arise on top of the original ones. All ripples are characterized by three variables, an amplitude, a wavelength, and an arc length. Here, we derive an equation that relates these variables. To test the equation, we collect movies of blooming lilies. We find that the equation quantitatively describes single ripples in the petals. The equation is general, so it applies to all systems in which ripples arise by the same mechanism. To illustrate this point, we show that the equation holds for single ripples that appear at the edges of torn plastic sheets.",

    "preprint_abstract": "During neural development, progenitor cells generate different types of neurons in specific time windows. Despite the characterisation of many of the transcription factor networks involved in these differentiation events, the mechanism behind their temporal regulation is poorly understood. To address this question, we studied the temporal differentiation of the simple lateral floor plate (LFP) domain in the zebrafish spinal cord. LFP progenitors sequentially generate early-born Kolmer-Agduhr\" (KA\") interneurons and late-born V3 interneurons. Analysis using a Notch signalling reporter demonstrates that these cell populations have distinct Notch signalling profiles. Not only do V3 cells receive higher total levels of Notch response, but they collect this response over a longer duration compared to V3 cells. To test whether the duration of Notch signalling determines the temporal cell fate specification, we combined a transgene that constitutively activates Notch signalling in the ventral spinal cord with a heat shock inducible Notch signalling terminator to switch off Notch response at any given time. Sustained Notch signalling results in expanded LFP progenitors while KA\" and V3 interneurons fail to specify. Early termination of Notch signalling leads to exclusively KA\" cell fate, despite the high level of Notch signalling, whereas late attenuation of Notch signalling drives only V3 cell fate. This suggests that the duration of Notch signalling is instructive in cell fate specification. Interestingly, knockdown experiments reveal a role for the Notch ligand Jag2b in maintaining LFP progenitors and limiting their differentiation into KA\" and V3 cells. Our results indicate that Notch signalling is required for neural progenitor maintenance while a specific attenuation timetable defines the fate of the postmitotic progeny.",

Specifically, a movement-related beta decrease (MRBD) occurs before movement, and a post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) follows. We investigated how the MRBD and PMBR vary with movement speed. Individuals performed a task with blocks that generated longer reaction times (RTs) and shorter RTs (Slow and Fast blocks, respectively) while scalp-electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The timing of task events before movement was also modulated to generate blocks with certain and uncertain timing (Fixed and Varied blocks, respectively). Beta modulation was reduced in Slow blocks compared to Fast blocks (i.e., a less negative MRBD and less positive PMBR). For the movement certainty manipulation, we saw mixed behavioral and EEG results. Our primary findings align with previous work which has shown reduced movement-related beta modulation in patients with Parkinsons disease. We propose that a \"slowed movement state\", whether it is experimentally induced or a manifestation of Parkinsons disease bradykinesia, is represented through reduced beta dynamics. Altogether, the MRBD and PMBR may represent motor speed on a continuum with Parkinsons disease as an extreme example of slowed movement.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The main factors that determine eye colour are the amount of melanin concentrated in iris melanocytes, as well as the shape and distribution of melanosomes. Eye colour is highly variable in populations with European ancestry, in which eye colour categories cover a continuum of low to high quantities of melanin accumulated in the iris. A few polymorphisms in the HERC2/OCA2 locus in chromosome 15 have the largest effect on eye colour in these populations, although there is evidence of other variants in the locus and across the genome also influencing eye colour. To improve our understanding of the genetic loci determining eye colour, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in a Canadian cohort of European ancestry (N= 5,641) and investigated putative causal variants. Our fine-mapping results indicate that there are several candidate causal signals in the HERC2/OCA2 region, whereas other significant loci in the genome likely harbour a single causal signal (TYR, TYRP1, IRF4, SLC24A4). Furthermore, a short subset of the associated eye colour regions was colocalized with the gene expression or methylation profiles of cultured melanocytes (HERC2, OCA2), and transcriptome-wide association studies highlighted the expression of two genes associated with eye colour: SLC24A4 and OCA2. Finally, genetic correlations of eye and hair colour from the same cohort suggest high pleiotropy at the genome level, but locus-level evidence hints at several differences in the genetic architecture of both traits. Overall, we provide a better picture of how polymorphisms modulate eye colour variation, particularly in the HERC2/OCA2 locus, which may be a consequence of specific molecular processes in the iris melanocytes.\n\nAuthor SummaryEye colour differences among humans are the result of different amounts of melanin produced, as well as due to differences in the shape and distribution of the organelles in charge of producing melanin. Eye colour is a highly heritable trait, where several genes across the genome are involved in the process, but we currently do not fully understand which are the causal variants and how they modulate eye colour variation. By performing genome-wide association studies of eye colour across Canadian individuals of European ancestry, we identify several candidate causal signals in and near the gene OCA2, and one candidate signal in other genes, such as TYR, TYRP1, IRF4 and SLC24A4. Furthermore, we provide insights about how significant loci may modulate eye colour variation by testing for shared signals with polymorphisms associated with the expression of genes and DNA methylation. Overall, we provide a better picture of the genetic architecture of eye colour and the molecular mechanisms contributing to its variation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Although collective cell migration (CCM) is a highly coordinated and ordered migratory mode, perturbations in the form of mechanical waves appear even in 2D. These perturbations caused by the viscoelastic nature of cell rearrangement are involved in various biological processes, such as embryogenesis, wound healing and cancer invasion. The mechanical waves, as a product of the active turbulence occurred at low Reynolds number, represent an oscillatory change in cell velocity and the relevant rheological parameters. The velocity oscillations, in the form of forward and backward flows, are driven by: viscoelastic force, surface tension force, and traction force. The viscoelastic force represents a consequence of inhomogeneous distribution of cell residual stress accumulated during CCM. This cause-consequence relation is considered on a model system such as the cell monolayer free expansion. The collision of forward and backward flows causes an increase in cell packing density which has a feedback impact on the tissue viscoelasticity and on that base influences the tissue stiffness. The evidence of how the tissue stiffness is changed near the cell jamming is conflicting. To fill this gap, we discussed the density driven change in the tissue viscoelasticity by accounting for the cell pseudo-phase transition from active (contractile) to passive (non-contractile) state appeared near cell jamming in the rheological modeling consideration.",

The ratio of \"hydrophobic-hydrophilic\" and \"positive-negative charged\" residues at the inner LWI remains conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and play important role in regulating TRPV1 trafficking, localization and functions. Arg575 is an important residue as Arg575Asp mutant has reduced Capsaicin-sensitivity, surface expression, colocalization with lipid-raft markers, cell area, and increased cell lethality. This lethality is due to the disruption of the ratio between positive-negative charges there. Such lethality can be rescued by either using TRPV1-specfic inhibitor 5-IRTX or by restoring the positive-negative charge ratio at that position, i.e. by introducing Asp576Arg mutation in Arg575Asp backbone. We propose that Arg575Asp mutant confers TRPV1 in a \"constitutive-open-like\" condition.

    "preprint_abstract": "Sour beers produced by barrel-aging of conventionally fermented beers are becoming increasingly popular. However, as the intricate interactions between the wood, the microbes and the beer are still unclear, wood maturation often leads to inconsistent end products with undesired sensory properties. Previous research on industrial barrel-aging of beer suggests that beer parameters like the ethanol content and bitterness play an important role in the microbial community composition and beer chemistry, but their exact impact still remains to be investigated. In this study, an experimentally tractable lab-scale system based on an in-vitro community of four key bacteria (Acetobacter malorum, Gluconobacter oxydans, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus) and four key yeasts (Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Candida friedrichii, Pichia membranifaciens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that are consistently associated with barrel-aging of beer, was used to test the hypotheses that beer ethanol and bitterness impact microbial community composition and beer chemistry. Experiments were performed using different levels of ethanol (5.2 v/v%, 8 v/v% and 11 v/v%) and bitterness (13 ppm, 35 ppm and 170 ppm iso--acids), and beers were matured for 60 days. Samples were taken after 0, 10, 20, 30 and 60 days to monitor population densities and beer chemistry. Results revealed that all treatments and the maturation time significantly affected the microbial community composition and beer chemistry. More specifically, the ethanol treatments obstructed growth of L. brevis and G. oxydans and delayed fungal growth. The iso--acid treatments hindered growth of L. brevis and stimulated growth of P. membranifaciens, while the other strains remained unaffected. Beer chemistry was found to be affected by higher ethanol levels, which led to an increased extraction of wood-derived compounds. Furthermore, the distinct microbial communities also induced changes in the chemical composition of the beer samples, leading to concentration differences in beer- and wood-derived compounds like 4-ethyl guaiacol, 4-ethyl phenol, cis-oak lactone, vanillin, furfural and 5-methyl furfural. Altogether, our results indicate that wood-aging of beer is affected by biotic and abiotic parameters, influencing the quality of the final product. Additionally, this work provides a new, cost-effective approach to study the production of barrel-aged beers based on a simplified microbial community model.",

The purpose of this study was to replicate these symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice in the quest to advance the preclinical study of non-motor symptoms of MS. Male and female C57BL/6 mice exposed to a mild form of EAE were evaluated for the progression of clinical, behavioural, thermal, and inflammatory processes. We show higher susceptibility in females to EAE than males based on greater clinical score and cumulative disease index (CDI), fatigue-like and anxiety-like behaviours. Accordingly, infrared (IR) thermography indicated higher cutaneous temperature in females from post-induction days 12 to 23. Females also responded to EAE with greater splenic and adrenal gland weights than males as well as sex-specific changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These findings provide the first evidence of a sex-specific thermal response to immune-mediated demyelination, thus proposing a non-invasive assessment approach of the psychophysiological dynamics in EAE mice. The results are discussed in relation to the thermoregulatory correlates of fatigue and how endogenously elevated body temperature without direct heat exposure may be linked to psychomotor inhibition in patients with MS.",

Canonical functional systems, such as the default mode network, are well-known modules of the human brain and have been implicated in a large number of cognitive, behavioral and clinical processes. However, modules delineated in structural brain networks inferred from tractography generally do not recapitulate canonical functional systems. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that functional connectivity between regions in the same systems is not always underpinned by anatomical connections. As such, direct structural connectivity alone would be insufficient to characterize the functional modular organization of the brain. Here, we demonstrate that augmenting structural brain networks with models of indirect (polysynaptic) communication unveils a modular network architecture that more closely resembles the brains established functional systems. We find that diffusion models of polysynaptic connectivity, particularly communicability, narrow the gap between the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks by 20-60%, whereas routing models based on single efficient paths do not improve mesoscopic structure-function correspondence. This suggests that functional modules emerge from the constraints imposed by local network structure that facilitates diffusive neural communication. Our work establishes the importance of modeling polysynaptic communication to understand the structural basis of functional systems.",

SVR-based pipelines have been increasingly used for motion correction for T2-weighted fetal MRI since they allow more informed and detailed diagnosis of brain and body anomalies including congenital heart defects (Lloyd et al., 2019). Recently, fully automated rigid SVR reconstruction of the fetal brain in the atlas space was achieved in (Salehi et al., 2019) that used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmentation and pose estimation. However, these CNN-based methods have not yet been applied to the fetal trunk region. Meanwhile, the existing rigid and deformable SVR (DSVR) solutions (Uus et al., 2020) for the fetal trunk region are limited by the requirement of manual input as well the narrow capture range of the classical gradient descent based registration methods that cannot resolve severe fetal motion frequently occurring at the early gestational age (GA). Furthermore, in our experience, the conventional 2D slice-wise CNN-based brain masking solutions are reportedly prone to errors that require manual corrections when applied on a wide range of acquisition protocols or abnormal cases in clinical setting.\n\nIn this work, we propose a fully automated pipeline for reconstruction of the fetal thorax region for 21-36 weeks GA range T2-weighted MRI datasets. It includes 3D CNN-based intra-uterine localisation of the fetal trunk and landmark-guided pose estimation steps that allow automated DSVR reconstruction in the standard radiological space irrespective of the fetal trunk position or the regional stack coverage. The additional step for generation of the common template space and rejection of outliers provides the means for automated exclusion of stacks affected by low image quality or extreme motion. The pipeline was evaluated on a series of experiments including fetal MRI datasets and simulated rotation motion. Furthermore, we performed a qualitative assessment of the image reconstruction quality in terms of the definition of vascular structures on 100 early (median 23.14 weeks) and late (median 31.79 weeks) GA group MRI datasets covering 21 to 36 weeks GA range.",

Malathion has been widely used against the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum Herbst. in stored products although no longer used. Malathion specific resistance in this pest has provided resistance that is long lasting and widely distributed. To understand this resistance a malathion resistant strain was challenged with a range of stressors including starvation, hyperoxia, malathion and a pathogen and the antioxidant responses and some lifecycle parameters were determined.\n\nAdult life span of malathion-specific resistant strain of T. castaneum was significantly shorter than the susceptible. Starvation and/or high oxygen reduced adult life span of both strains. Starving with and without 100% oxygen gave longer lifespan for the resistant strain, but for oxygen alone there was no difference. Under oxygen the proportional survival of the resistant strain to the adult stage was significantly higher, for both larvae and pupae, than the susceptible. The resistant strain when stressed with malathion and/or oxygen significantly increased catalase activity, but the susceptible did not. The resistant strain stressed with Paranosema whitei infection had significantly higher survival compared to the susceptible, and with almost no mortality.\n\nThe malathion resistant strain of T. castaneum showed greater vigour than the susceptible in most oxidative stress situations and especially where stressors were combined. The induction of the antioxidant enzyme catalase could have helped the resistant strain to withstand oxidative stresses, including insecticidal and importantly those from pathogens. These adaptations, in the absence of insecticide, seem to support the increased immunity of host insects to pathogens seen in other insect species, such as mosquitoes. By increasing the responses to a range of stressors the resistant strain could be considered as having enhanced fitness.",

Despite their growing promise, the integrated proteo-transcriptomic landscape of EVs and their donor cells remain poorly understood. To assess their cargo, we conducted small RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of EVs isolated from in vitro cancer cell culture and prostate cancer patients serum. Here, we report that EVs enrich for distinct molecular cargo, and their proteo-transcriptome is predominantly different from their cancer cell of origin, implicating a coordinated disposal and delivery mechanism. We have discovered that EVs package their cargo in a non-random fusion, as their most enriched RNAs and proteins are not the most abundant cargo from their donor cells. We show that EVs enrich for 4 times more cytoskeletal and 2 times extracellular proteins than their donor cells. While the donor cells carry 10 times more mitochondrial and 3 times nuclear proteins than their EVs. EVs predominantly (40-60%) enrich for small RNA (~15-200 nucleotides) molecules that implicate cell differentiation, development, and signaling signatures. Finally, our integrated proteo-transcriptomic analyses reveal that EVs are enriched of RNAs (RNY3, vtRNA, and MIRLET-7) and their complementary proteins (YBX1, IGF2BP2, SRSF1/2), implicating an interrelated mechanism that may protect and regulate transcripts until a biological function is achieved.

Intensification of production, however, increases the risk of disease outbreaks and thus the likelihood for crop losses. The microbial communities that colonise the skin mucosal surface of fish are poorly understood, but are important in maintaining fish health and resistance against disease. This skin microbial community is susceptible to disruption through stressors associated with transport, handling and the environment of intensive practices, and this risks the propagation of disease-causing pathogens. In this study, we characterised the microbial assemblages found on tilapia skin -- the most widely farmed finfish globally -- and in the surrounding water of seven earthen aquaculture ponds from two pond systems in distinct geographic regions in Malawi. Metabarcoding approaches were used to sequence the prokaryotic and microeukaryotic communities. We found 92% of prokaryotic amplicon sequence variants were common to both skin and water samples. Differentially enriched and core taxa, however, differed between the skin and water samples. In tilapia skin, Cetobacterium, Paucibacter, Pseudomonas and Comamonadaceae were enriched, whereas, the cyanobacteria Cyanobium, Microcystis and/or Synechocystis, and the diatom Cyclotella, were most prevalent in pond water. Ponds that clustered together according to their water prokaryotic communities also had similar microeukaryotic communities indicating strong environmental influences on prokaryotic and microeukaryotic community structures. While strong site-specific clustering was observed in pond water, the grouping of tilapia skin prokaryotes by pond site was less distinct, suggesting fish microbiota have a greater buffering capacity against environmental influences. The characterised diversity, structure and variance of microbial communities associated with tilapia culture in Malawi provide the baseline for studies on how future intensification practices may lead to microbial dysbiosis and disease onset.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFish skin and pond water communities differ structurally, but share common taxa\nC_LIO_LIPond locations have a stronger influence on water versus fish skin microbiome community structure\nC_LIO_LISelected skin-associated taxa could be used to monitor dysbiotic events in aquaculture\nC_LIO_LITaxa with opportunistic pathogen potential were identified at low abundance\nC_LI",

However, head motion during MRI acquisition is detrimental to both functional and structural MRI scan quality. Though infants are commonly scanned while asleep, they commonly exhibit motion during scanning, causing data loss. Our group has shown that providing MRI technicians with real-time motion estimates via Framewise Integrated Real-Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) software helps obtain high-quality, low motion fMRI data. By estimating head motion in real time and displaying motion metrics to the MR technician during an fMRI scan, FIRMM can improve scanning efficiency. Hence, we compared average framewise displacement (FD), a proxy for head motion, and the amount of usable fMRI data (FD [&le;] 0.2mm) in infants scanned with (n = 407) and without FIRMM (n = 295). Using a mixed-effects model, we found that the addition of FIRMM to current state-of-the-art infant scanning protocols significantly increased the amount of usable fMRI data acquired per infant, demonstrating its value for research and clinical infant neuroimaging.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The pelagic tunicates, gelatinous zooplankton that include salps, doliolids, and appendicularians, are filter feeding grazers thought to produce a significant amount of particulate organic carbon (POC) detritus. However, traditional sampling methods (i.e., nets), have historically underestimated their abundance, yielding an overall underappreciation of their global biomass and contribution to ocean biogeochemical cycles relative to crustacean zooplankton. As climate change is projected to decrease the average plankton size and POC export from traditional plankton food webs, the ecological and biogeochemical role of pelagic tunicates may increase; yet, pelagic tunicates were not resolved in the previous generation of global earth system climate projections. Here we present a global ocean study using a coupled physical-biogeochemical model to assess the impact of pelagic tunicates in the pelagic food web and biogeochemical cycling. We added two tunicate groups, a large salp/doliolid and a small appendicularian to the NOAA-GFDL Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry, and Lower Trophics version 2 (COBALTv2) model, which was originally formulated to represent carbon flows to crustacean zooplankton. The new GZ-COBALT simulation was able to simultaneously satisfy new pelagic tunicate biomass constraints and existing ecosystem constraints, including crustacean zooplankton observations. The model simulated a global tunicate biomass of 0.10 Pg C, annual tunicate production of 0.49 Pg C y-1 in the top 100 m, and annual tunicate detritus production of 0.98 Pg C y-1 in the top 100 m. Tunicate-mediated export flux was 0.71 Pg C y-1, representing 11% of the total export flux past 100 m. Overall export from the euphotic zone remained largely constant, with the GZ-COBALT pe-ratio only increasing 5.3% (from 0.112 to 0.118) compared to the COBALTv2 control. While the bulk of the tunicate-mediated export production resulted from the rerouting of phytoplankton- and mesozooplankton-mediated export, tunicates also shifted the overall balance of the upper oceans away from recycling and towards export. Our results suggest that pelagic tunicates play important trophic roles in both directly competing with microzooplankton and indirectly shunting carbon export away from the microbial loop.",

To what extent R-loop abundance and genome-wide localization is actively regulated during metazoan embryogenesis is unknown. Drosophila embryogenesis provides a powerful system to address these questions due to its well-characterized developmental program, the sudden onset of zygotic transcription and available genome-wide ChIP and transcription data sets. Here, we measure the overall abundance and genome localization of R-loops in early and late-stage embryos relative to Drosophila cultured cells. We demonstrate that absolute R-loop levels change during embryogenesis and that resolution of R-loops is critical for embryonic development. R-loop mapping by strand-specific DRIP-seq reveals that R-loop localization is plastic across development, both in the genes which form R-loops and where they localize relative to gene bodies. Importantly, these changes are not driven by changes in the transcriptional program. Negative GC skew and absolute changes in AT skew are associated with R-loop formation in Drosophila. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while some chromatin binding proteins and histone modification such as H3K27me3 are associated with R-loops throughout development, other chromatin factors associated with R-loops in a developmental specific manner. Our findings highlight the importance and developmental plasticity of R-loops during Drosophila embryogenesis.",

To survive in the environment and spread to new hosts, C. difficile must form metabolically-dormant spores. The formation of spores requires activation of the transcription factor Spo0A, which is the master regulator of sporulation in all endospore-forming bacteria. Though the sporulation initiation pathway has been delineated in the Bacilli, including the model spore-former Bacillus subtilis, the direct regulators of Spo0A in C. difficile remain undefined. C. difficile Spo0A shares highly conserved protein interaction regions with the B. subtilis sporulation proteins Spo0F and Spo0A, although many of the interacting factors present in B. subtilis are not encoded in C. difficile. To determine if comparable Spo0A residues are important for C. difficile sporulation initiation, site-directed mutagenesis was performed at conserved receiver domain residues and the effects on sporulation were examined. Mutation of residues important for homodimerization and interaction with both positive and negative regulators of B. subtilis Spo0A and Spo0F impacted C. difficile Spo0A function. The data also demonstrated that mutation of many additional conserved residues altered C. difficile Spo0A activity, even when the corresponding Bacillus interacting proteins are not apparent in the C. difficile genome. Finally, the conserved aspartate residue at position 56 of C. difficile Spo0A was determined to be the phosphorylation site that is necessary for Spo0A activation. The finding that Spo0A interacting motifs maintain functionality suggests that C. difficile Spo0A interacts with yet unidentified proteins that regulate its activity and control spore formation.",

The limitation of developing a successful therapy is due to the lack of molecules that synergistically facilitate folding by targeting distinct structural defects of {Delta}F508-CFTR. To improve drug efficacy by targeting the {Delta}F508-NBD1 folding and stability, and to study potential {Delta}F508-NBD1 allosteric corrector binding sites at the atomic level, we combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments. These methods allowed us to describe unfolding intermediates and forces acting during NBD1 mechanical unfolding and to elucidate the stabilization mechanism of {Delta}F508-NBD1 by 5-bromoindole-3-acetic acid (BIA). An NBD1 region, including the -subdomain, was identified as a potentially important participant of the first folding steps, characterized by non-native interactions of F508, thus destabilized in the deletion mutant. The instability was counteracted by the low-potency corrector BIA, increasing the mechanical resistance of the {Delta}F508-NBD1 -subdomain, which was confirmed as a binding site by computational modeling and HDX experiments. Our results underline the complementarity of computational and experimental methods and provide a possible strategy to improve folding correctors.",

Its host immune evasion strategy is mediated by pore-forming toxins (PFTs), among which the bicomponent {gamma}-hemolysin is one of the most common. The complexity of the porogenesis mechanism by {gamma}-hemolysin poses difficulties in the development of antivirulence therapies targeting PFTs from S. aureus, and sparse and apparently contrasting experimental data have been produced. Here, through a large set of molecular dynamics simulations at different levels of resolution, we investigate the first step of pore formation, and in particular the effect of membrane composition on the ability of{gamma} -hemolysin components, LukF and Hlg2, to steadily adhere to the lipid bilayer in the absence of proteinaceous receptors. Our simulations are in agreement with experimental data of {gamma}-hemolysin pore formation on model membranes, which are here explained on the basis of the bilayer properties. Our computational investigation suggests a possible rationale to explain experimental data on phospholipid binding to the LukF component, and to hypothesise a mechanism by which, on purely lipidic bilayers, the stable anchoring of LukF to the cell surface facilitates Hlg2 binding, through the exposure of its N-terminal region. We expect that further insights on the mechanism of transition between soluble and membrane bound-forms and on the role played by the lipid molecules will contribute to the design of antivirulence agents with enhanced efficacy against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/479512v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f0ae5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c46688org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1277e17org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c71898_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe presence of cholesterol and unsaturated phospholipid tails facilitates the binding of{gamma} -hemolysin components, LukF and Hlg2, on model membranes.\nC_LIO_LICoarse-grained simulations show that the two components have different absorption capabilities, with LukF undergoing the most stable binding.\nC_LIO_LIThe spontaneous docking of LukF on the membrane is mediated by two distant phosphatidylcholine binding sites.\nC_LI",

It adds an orthogonal spectral dimension to the traditional hydrodynamic characterization by exploiting unique chromophores in analyte mixtures that may or may not interact. Here we illustrate the utility of MW-AUC for representative classes of challenging biopolymer systems, including interactions between mixtures of different sized proteins with small molecules, mixtures of loaded and empty viral AAV capsids contaminated with free DNA, and mixtures of different proteins, where some have identical hydrodynamic properties, all of which are difficult to resolve with traditional AUC methods. We explain the improvement in resolution and information content obtained by this technique compared to traditional single- or dual-wavelength approaches. We discuss experimental design considerations and limitations of the method, and address the advantages and disadvantages of the two MW optical systems available today, and the differences in data analysis strategies between the two systems.",

In fibrosis, the composition and the organization of the ECM are altered, and these changes influence cellular behaviour. Biochemical (i. e. protein composition) and biomechanical changes in ECM take place simultaneously in vivo. Investigating these changes individually in vitro to examine their (patho)physiological effects has been difficult. In this study, we generated an in vitro model to reflect the altered mechanics of a fibrotic microenvironment through applying fibre crosslinking via ruthenium/sodium persulfate crosslinking on native lung ECM-derived hydrogels. Crosslinking of the hydrogels without changing the biochemical composition of the ECM resulted in increased stiffness and decreased viscoelastic stress relaxation. The altered stress relaxation behaviour was explained using a generalized Maxwell model. Fibre analysis of the hydrogels showed that crosslinked hydrogels had a higher percentage of matrix with a high density and a shorter average fibre length. Fibroblasts seeded on ruthenium-crosslinked lung ECM-derived hydrogels showed myofibroblastic differentiation with a loss of spindle-like morphology together with greater -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) expression, increased nuclear area and circularity without any decrease in the viability, compared with the fibroblasts seeded on the native lung-derived ECM hydrogels. In summary, ruthenium crosslinking of native ECM-derived hydrogels provides an exciting opportunity to alter the biomechanical properties of the ECM-derived hydrogels while maintaining the protein composition of the ECM to study the influence of mechanics during fibrotic lung diseases.",

Prior work has attempted to determine how alterations in white matter (WM) relate to changes in symptom severity, but much of that work has been done in smaller cross-sectional samples using voxel-based analyses. Using standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods, we previously showed WM alterations were associated with ADHD symptom remission over time in a longitudinal sample of probands, siblings, and unaffected individuals. Here, we extend this work by further assessing the nature of these changes in WM microstructure by including an additional follow-up measurement (aged 18 - 34 years), and using the more physiologically informative fixel-based analysis (FBA).\n\nMethodsData were obtained from 139 participants over 3 clinical and 2 follow-up DWI waves, and analyzed using FBA in regions-of-interest based on prior findings. We replicated previously reported significant models and extended them by adding another time-point, testing whether changes in combined ADHD and hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) continuous symptom scores are associated with fixel metrics at follow-up.\n\nResultsClinical improvement in HI symptoms over time was associated with more fiber density at follow-up in the left corticospinal tract (lCST) (tmax=1.092, standardized effect[SE]=0.044, pFWE=0.016). Improvement in combined ADHD symptoms over time was associated with more fiber cross-section at follow-up in the lCST (tmax=3.775, SE=0.051, pFWE=0.019). Conclusions: Aberrant white matter development involves both lCST micro- and macrostructural alterations, and its path may be moderated by preceding symptom trajectory.",

PDAC cells adapt their metabolism efficiently to the environment to which they are exposed, often relying on diverse fuel sources depending on availability. Since traditional experimental techniques appear exhaustive in the search for a viable therapeutic strategy against PDAC, in this study, a highly curated and omics-informed genome-scale metabolic model of PDAC was reconstructed using patient-specific transcriptomic data. From the analysis of the model-predicted metabolic changes, several new metabolic functions were explored as potential therapeutic targets against PDAC in addition to the already known metabolic hallmarks of pancreatic cancer. Significant downregulation in the peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation pathway reactions, flux modulation in the carnitine shuttle system, and upregulation in the reactive oxygen species detoxification pathway reactions were observed. These unique metabolic traits of PDAC were then correlated with potential drug combinations that can be repurposed for targeting genes with poor prognosis in PDAC. Overall, these studies provide a better understanding of the metabolic vulnerabilities in PDAC and will lead to novel effective therapeutic strategies.\n\nAuthor summaryPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer, with late diagnosis, early metastasis, insufficient therapy response, and very low survival rates. Due to these challenges associated with the diagnosis and treatment of PDAC, it has been a research area of interest. With the goal of understanding the metabolic reprogramming in proliferating PDAC cells, we reconstructed healthy and PDAC models by incorporating patient transcriptomic data into a genome-scale global human metabolic model. Comparing the metabolic flux space for the reactions in the two context-specific models, we identified significantly divergent pathways in PDAC. These results allowed us to further investigate growth-limiting genes in PDAC and identify potential drug combinations that can be repositioned for treatment of PDAC.",

Variation in XCI across the placenta may contribute to observed sex differences and variability in pregnancy outcomes. However, XCI has predominantly been studied in human adult tissues. Here we sequenced and analyzed DNA and RNA from two locations from 30 full-term pregnancies. Implementing an allele specific approach to examine XCI, we report evidence that XCI in the human placenta is patchy, with large patches of either silenced maternal or paternal X chromosomes. Further, using similar measurements, we show that this is in contrast to adult tissues, which generally exhibit mosaic X-inactivation, where bulk samples exhibit both maternal and paternal X chromosome expression. Further, by comparing skewed samples in placenta and adult tissues, we identify genes that are uniquely silenced or expressed in the placenta compared to adult tissues highlighting the need for tissue-specific maps of XCI.",

If engineered for improved safety, direct infusion of viral gene transfer vectors to initiate in vivo CAR-T transduction, expansion and anti-tumor activity could provide an alternative, universal approach. To explore this approach we administered approximately 20 million replication-incompetent VSV-G lentiviral particles carrying an anti-CD19CAR-2A-GFP transgene comprising either an FMC63 (human) or 1D3 (murine) anti-CD19 binding domain, or a GFP-only control transgene, to wild-type C57BL/6 mice by tail vein infusion. The dynamics of immune cell subsets isolated from peripheral blood were monitored at weekly intervals. We saw emergence of a persistent CAR-transduced CD3+ T cell population beginning week 3-4 that reached a maximum of 13.5 +/-0.58% (mean +/-SD) and 7.8 +/-0.76% of the peripheral blood CD3+ T cell population in mice infused with ID3-CAR or FMC63-CAR lentivector, respectively, followed by a rapid decline in each case of the B cell content of peripheral blood. Complete B cell aplasia was apparent by week 5 and was sustained until the end of the protocol (week 8). No significant CAR positive populations were observed within other immune cell subsets or other tissues. These results indicate that direct IV infusion of conventional VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral particles carrying a CD19 CAR transgene can transduce T cells that then fully ablate endogenous B cells in wild type mice.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Estimating tumor purity is especially important in the age of precision medicine. Purity estimates have been shown to be critical for correction of tumor sequencing results, and higher purity samples allow for more accurate interpretations from next-generation sequencing results. In addition, tumor purity has been shown to be correlated with survival outcomes for several diseases. Molecular-based purity estimates using computational approaches require sequencing of tumors, which is both time-consuming and expensive. Here we propose an approach, weakly-supervised purity (wsPurity), which can accurately quantify tumor purity within a slide, using multiple and different types of cancer. This approach allows for a flexible analysis of tumors from whole slide imaging (WSI) of histology hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Our model predicts tumor type with high accuracy (greater than 80% on an independent test cohort), and tumor purity at a higher accuracy compared to a comparable fully-supervised approach (0.1335 MAE on an independent test cohort). In addition to tumor purity prediction, our approach can identify high resolution tumor regions within a slide, to enrich tumor cell selection for downstream analyses. This model could also be used in a clinical setting, to stratify tumors into high and low tumor purity, using different thresholds, in a cancer-dependent manner, depending on what purity levels correlate with worse disease outcomes. In addition, this approach could be used in clinical practice to select the best tissue block for sequencing. Overall, this approach can be used in several different ways to analyze WSIs of tumor H&E sections.",

Here we investigate how electrophysiological mechanisms underlying attentional selection within working memory differ during primary task resumption between younger and older adults. Participants performed a working memory task, while being frequently interrupted with either a cognitively low- or high-demanding arithmetic task. Afterwards, a retrospective cue (retro-cue) indicated the working memory content required for later report. The detrimental effect of the interruption was evident in both age groups, but while younger adults were more strongly affected by a high-than by a low-demanding interruption, the performance deficit appeared independently of the cognitive requirements of the interruption task in older adults. A similar pattern was found regarding frontal-posterior connectivity in the theta frequency range, suggesting that aging decreases the ability to selectively maintain relevant information within working memory. The power of mid-frontal theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) featured a comparable effect of interruptions in both age groups. How-ever, posterior alpha power (8-14 Hz) following the retro-cue was more diminished by a preceding interruption in older adults. These results suggest an age-related deficit in the atten-tional selection and maintenance of primary task information following an interruption that appeared independent from the cognitive requirements of the interrupting task.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the sensory modality used to identify the position of proprioceptive targets hidden from sight, but frequently viewed, influences the type of the body representation employed for reaching them with the finger. The question then arises as to whether this observation also applies to proprioceptive targets which are hidden from sight, and rarely, if ever, viewed. We used an established technique for pinpointing the type of body representation used for the spatial encoding of targets which consisted of assessing the effect of peripheral gaze fixation on the pointing accuracy. More precisely, an exteroceptive, visually dependent, body representation is thought to be used if gaze deviation induces a deviation of the pointing movement. Three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were positioned at the participants eye level at -25 deg, 0 deg and +25 deg with respect to the cyclopean eye. Without moving the head, the participant fixated the lit LED before the experimenter indicated one of the three target head positions: topmost point of the head (vertex) and two other points located at the front and back of the head. These targets were either verbal-cued or tactile-cued. The goal of the subjects (n=27) was to reach the target with their index finger. We analysed the accuracy of the movements directed to the topmost point of the head, which is a well-defined, yet out of view anatomical point. Based on the possibility of the brain to create visual representations of the body areas that remain out of view, we hypothesized that the position of the vertex is encoded using an exteroceptive body representation, both when verbally or tactile-cued. Results revealed that the pointing errors were biased in the opposite direction of gaze fixation for both verbal-cued and tactile-cued targets, suggesting the use of a vision-dependent exteroceptive body representation. The enhancement of the visual body representations by sensorimotor processes was suggested by the greater pointing accuracy when the vertex was identified by tactile stimulation compared to verbal instruction. Moreover, we found in a control condition that participants were more accurate in indicating the position of their own vertex than the vertex of other people. This result supports the idea that sensorimotor experiences increase the spatial resolution of the exteroceptive body representation. Together, our results suggest that the position of rarely viewed body parts are spatially encoded by an exteroceptive body representation and that non-visual sensorimotor processes are involved in the constructing of this representation.",

Diffusion MRI allows the characterisation of subtle inter-individual differences in structural brain connectivity. Individual brain connectivity maps (connectomes) are by nature high in dimensionality and are complex to interpret. Machine learning methods are a powerful tool to uncover properties of the connectome which are not readily visible, and can give us clues as to how and why individual developmental trajectories differ.\n\nIn this manuscript we used Deep Neural Networks and Random Forests to predict demographic and neurodevelopmental characteristics from neonatal structural connectomes in a large sample of babies (n = 524) from the developing Human Connectome Project. We achieved an accurate prediction of post menstrual age (PMA) at scan in term-born infants (Mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.72 weeks, r = 0.83 and p<0.001). We also achieved good accuracy when predicting gestational age at birth in a cohort of term and preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age (MAE = 2.21 weeks, r = 0.82, p<0.001). We subsequently used sensitivity analysis to obtain feature relevance from our prediction models, with the most important connections for prediction of PMA and GA found to be predominantly thalamocortical. From our models of PMA at scan for infants born at term, we computed a brain maturation index (predicted age minus actual age) of individual preterm neonates and found a significant correlation between this index and motor outcome at 18 months corrected age. Our results demonstrate the applicability of machine learning techniques in analyses of the neonatal connectome, and suggest that a neural substrate for later developmental outcome is detectable at term equivalent age.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Base rate neglect refers to peoples apparent tendency to underweight or even ignore base rate information when estimating posterior probabilities for events, such as the probability that a person with a positive cancer-test outcome actually does have cancer. While often replicated, almost all evidence for the phenomenon comes from studies that used problems with extremely low base rates, high hit rates, and low false alarm rates. It is currently unclear whether the effect generalizes to reasoning problems outside this \"corner\" of the entire problem space. Another limitation of previous studies is that they have focused on describing empirical patterns of the effect at the group level and not so much on the underlying strategies and individual differences. Here, we address these two limitations by testing participants on a broader problem space and modelling their responses at a single-participant level. We find that the empirical patterns that have served as evidence for base-rate neglect generalize to a larger problem space, albeit with large individual differences in the extent with which participants \"neglect\" base rates. In particular, we find a bi-modal distribution consisting of one group of participants who almost entirely ignore the base rate and another group who almost entirely account for it. This heterogeneity is reflected in the cognitive modeling results: participants in the former group were best captured by a linear-additive model, while participants in the latter group were best captured by a Bayesian model. We find little evidence for heuristic models. Altogether, these results suggest that the effect known as \"base-rate neglect\" generalizes to a large set of reasoning problems, but varies largely across participants and may need a reinterpretation in terms of the underlying cognitive mechanisms.",

Pulsed contractions driven by RhoA represent a generic mode of actomyosin contractility, but the mechanisms underlying (1) how their specific architecture emerges, and (2) how this architecture supports the contractile function of the network, remain unclear. Here, we combine quantitative microscopy, single-molecule imaging, numerical simulations and simple mathematical modelling, to explore the dynamic network architecture underlying pulsed contraction. We show that during pulsed contractions, two subpopulations of formins are recruited by RhoA from the cytoplasm and bind to the cell surface in the early C. elegans embryo: recruited formins, a functionally inactive population, and elongating formins, which actively participate in actin filaments elongation. Focusing on formin dynamics during pulses, we show that minority elongating formins precede recruited formins, a kinetic dynamics compatible with formins capturing and rapidly saturating barbed ends available for filament elongation. We then show that these elongating formins assemble a polar network of actin, with barbed ends pointing out of the pulse, pointing to a kinetic rather than mechanical control of network architecture. Finally, our numerical simulations demonstrate that this geometry favors rapid network contraction. Our results thus show that formins saturate available actin filaments barbed ends and convert a local, biochemical gradient of RhoA activity into a polar network architecture, thereby driving rapid and efficient network contractility, an important evolutionary feature in a metazoan with a rapid embryonic cell cycles.\n\nHO_SCPLOWIGHLIGHTSC_SCPLOWO_LIThe formin CYK-1 drives actin network assembly during RhoA-driven pulses\nC_LIO_LIThe process is extremely rapid, with a formin-based actin elongation rate higher than 1.3 m{middle dot}s-1\nC_LIO_LIA barbed-end saturation mechanism allows for responsive F-actin assembly\nC_LIO_LIRapid and responsive F-actin elongation results in the assembly of aster-like polar actin networks\nC_LIO_LINumerical simulations show network polarity drives very efficient network contractility\nC_LI",

In mouse auditory cortex, small neuronal networks encode behavioral choice during a pure-tone detection task, but it is poorly understood how neuronal networks encode behavioral choice during a pure-tone discrimination task where tones have to be categorized into targets and non-targets. While the interactions between networked neurons are thought to encode behavioral choice, it remains unclear how patterns of neuronal network activity indicate the transmission of task-relevant information within the network. To this end, we trained mice to behaviorally discriminate target vs. non-target pure-tones while we used in vivo 2-photon imaging to record neuronal population activity in primary auditory cortex layer 2/3. We found that during task performance, a specialized subset of neurons transiently encoded intersection information, i.e., sensory information that was used to inform behavioral choice. Granger causality analysis showed that these neurons formed functional networks in which task-relevant information was transmitted sequentially between neurons. Differences in network structure between target and non-target sounds encoded behavioral choice. Correct behavioral choices were associated with shorter timescale communication between neurons. In summary, we find that specialized neuronal populations in auditory cortex form functional networks during auditory task performance whose structures depend on both sensory input and behavioral choice.",

During claustral independent colony foundation (ICF) in several ants, the esophagus of the founding queen expands and develops into a thoracic crop, which is then filled with a liquid substrate for larval feeding. It has been suggested that these substrates are converted from her body reserves (e.g., histolyzed flight muscles) or redistributed from a gastral crop. Here, we examined thoracic crop development in Lasius japonicus during claustral ICF. The foundresses claustrally fed their larvae from week 2 to 5 after ICF onset, and the first worker emerged at week 6. The development proceeded as follows: in week 0, foundress dorsal esophagus wall was pleated and thickened. Then, from week 2 to 5, the esophagus expanded dorsally toward where flight muscles had been present, following flight muscle histolysis. Gastral crop expansion followed esophagus expansion. Thus, thoracic crop formation may be spatiotemporally coordinated with flight muscle histolysis in Lasius japonicus queens, and similar developmental regulations might be common in other claustral ICF ants.",

The loss of the SUZ12 N-terminus in the fusion protein disrupted interaction with the PRC2 accessory factors JARID2, EPOP and PALI1 and prevented recruitment of PRC2 from RNA to chromatin. In undifferentiated cells, JAZF1-SUZ12 occupied PRC2 target genes but gained a JAZF1-like binding profile during cell differentiation. JAZF1-SUZ12 reduced H3K27me3 and increased H4Kac at PRC2 target genes, and this was associated with disruption in gene expression and cell differentiation programs.

Here we used a rhesus macaque model of SIV/Mtb co-infection to study the early effects of acute SIV infection on CD4 T cells in pulmonary Mtb granulomas. Two weeks after SIV co-infection CD4 T cells were dramatically depleted from granulomas, before significant bacterial outgrowth, disease reactivation as measured by PET-CT imaging, or CD4 T cell loss in blood, airways, and lymph nodes. Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, CCR5-expressing, in granulomas were preferentially depleted by SIV infection. Moreover, CD4 T cells were preferentially depleted from the granuloma core and lymphocyte cuff relative to B cell-rich regions, and live imaging of granuloma explants showed that SIV co-infection reduced T cell motility.

    "preprint_abstract": "Multi-lineage development from gastruloids is enabling unprecedented opportunities to model and study human embryonic processes and is expected to accelerate ex vivo strategies in organ development. Reproducing human cardiogenesis with neurogenesis in a multi-lineage context remains challenging, requiring spatiotemporal input of paracrine and mechanical cues. Here we extend elongating multi-lineage organized (EMLO) gastruloids to include cardiogenesis (EMLOC) and describe interconnected neuro-cardiac lineages in a single gastruloid model. Contractile EMLOCs recapitulate numerous interlinked developmental features including heart tube formation and specialization, cardiomyocyte differentiation and remodeling phases, epicardium, ventricular wall morphogenesis, chamber-like structures and formation of a putative outflow tract. The EMLOC cardiac region, which originates anterior to gut tube primordium, is progressively populated by neurons in a spatial pattern mirroring the known distribution of neurons in the innervated human heart. This human EMLOC model represents the first multi-lineage advancement for the study of coincident neurogenesis and cardiogenesis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Despite the great success of the administered vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus can still spread, as evidenced by the current circulation of the highly contagious Omicron variant. This emphasizes the additional need to develop effective antiviral countermeasures. In the context of early preclinical studies for antiviral assessment, robust cellular infection systems are required to screen drug libraries. In this study, we reported the implementation of a human glioblastoma cell line, stably expressing ACE2, in a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay. These glioblastoma cells, designated as U87.ACE2+, expressed ACE2 and cathepsin B abundantly, but had low cellular levels of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. The U87.ACE2+ cells fused highly efficiently and quickly with SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells. Furthermore, upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus, the U87.ACE2+ cells displayed rapidly a clear CPE that resulted in complete cell lysis and destruction of the cell monolayer. By means of several readouts we showed that the U87.ACE2+ cells actively replicate SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the U87.ACE2+ cells could be successfully implemented in an MTS-based colorimetric CPE reduction assay, providing IC50 values for Remdesivir in the low nanomolar range. Lastly, the U87.ACE2+ cells were consistently permissive to all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the current Omicron variant. Thus, ACE2 expressing glioblastoma cells are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 with productive viral replication and with the induction of a strong CPE that can be utilized in high-throughput screening platforms.",

Developing a diverse drug portfolio will be critical for our ability to rapidly respond to novel coronaviruses (CoVs) and other viruses with pandemic potential. Here we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 conserved macrodomain (Mac1), a small domain of non-structural protein 3 (nsp3). Mac1 is an ADP-ribosylhydrolase that cleaves mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins, protects the virus from the anti-viral effects of host ADP-ribosyltransferases, and is critical for the replication and pathogenesis of CoVs. In this study, a luminescent-based high-throughput assay was used to screen [~]38,000 small molecules for those that could inhibit Mac1-ADP-ribose binding. We identified 5 compounds amongst 3 chemotypes that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mac1-ADP-ribose binding in multiple assays with IC50 values less than 100{micro}M, inhibit ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity, and have evidence of direct Mac1 binding.

    "preprint_abstract": "Reduced representation sequencing (RRS) is a widely used method to assay the diversity of genetic loci across the genome of an organism. The dominant class of RRS approaches assay loci associated with restriction sites within the genome (restriction site associated DNA sequencing, or RADseq). RADseq is frequently applied to non-model organisms since it enables population genetic studies without relying on well-characterized reference genomes. However, RADseq requires the use of many bioinformatic filters to ensure the quality of genotyping calls. These filters can have direct impacts on population genetic inference, and therefore require careful consideration. One widely used filtering approach is the removal of loci which do not conform to expectations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Despite being widely used, we show that this filtering approach is rarely described in sufficient detail to enable replication. Furthermore, through analyses of in silico and empirical datasets we show that some of the most widely used HWE filtering approaches dramatically impact inference of population structure. In particular, the removal of loci exhibiting departures from HWE after pooling across samples significantly reduces the degree of inferred population structure within a dataset (despite this approach being widely used). Based on these results, we provide recommendations for best practice regarding the implementation of HWE filtering for RADseq datasets.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Eusociality has evolved multiple times across the insect phylogeny. Social insects with greater levels of social complexity tend to exhibit specialized castes with low levels of individual phenotypic plasticity. In contrast, species with small, simple social groups may consist of totipotent individuals that can transition among behavioral and reproductive states as the social hierarchy shifts. However, recent work has shown that in some simple social groups, there can still be constraint on individual plasticity, caused by differences in maternal nourishment or initial social interaction. It is not well understood how and when these constraints arise during social evolution, ultimately leading to the evolution of nonreproductive workers. Some species of orchid bees can form social groups of a dominant and 1-2 subordinate helpers where all individuals are reproductive. Females can also disperse on emergence to start their own nest as a solitary foundress, which includes a nonreproductive nest guarding phase not typically expressed by subordinates. Little data exist to characterize the flexibility of orchid bees across these trajectories. Here, using the orchid bee Euglossa dilemma, we conduct an experiment assessing the plasticity of subordinate helpers, finding that they are highly flexible and capable of the behavioral, physiological, transcriptomic, and chemical changes seen in foundresses. Furthermore, we identify genes and gene networks associated with reproductive changes in E. dilemma that overlap with genes associated with worker physiology in eusocial species. Our results provide evidence that the lack of nonreproductive workers in E. dilemma is not due to a lack of subordinate plasticity.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among the most problematic opportunistic pathogens for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), causing repeated and resilient infections in the lung and surrounding airways. Evidence suggests that long-term infections are associated with diversification into specialized types but the underlying cause of that diversification and the effect it has on the persistence of infections remains poorly understood. Here, we use evolve and resequence experiments to investigate the genetic changes accompanying rapid, de novo phenotypic diversification in lab environments designed to mimic two aspects of human lung ecology: spatial structure and complex nutritional content. After [~]220 generations of evolution, we find extensive genetic variation present in all environments, including those that most closely resemble the CF lung, attributable to a combination of high mutation supply rates resulting from large population sizes and the complex ecological conditions imposed by resource complexity and spatial structure. We use the abundance and frequency of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations to estimate the ratio of mutations that are selectively neutral (hitchhikers) to those that are under selection (drivers). A significantly lower proportion of driver mutations in spatially structured populations suggests that reduced dispersal generates subpopulations with reduced effective population size, decreasing the supply of beneficial mutations and causing more divergent evolutionary trajectories. The genes most commonly mutated tend to impact regulatory functions linked to a range of CF-associated phenotypes, including one gene that confers antibiotic resistance despite the absence of antibiotic selection in our experiment, but do not appear to be specific to CF-like conditions arising from antimicrobial treatment, immune system suppression, or competition from other microbial species. Our results are consistent with models of adaptation that see the first mutations fixed during adaptation to a stressful environment being those that are broadly beneficial across a range of environments.",

Experimental investigations suggest that molecular motors interact with each other during the cellular transport, but the nature of such interactions remains not well understood. Stimulated by these observations, we present a theoretical study aimed to understand the effect of the range of interactions on dynamics of interacting molecular motors. For this purpose, we develop a new version of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes in which nearest-neighbor as well as the next nearest-neighbor interactions are taken into account in a thermodynamically consistent way. A theoretical framework based on a cluster mean-field approximation, which partially takes correlations into account, is developed to evaluate the stationary properties of the system. It is found that fundamental current-density relations in the system strongly depend on the strength and the sign of interactions, as well as on the range of interactions. For repulsive interactions stronger than some critical value, increasing the range of interactions leads to a change from unimodal to trimodal dependence in the flux-density fundamental diagram. Theoretical calculations are tested with extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations. Although in most ranges of parameters excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and computer simulations is observed, there are situations when the cluster mean-field approach fails to describe properly the dynamics in the system. Theoretical arguments to explain these observations are presented. Our theoretical analysis clarifies the microscopic picture of how the range of interactions influences the dynamics of interacting molecular motors.",

It is unknown whether this damage accumulation is species-dependant (via differing lifespans and hence cumulative exposures) or whether it can influence the progression of age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis. Peptide location fingerprinting (PLF) is a new proteomic analysis method, capable of the non-targeted identification of structure-associated changes within proteins. Here we applied PLF to publicly available ageing human IVD (outer annulus fibrosus), ageing mouse lung and human arterial atherosclerosis datasets and identified novel target proteins alongside common age-associated differences within protein structures which were conserved between tissue regions, organs, sexes and species and in age-related disease. We identify peptide yield differences across protein structures which coincide with biological regions, potentially reflecting the functional consequences of ageing or atherosclerosis for macromolecular assemblies (collagen VI and fibrin), enzyme/inhibitor activity (cathepsin B and alpha-2 macroglobulin), activation states (complement C3 and thrombin) and interaction states (laminins, perlecan, fibronectin, filamin-A, collagen XIV and apolipoprotein-B). Furthermore, we show that alpha-2 macroglobulin, prothrombin, collagen XIV and apolipoprotein-B all exhibit possible shared structural consequences in IVD ageing and arterial atherosclerosis, providing novel links between an age-related disease and intrinsic ageing. Crucially, we also demonstrate that fibronectin, laminin beta chains and filamin-A all exhibit conserved age-associated structural differences between mouse lung and human IVD, providing evidence that ECM, and their associating proteins, may be subjected to potentially similar mechanisms or consequences of ageing across species, irrespective of differences in lifespan and tissue function.",

However, newly evolved variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can reduce the efficacy of currently available antibodies and can diminish vaccine-induced immunity. Here, we demonstrate that the microscopic dynamics of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can be profoundly modified by the mutations present in the spike proteins of the SARS-COV-2 variants currently circulating in the world population. The dynamical perturbations within the antibody structure, which alter the thermodynamics of antigen recognition, are diverse and can depend both on the nature of the antibody and on the spatial location of the spike mutation. The correlation between the motion of the antibody and that of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) can also be changed, modulating binding affinity. Using protein-graph-connectivity networks, we delineated the mutant-induced modifications in the information-flow along allosteric pathway throughout the antibody. Changes in the collective dynamics were spatially distributed both locally and across long-range distances within the antibody. On the receptor side, we identified an anchor-like structural element that prevents the detachment of the antibodies; individual mutations there can significantly affect the antibody binding propensity. Our study provides insight into how virus neutralization by monoclonal antibodies can be impacted by local mutations in the epitope via a change in dynamics. This realization adds a new layer of sophistication to the efforts for rational design of monoclonal antibodies against new variants of SARS-CoV2, taking the allostery in the antibody into consideration.",

The use of disulphide constrained peptides to explore intracellular biological targets is limited by their lack of cell permeability and the instability of the disulphide bond in the reducing environment of the cell, loss of which results in abrogation of binding. To overcome these challenges, the cap-binding site interaction motif was placed in a hypervariable loop on an VH domain, and then selections performed to select a molecule that could recapitulate the interaction of the peptide with the target of interest in a process termed Peptide Epitope Linker Evolution (PELE). A novel VH domain was identified that interacted with the eIF4E cap binding site with a nanomolar affinity and that could be intracellularly expressed in mammalian cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated to specifically modulate eIF4E function by decreasing cap-dependent translation and cyclin D1 expression, common effects of eIF4F complex disruption.",

Because of its central importance in physiology, this transporter is tightly controlled by physical interactions with tissue-specific regulatory micropeptides that tune SERCA function to match changing physiological conditions. In the heart, phospholamban (PLB) inhibits SERCA, while dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) stimulates SERCA. These competing interactions determine cardiac performance by modulating the amplitude of Ca2+ signals that drive the contraction/relaxation cycle. The distinct functions of these peptides may relate to their reciprocal preferences for SERCA binding. While SERCA binds PLB more avidly at low cytoplasmic Ca2+, it binds DWORF better at high Ca2+. In the present study, we determined that this opposing Ca2+ sensitivity is due to preferential binding of DWORF and PLB to different intermediate conformations that the pump samples during the Ca2+ transport cycle. The results suggest a mechanistic basis for inhibitory and stimulatory micropeptide function. In addition, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements revealed dynamic shifts in SERCA-micropeptide binding equilibria during cellular Ca2+ elevations. The data suggest Ca2+-dependent dynamic exchange of inhibitory and stimulatory micropeptides from SERCA during the cardiac cycle. Together, these mechanisms provide beat-to-beat modulation of cardiac Ca2+ handling and contribute to the hearts adaptation to the increased physiological demands of exercise.\n\nO_TEXTBOXSignificance\n\nInteractions between SERCA and its regulatory micropeptides modulate cardiac performance.

Tight binding to different conformations of the pump may underly the distinct mechanistic functions of these regulators. Lower affinity during alternating phases of the cardiac cycle may drive dynamic exchange of inhibitory and stimulatory micropeptides during contraction and relaxation.

    "preprint_abstract": "Hypothalamic arginine vasopressin (AVP)-containing magnocellular neurosecretory neurons (AVPMNN) emit collaterals to synaptically innervate limbic regions influencing learning, motivational behaviour, and fear responses. Here, we characterize the dynamics of expression changes of two key determinants for synaptic strength, the postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins AMPAR subunit GluA1 and PSD scaffolding protein 95 (PSD95), in response to in vivo manipulations of AVPMNN neuronal activation state, or exposure to exogenous AVP ex vivo. Both long term water deprivation in vivo, which powerfully upregulates AVPMNN metabolic activity, and exogenous AVP application ex vivo, in brain slices, significantly increased GluA1 and PSD95 expression measured by western blot, in brain regions reportedly receiving direct ascending innervations from AVPMNN (i.e., ventral hippocampus, amygdala and lateral habenula). In contrast, the visual cortex, a region not observed to receive AVPMNN projections, showed no such changes. Ex vivo application of V1a and V1b antagonists to ventral hippocampal slices ablated the AVP stimulated increase in postsynaptic protein expression measured by western blot. Using a modified expansion microscopy technique, we were able to quantitatively assess the significant augmentation of PSD95 and GLUA1 densities in subcellular compartments in locus coeruleus tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive fibres, adjacent to AVP axon terminals. Our data strongly suggest that the AVPMNN ascending system plays a role in the regulation of the excitability of targeted neuronal circuits through upregulation of key post-synaptic density proteins corresponding to excitatory synapse.\n\nSupported by grantsUNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT-IN200121 & CONACYT-CB-238744 (LZ); CONACYT A1-S-8731 (LIE); MH002386, NIMH, NIH, USA (LEE)",

The presence of BSEs affects leaf hydraulics and photosynthetic rate. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) obscuravenosa (obv) mutant lacks BSEs. Here we identify the obv gene and the causative mutation, a non-synonymous amino acid change that disrupts a C2H2 zinc finger motif in a putative transcription factor. This mutation exists as a rare polymorphism in the natural range of wild tomatoes, but has increased in frequency in domesticated tomatoes, suggesting that the latter diversified into heterobaric and homobaric leaf types. The obv mutant displays reduced vein density, leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic assimilation rate. We show that these and other effects on plant development, including changes in leaf insertion angle, leaf margin serration, minor vein density and fruit shape, are controlled by OBV via changes in auxin signalling. Loss of function of the transcriptional regulator AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF4) also results in defective BSE development, revealing an additional component of a novel genetic module controlling aspects of leaf development important for ecological adaptation and subject to breeding selection.\n\nOne sentence summarydistribution of tomato heterobaric and homobaric leaves is controlled by a single-nucleotide polymorphism in an auxin-related transcription factor",

Association mapping revealed a shared significant peak on chromosome 5 (Chr5) where the PHT1;1/2/3 genes reside, suggesting a strong correlation between the regulation of Pi-uptake activity and PHT1 protein abundance. Genes encoding transcription factors, kinases, and a metalloprotease associated with both traits were also identified. Conditional GWAS followed by statistical analysis of genotype-dependent expression of PHT1;1 and transcription activity assays revealed an epistatic interaction between PHT1;1 and MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 52 (MYB52) on Chr1. Analyses of F1 hybrids generated by crossing two subgroups of natural accessions carrying specific SNPs associated with PHT1;1 and MYB52 further revealed the strong effects of potential variants on PHT1;1 expression and Pi uptake activity. Notably, the soil P contents in A. thaliana habitats were found to coincide with PHT1;1 haplotype, underscoring how fine-tuning of the activity of P acquisition by natural variants allows plants to adapt to their environments. This study sheds light on the complex regulation of P acquisition and offers a framework to systematically assess the effectiveness of GWAS approaches in the study of quantitative traits.\n\nOne sentence summaryStepwise GWAS analyses reveal insights into the genetic basis in regulating phosphorus acquisition and associations between the phosphate transporter PHT1;1 haplotype and Arabidopsis habitats.",

To examine the signals that gustatory neurons transmit and receive, we reconstructed gustatory axons and their synaptic sites in the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain, utilizing a whole-brain electron microscopy volume. We reconstructed 87 gustatory projections from the proboscis labellum in the right hemisphere and 57 from the left, representing the majority of labellar gustatory axons. Gustatory neurons contain a nearly equal number of interspersed pre-and post-synaptic sites, with extensive synaptic connectivity among gustatory axons. Morphology- and connectivity-based clustering revealed six distinct groups, likely representing neurons recognizing different taste modalities. The vast majority of synaptic connections are between neurons of the same group. This study resolves the anatomy of labellar gustatory projections, reveals that gustatory projections are segregated based on taste modality, and uncovers synaptic connections that may alter the transmission of gustatory signals.",

Despite its urgency, we still do not fully understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its ability to antagonize innate immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 leads to shutoff of cellular protein synthesis and over-expression of nsp1, a central shutoff factor in coronaviruses, inhibits cellular gene translation. However, the diverse molecular mechanisms nsp1 employs as well as its functional importance in infection are still unresolved. By overexpressing various nsp1 mutants and generating a SARS-CoV-2 mutant in which nsp1 does not bind ribosomes, we untangle the effects of nsp1. We uncover that nsp1, through inhibition of translation and induction of mRNA degradation, is the main driver of host shutoff during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we find the propagation of nsp1 mutant virus is inhibited specifically in cells with intact interferon (IFN) response as well as in-vivo, in infected hamsters, and this attenuation is associated with stronger induction of type I IFN response. This illustrates that nsp1 shutoff activity has an essential role mainly in counteracting the IFN response. Overall, our results reveal the multifaceted approach nsp1 uses to shut off cellular protein synthesis and uncover the central role it plays in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, explicitly through blockage of the IFN response.",

We tested whether activation of group III mGluRs by L-AP4 changes GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in two distinct dendritic spine-innervating GABAergic interneurons recorded in vitro in human neocortex. Calbindin-positive double bouquet cells (DBC) had columnar \"horsetail\" axons descending through layers II-V innervating dendritic spines (48%) and shafts, but not somata of pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons. Parvalbumin-expressing dendrite-targeting cell (PV-DTC) axons extended in all directions innervating dendritic spines (22%), shafts (65%) and somata (13%). As measured, 20% of GABAergic neuropil synapses innervate spines, hence DBCs, but not PV-DTCs, preferentially select spine targets. Group III mGluR activation paradoxically increased the frequency of sIPSCs in DBCs (to median 137% of baseline), but suppressed it in PV-DTCs (median 92%), leaving the amplitude unchanged. The facilitation of sIPSCs in DBCs may result from their unique GABAergic input being disinhibited via network effect. We conclude that dendritic spines receive specialised, diverse GABAergic inputs, and group III mGluRs differentially regulate GABAergic synaptic transmission to distinct GABAergic cell types in human cortex.",

However, the identity of the genes controlling citrate and spermine secretion remains mostly unknown despite their obvious relevance for progression to aggressive prostate cancer.\n\nMaterials & MethodsIn this study, we have correlated simultaneous measurement of citrate/spermine and transcriptomics data. We have refined these gene correlations in 12 prostate cancer cohorts containing 2915 tissue samples to create a novel gene signature of 150 genes connected with citrate and spermine secretion. We further explored the signature in public data, interrogating over 18 000 samples from various tissues and model systems, including 3826 samples from prostate and prostate cancer.\n\nResultsIn prostate cancer, the expression of this gene signature is gradually lost in tissue from normal epithelial cells through PIN, low grade (Gleason <= 7), high grade cancer (Gleason >= 8) and metastatic lesions. The accuracy of the signature is validated by its unique enrichment in prostate compared to other tissues, and its strong enrichment in epithelial tissue compartments compared to stroma. Several zinc-binding proteins that are not previously investigated in the prostate are present in the gene signature, suggesting new mechanisms for controlling zinc homeostasis in citrate/spermine secretion. However, the absence of the gene signature in all common prostate normal and cancer cell-lines, as well as prostate organoids, underlines the challenge to study the role of these genes during prostate cancer progression in model systems.\n\nConclusionsA large collection of transcriptomics data integrated with metabolomics identifies the genes related to citrate and spermine secretion in the prostate, and show that the expression of these genes gradually decreases on the path towards aggressive prostate cancer. In addition, the study questions the relevance of currently available model systems to study metabolism in prostate cancer development.",

In the non-primate mammalian retina, direction selectivity arises in starburst amacrine cell (SAC) dendrites, which provide selective inhibition to ON and ON-OFF direction selective retinal ganglion cells (dsRGCs)3,4. While SACs are present in primates5, their connectivity is unknown and the existence of primate dsRGCs remains an open question. Here we present a connectomic reconstruction of the primate ON SAC circuit from a serial electron microscopy volume of macaque central retina. We show that the structural basis for the SACs ability to compute and confer directional selectivity on post-synaptic RGCs6 is conserved in primates and that SACs selectively target a single ganglion cell type, a candidate homolog to the mammalian ON-sustained dsRGCs that project to the accessory optic system and contribute to gaze-stabilizing reflexes7,8. These results indicate that the capacity to compute motion direction is present in the retina, far earlier in the primate visual system than classically thought, and they shed light on the distinguishing features of primate motion processing by revealing the extent to which ancestral motion circuits are conserved.",

These cells receive synaptic inputs from over 100 anatomically-defined brain regions, which enables control from a distributed set of inputs across the brain. Extensive efforts have been made to map inputs to VTA cells based on neurochemical phenotype and output site. However, all of these studies have the same fundamental limitation that inputs local to the VTA cannot be properly assessed due to non-Cre-dependent uptake of EnvA-pseudotyped virus. Therefore, the quantitative contribution of local inputs to the VTA, including GABAergic, DAergic, and serotonergic, is not known. Here, we used a modified viral-genetic strategy that enables examination of both local as well as long-range inputs to VTADA cells. We found that nearly half of the total inputs to VTADA cells are located locally, revealing a substantial portion of inputs that have been missed by previous analyses. The majority of inhibition to VTADA cells arises from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, with large contributions from the VTA and the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to receiving inputs from VTAGABA neurons, DA neurons are connected with other DA neurons within the VTA as well as the nearby retrorubal field. Lastly, we show that VTADA neurons receive inputs from distributed serotonergic neurons throughout the midbrain and hindbrain, with the majority arising from the dorsal raphe. Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate combination of viral-genetic reagents to unmask the complexity of connectivity relationships to defined cells in the brain.",

The frog Rana temporaria secretes a family of closely related AMPs, temporins A-L, as an effective chemical dermal defence. The antibacterial potency of temporin L has been shown to increase synergistically in combination with both temporins B and A but this is modest. Here we show that the less potent temporin B enhances the cooperativity of the in vitro antibacterial activity of the more potent temporin L against EMRSA-15 and that this may be associated with an altered interaction with the bacterial plasma membrane, a feature critical for the antibacterial activity of most AMPs. Addition of buforin II, a histone H2A fragment, can further increase the cooperativity. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate temporins B and L readily form hetero-oligomers in models of Gram-positive bacterial plasma membranes. Patch-clamp studies show transmembrane ion conductance is triggered with lower amounts of both peptides and more quickly, when used in combination, but conductance is of a lower amplitude and pores are smaller. Temporin B may therefore act by forming temporin L/B hetero-oligomers that are more effective than temporin L homo-oligomers at bacterial killing and/or by reducing the probability of the latter forming until a threshold concentration is reached. Exploration of the mechanism of synergy between AMPs isolated from the same organism may therefore yield antibiotic combinations with advantageous pharmacodynamic properties.",

However, recently such studies have also been published with non-cleavable crosslinkers suggesting that MS-cleavability is not essential. We therefore examined in detail the advantages and disadvantages of using the most popular MS-cleavable crosslinker, DSSO. Indeed, DSSO gave rise to signature peptide fragments with a distinct mass difference (doublet) for nearly all identified crosslinked peptides. Surprisingly, we could show that it was not these peptide masses that proved the main advantage of MS-cleavability of the crosslinker, but improved peptide backbone fragmentation that allowed for more confident peptide identification. We also show that the more intricate MS3-based data acquisition approaches lack sensitivity and specificity, causing them to be outperformed by the simpler and faster stepped HCD method. This understanding will guide future developments and applications of proteome-wide crosslinking mass spectrometry.",

However, the role of HLMs in regulating desirable crop traits and the enzymes involved in these modifications are poorly understood. We studied the functions of tomato histone H3 lysine methyltransferases Set Domain Group 33 (SDG33) and SDG34 in biotic and abiotic stress responses. SDG33 and SDG34 mutants were altered in H3K36 and H3K4 methylations, and expression of genes involved in diverse processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli. The double but not the single mutants show resistance to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Interestingly, single mutants were tolerant to drought and the double mutant showed superior tolerance consistent with independent and additive functions. Mutants maintained higher water status during drought and improved recovery and survival after lapse of drought. Notably, diminution of H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation and expression of negative regulators in challenged plants contributes to stress tolerance of the mutants. Mutations in SDG33 and SDG34 remove predisposition to biotic and abiotic stress by disrupting permissive transcriptional context promoting expression of negative regulatory factors. These allows improvement of stress and pathogen tolerance through modification of histone epigenetic marks.",

In this manuscript, we report the use of microfluidic cantilevers in liquid with sub-nanogram scale weight sensing capability for the measurement of cellular mass changes of living single cells. With this instrumentation, we were able to perform fast mass measurements within 3 minutes. We show results of mass measurements of polystyrene and metal beads of various sizes (smallest weight measured at 280 {+/-} 95 pg) and live single-cell mass measurements in a physiologically relevant environment. We also performed finite element analysis to simulate and optimize the structural design and materials of cantilevers. Our simulation results indicate that using polymer materials, such as SU8 and polyimide, could improve the minimal detectable mass by 3-fold compared to conventional silicon cantilevers. The simulations also suggest that smaller dimensions of length, width, and thickness would improve the mass detection capability of microfluidic cantilevers.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bicarbonate secretion is a fundamental process involved in maintaining acid-base homeostasis. Disruption of bicarbonate entry into airway lumen, as has been observed in cystic fibrosis, produces several defects in lung function due to thick mucus accumulation. Bicarbonate is critical for correct mucin deployment and there is increasing interest in understanding its role in airway physiology, particularly in the initiation of lung disease in children affected by cystic fibrosis, in the absence of detectable bacterial infection. The current model of anion secretion in mammalian airways consists of CFTR and TMEM16A as apical anion exit channels, with limited capacity for bicarbonate transport compared to chloride. However, both channels can couple to SLC26A4 anion exchanger to maximise bicarbonate secretion. Nevertheless, current models lack any details about the identity of the basolateral protein(s) responsible for bicarbonate uptake into airway epithelial cells. We report herein that the electrogenic, sodium-dependent, bicarbonate cotransporter, SLC4A4, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of human and mouse airways, and that its pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing reduces bicarbonate secretion. In fully differentiated primary human airway cells, SLC4A4 inhibition induced an acidification of the airways surface liquid and markedly reduced the capacity of cells to recover from an acid load. Studies in the Slc4a4-null mice revealed a previously unreported lung phenotype, characterized by mucus accumulation and reduced mucociliary clearance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the reduction of SLC4A4 function induced a CF-like phenotype, even when chloride secretion remained intact, highlighting the important role SLC4A4 plays in bicarbonate secretion and mammalian airway function.",

Although the roles of these TFs are well understood in bilaterians, how their neural function evolved is unclear. Here, we use Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, a member of the early-branching phylum Cnidaria, to provide insight into this question. Using a combination of mRNA in situ hybridization, transgenesis, gene knockdown, transcriptomics, and in-vivo imaging, we provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular analysis of neurogenesis during embryogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration in this animal. We show that SoxB genes act sequentially. Stem cells expressing Piwi1 and Soxb1, which have a broad developmental potential, become neural progenitors that express Soxb2 before differentiating into mature neural cells. Knockdown of SoxB genes resulted in complex defects in embryonic neurogenesis. Hydractinia neural cells differentiate while migrating from the aboral to the oral end of the animal, but it is unclear whether migration per se or exposure to different microenvironments is the main driver of their fate determination. Our data constitute a rich resource for studies aiming at addressing this question, which is at the heart of understanding neurological disorders in all animals, including humans.",

We report that the monolayer thickness changes gradually in space and time by more than two folds in order to counterbalance the contraction and extension of the incompressible cytoplasm. We recapitulate these pulsatile dynamics using a continuum model and show that incorporation of cell stiffness dependent height variations is critical both for generating temporal pulsations and establishing the domain size.

In this study, the future impact of climate and land-use changes on Anatolian ground squirrels was assessed. Accordingly, a hierarchical approach with two steps was used. First, ecological niche modelling was used to assess the impact of climate change in areas accessible to Anatolian ground squirrels through dispersal (i.e. the impact of climate change). Second, based on the habitat preferences of ground squirrels, land-use data were used to assess the impact of land-use change in suitable bioclimatic areas for Anatolian ground squirrels under present and future conditions (i.e. the combined impact of both changes). Also, priority areas for the conservation of Anatolian ground squirrels were identified based on in-situ climate change refugia. This study represents a first attempt to combine niche modelling and land-use data for a species in Anatolia, one of the most vulnerable regions to the drivers of biodiversity loss, because it is the region where three of biodiversity hotspots meet, and interact. Habitat availability (i.e. suitable habitats across suitable bioclimatic areas) was projected to decline by 19-69% in the future (depending on the scenario), mainly due to the loss of suitable bioclimatic areas (47-77%, depending on the scenario) at lower elevations and in the western part of the central Anatolia and in the eastern Anatolia, suggesting that Anatolian ground squirrels will contract their range in the future, mainly due to climate change. Thus, in-situ climate change refugia were projected mainly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the central Anatolia, suggesting these regions as priority areas for the conservation of Anatolian ground squirrels.",

Although these functions are largely influenced by their taxonomic affiliation, the composition and spatial variability of planktonic protist communities remain poorly characterized in vast areas of the ocean. Here, we investigated the diversity of these communities in contrasting oceanographic conditions of the southwest Pacific sector (33-58{degrees}S) using DNA metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene. Seawater samples collected during twelve cruises (n = 482, 0-2000 m) conducted east of New Zealand were used to characterize protist communities in Subtropical (STW) and Subantarctic (SAW) water masses and the Subtropical Front (STF) that separates them. Diversity decreased with latitude and temperature but tended to be lowest in the STF. Sample ordination resulting from the abundance of amplicon single variants (ASVs) corresponded to the different water masses. Overall, Dinophyceae (34% of standardized total number of reads) and Chlorophyta (27%) co-dominated the euphotic zone, but their relative abundance and composition at class and lower taxonomic levels varied consistently between water masses. Among Chlorophyta, several picoplanktonic algae species of the Mamiellophyceae class including Ostreococcus lucimarinus dominated in STW, while the Chloropicophyceae species Chloroparvula pacifica was most abundant in SAW. Bacillariophyta (7%), Prymnesiophyceae (5%), and Pelagophyceae (3%) classes were less abundant but showed analogous water mass specificity at class and finer taxonomic levels. Protist community composition in the STF had mixed characteristics and showed regional differences with the southern STF (50{degrees}S) having more resemblance with subantarctic communities than the STF over the Chatham Rise region (42-44{degrees}S). Below the euphotic zone, Radiolaria sequences dominated the dataset (52%) followed by Dinophyceae (27%) and other heterotrophic groups like Marine Stramenopiles and ciliates (3%). Among Radiolaria, several unidentified ASVs assigned to Spumellarida were most abundant, but showed significantly different distribution between STW and SAW highlighting the need to further investigate the taxonomy and ecology of this group. This study represents a significant step forward towards characterizing protistan communities composition in relation to major water masses and fronts in the South Pacific providing new insights about the biogeography and ecological preferences of different taxa from class to species and genotypic level.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWater-mass preference of different taxa emerged at class, species and genotypic level.\nC_LIO_LIMamiellophyceae green algae dominated in subtropical waters.\nC_LIO_LIDinophyceae and Chloropicophyceae green algae dominated in subantarctic waters.\nC_LIO_LIA diverse assemblage of Radiolaria dominated the mesopelagic zone.\nC_LIO_LISmall rather than large taxa dominated phytoplankton blooms in subtropical waters.\nC_LI",

We show that ketosis, either endogenously produced during fasting or a ketogenic diet, or exogenously administered, promotes a deep quiescent state in muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Although deep quiescent MuSCs are less poised to activate, slowing muscle regeneration, they have markedly improved survival when facing sources of cellular stress. Further, we show that ketone bodies, specifically {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, directly promote MuSC deep quiescence via a non-metabolic mechanism. We show that {beta}-hydroxybutyrate functions as an HDAC inhibitor within MuSCs leading to acetylation and activation of an HDAC1 target protein p53. Finally, we demonstrate that p53 activation contributes to the deep quiescence and enhanced resilience observed during fasting.",

Genome comparisons among Rosaceae species show that Shanmei and Fupenzi (Rubus chingii Hu) are most closely related, and then is blackberry (Rubus occidentalis). Further resequencing of 101 samples of Shanmei collected from four regions in provinces of Yunnan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan in South China reveals that the Hunan population of Shanmei possesses the highest diversity and may represent the relatively more ancestral population. Moreover, the Yunnan population undergoes strong selection based on nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and the historical effective population size analyses. Furthermore, genes from candidate genomic regions that show strong divergence are significantly enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, indicating the genetic basis of adaptation of Shanmei to the local environments. The high-quality genome sequences and the variome dataset of Shanmei provide valuable resources for breeding applications and for elucidating the genome evolution and ecological adaptation of Rubus species.",

Despite the availability of crystal structures of MTHFD2 in the inhibitor- and cofactor-bound forms, key information is missing due to technical limitations, including (a) the location of absolutely required Mg2+ ion, and (b) the substrate-bound form of MTHFD2. Using homology modeling and simulation studies, we propose that two magnesium ions are present at the active site whereby (i) Arg233, Asp225, and two water molecules coordinate MgA, while MgA together with Arg233 stabilize the inorganic phosphate (Pi); (ii) Asp168 and three water molecules coordinate MgB, and MgB further stabilizes Pi by forming a hydrogen bond with two oxygens of Pi; (iii) Arg201 directly coordinates the Pi; and (iv) through three water-mediated interactions, Asp168 contributes to the positioning and stabilization of MgA, MgB and Pi. Our computational study at the empirical valence bond level allowed us to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanisms. We found that the dehydrogenase activity features a proton-coupled electron transfer with charge redistribution coupled to the reorganization of the surrounding water molecules which further facilitates the subsequent cyclohydrolase activity. The cyclohydrolase activity then drives the hydration of the imidazoline ring and the ring opening in a concerted way. Furthermore, we have uncovered that two key residues Ser197/Arg233 are key factors in determining the cofactor (NADP+/NAD+) preference of the dehydrogenase activity. Our work sheds new light on the structural and kinetic framework of MTHFD2, which will be helpful to design small molecule inhibitors that can be used for cancer therapy.",

Bacillus subtilis cultures experiencing nutrient limitation contain distinct sub-populations of cells exhibiting either comparatively high or low protein synthesis activity. This heterogeneity requires the production of phosphorylated guanosine nucleotides (pp)ppGpp by three synthases: SasA, SasB, and RelA. Here we show that these enzymes differentially affect this bimodality: RelA and SasB are necessary to generate the sub-population of cells exhibiting low protein synthesis whereas SasA is necessary to generate cells exhibiting comparatively higher protein synthesis. The RelA product (pppGpp) allosterically activates SasB and we find, in contrast, that the SasA product (pGpp) competitively inhibits this activation. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that this antagonistic interaction mediates the observed heterogeneity in protein synthesis. This work therefore identifies the mechanism underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in the central physiological process of protein synthesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryUpon encountering conditions that are unfavorable to growth, such as nutrient limitation, bacteria enter into a quiescent phenotype that is mediated by group of guanosine nucleotides collectively known as (pp)pGpp. These nucleotides direct the down-regulation of energy intensive processes and are essential for a striking heterogeneity in protein synthesis observed during exit from rapid growth. Here, we show that a network of (pp)pGpp synthases is responsible for this heterogeneity and describe a mechanism that allows for the integration of multiple signals into the decision to down regulate the most energy intensive process in a cell.",

To this end, the T3SS assembles a translocon/pore complex composed of the translocator proteins YopB and YopD in host cell membranes serving as an entry port for the effectors. The translocon is formed in a Yersinia-containing pre-phagosomal compartment that is connected to the extracellular space. As the phagosome matures, the translocon and the membrane damage it causes are recognized by the cell-autonomous immune system. We infected cells in the presence of fluorophore-labeled ALFA-tag-binding nanobodies with a Y. enterocolitica strain expressing YopD labeled with an ALFA-tag. Thereby we could record the integration of YopD into translocons and its intracellular fate in living host cells. YopD was integrated into translocons around 2 min after uptake of the bacteria into a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate enriched pre-phagosomal compartment and remained there for 27 min on average. Damaging of the phagosomal membrane as visualized with recruitment of GFP-tagged galectin-3 occurred in the mean around 14 min after translocon formation. Shortly after recruitment of galectin-3, guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP-1) was recruited to phagosomes, which was accompanied by a decrease in the signal intensity of translocons, suggesting their degradation. In sum, we were able for the first time to film the spatiotemporal dynamics of Yersinia T3SS translocon formation and degradation and its sensing by components of the cell-autonomous immune system.",

Although complex cognition is widely assumed to rely on frontal and parietal brain regions, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive: current approaches are unable to disentangle different forms of information processing in the brain. Here, we introduce a powerful framework to identify synergistic and redundant contributions to neural information processing and cognition. Leveraging multimodal data including functional MRI, PET, cytoarchitectonics and genetics, we reveal that synergistic interactions are the fundamental drivers of complex human cognition. Whereas redundant information dominates sensorimotor areas, synergistic activity is closely associated with the brains prefrontal-parietal and default networks; furthermore, meta-analytic results demonstrate a close relationship between high-level cognitive tasks and synergistic information. From an evolutionary perspective, the human brain exhibits higher prevalence of synergistic information than non-human primates. At the macroscale, we demonstrate that high-synergy regions underwent the highest degree of evolutionary cortical expansion. At the microscale, human-accelerated genes promote synergistic interactions by enhancing synaptic transmission. These convergent results provide critical insights that synergistic neural interactions underlie the evolution and functioning of humans sophisticated cognitive abilities, and demonstrate the power of our widely applicable information decomposition framework.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The first lineage choice made in human embryo development separates trophectoderm from the inner cell mass, which proceeds to form the pluripotent epiblast and primitive endoderm. Trophectoderm on the other hand gives rise to the placenta. Naive pluripotent stem cells are derived from the pluripotent epiblast of the blastocyst and offer possibilities to explore how lineage integrity is maintained. Here, we discover that Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) restricts an intrinsic capacity of naive pluripotent stem cells to give rise to trophectoderm. Through quantitative epigenome profiling, we find that broad histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) hypermethylation is a common feature of naive pluripotency across species. We define a previously unappreciated, naive-specific set of bivalent promoters, featuring PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 concomitant with H3K4me3. Naive bivalency maintains key trophectoderm transcription factors in a transcriptionally poised state that is resolved to an active state upon depletion of H3K27me3 via inhibition of the enzymatic subunits of PRC2, EZH1/2. Conversely, primed human embryonic stem cells cannot be driven towards trophectoderm development via PRC2 inhibition. While naive and primed hESCs share the majority of bivalent promoters, PRC2 contributes to the repression of largely non-overlapping subsets of these promoters in each state, hence H3K27me3-mediated repression provides a highly adaptive mechanism to restrict lineage potential during early human development.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging and in particular in the case of underpowered studies has introduced doubts on our ability to reproduce, replicate and generalize findings. As a response, we have seen the emergence of suggested guidelines and principles for neuroscientists known as Good Scientific Practice for conducting more reliable research. Still, every study remains almost unique in its combination of analytical and statistical approaches. While it is understandable considering the diversity of designs and brain data recording, it also represents a striking point against reproducibility. Here, we propose a non-parametric permutation-based statistical framework, primarily designed for neurophysiological data, in order to perform group-level inferences on non-negative measures of information encompassing metrics from information-theory, machine-learning or measures of distances. The framework supports both fixed- and random-effect models to adapt to inter-individuals and inter-sessions variability. Using numerical simulations, we compared the accuracy in ground-truth retrieving of both group models, such as test- and cluster-wise corrections for multiple comparisons. We then reproduced and extended existing results using both spatially uniform MEG and non-uniform intracranial neurophysiological data. We showed how the framework can be used to extract stereotypical task- and behavior-related effects across the population covering scales from the local level of brain regions, inter-areal functional connectivity to measures summarizing network properties. We also present an open-source Python toolbox called Frites1 that includes the proposed statistical pipeline using information-theoretic metrics such as single-trial functional connectivity estimations for the extraction of cognitive brain networks. Taken together, we believe that this framework deserves careful attention as its robustness and flexibility could be the starting point toward the uniformization of statistical approaches.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nHighlightsO_LIGroup-level statistics for extracting neurophysiological cognitive brain networks\nC_LIO_LICombining non-parametric permutations with measures of information\nC_LIO_LIFixed- and random-effect models, test- and cluster-wise corrections\nC_LIO_LIMulti-level inferences, from local regions to inter-areal functional connectivity\nC_LIO_LIA Python open-source toolbox called Frites includes the proposed statistical methods\nC_LI",

Deformable mirror (DM) is currently the most widely used phase modulator for fluorescence detection as it shows negligible photon loss. However, it relies on careful calibration for precise wavefront control. Therefore, design of an optimal PSF not only relies on the theoretical calculation of maximum information content, but also the physical behavior of the phase modulator, which is often ignored during the optimization process. Here, we developed a framework of PSF engineering which could generate a device specific optimal PSF for 3D super-resolution imaging using DM. We used our method to generate two types of PSFs with depths of field comparable to the widely used astigmatism and Tetrapod PSFs, respectively. We demonstrated the superior performance of the DM specific optimal PSF over the conventional astigmatism and Tetrapod PSF both theoretically and experimentally.",

The invasion of exotic earthworms is known to dramatically alter soil physical, geochemical, and biological properties, but its impacts on soil microbiomes are still unclear. Here we show that the invasive earthworms alter soil microbiomes and ecosystem functioning, especially for nitrogen cycling. We collected soil samples at different depths from three sites across an active earthworm invasion chronosequence in a hardwood forest in Minnesota, USA. We analyzed the structures and the functional potentials of the soil microbiomes by using amplicon sequencing, high-throughput nitrogen cycle gene quantification (NiCE chip), and shotgun metagenomics. Both the levels of earthworm invasion and soil depth influenced the microbiome structures. In the most recently and minimally invaded soils, Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira as well as the genes related to nitrification were more abundant than in the heavily invaded soils. By contrast, genes related to denitrification and nitrogen fixation were more abundant in the heavily invaded than the minimally invaded soils. Our results suggest that the N cycling in forest soils is mostly nitrification driven before earthworm invasion, whereas it becomes denitrification driven after earthworm invasion.",

The recent identification and characterization of a small population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) resident in the brain presents one such potential therapeutic target. Here we identified brain IL2 levels as a limiting factor for brain-resident Tregs. We developed a gene-delivery approach for astrocytes, with a small-molecule on-switch to allow temporal control, and enhanced production in reactive astrocytes to spatially-direct delivery to inflammatory sites. Mice with brain-specific IL2 delivery were protected from traumatic brain injury, stroke and multiple sclerosis models, without impacting the peripheral immune system. These results validate brain-specific IL2 gene-delivery as effective protection against neuroinflammation, and provide a versatile platform for delivery of diverse biologics to neuroinflammatory patients.",

TCR sequencing revealed a diverse repertoire with public TCRs. CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity was driven by the remarkably strong conservation of T cell contact residues in both HLA-DQ5 and HLA-DP4 binding frames, with distinct patterns of HCoV cross-reactivity explained by MHC-II binding preferences and substitutions at secondary TCR contact sites.

Using HLA-C allotypes that differ only by the C1/C2-defining residues, we found that KRAS-G12D neoantigen specific T cell receptors (TCR) discriminated groups C1 and C2 HLA-C, due to effects on peptide presentation and TCR affinity. Structural and functional experiments combined with immunopeptidomics analysis revealed that C1-HLA-C favors smaller amino acids at the peptide C-terminus minus-1 position (p{Omega}-1), and that larger p{Omega}-1 residues diminished TCR recognition of C1-HLA-C. After controlling for peptide presentation, TCRs exhibited weaker affinities for C2-HLA-C despite conserved TCR contacts. Thus, the C1/C2 dimorphism impacts peptide presentation and HLA-C restricted T cell responses, with implications in multiple disease contexts including adoptive T cell therapy targeting KRAS-G12D-induced cancers.",

While most CI users can understand speech in a quiet environment, hearing that utilizes complex neural coding (e.g., appreciating music) has proved elusive, probably because of the inability of CIs to create narrow regions of spectral activation. Several novel approaches have recently shown promise for improving spatial selectivity, but substantial design differences from conventional CIs will necessitate much additional safety testing before clinical viability is established. Outside the cochlea, magnetic stimulation from small coils (micro-coils) has been shown to confine activation more narrowly than that from conventional micro-electrodes, raising the possibility that coil-based stimulation of the cochlea could improve the spectral resolution of CIs. To explore this, we delivered magnetic stimulation from micro-coils to multiple locations of the cochlea and measured the spread of activation utilizing a multi-electrode array inserted into the inferior colliculus; responses to magnetic stimulation were compared to analogous experiments with conventional micro-electrodes as well as to the responses to auditory monotones. Encouragingly, the extent of activation with micro-coils was [~]60% narrower than that from electric stimulation and largely similar to the spread arising from acoustic stimulation. The dynamic range of coils was more than three times larger than that of electrodes, further supporting a smaller spread of activation. While much additional testing is required, these results support the notion that coil-based CIs can produce a larger number of independent spectral channels and may therefore improve functional performance. Further, because coil-based devices are structurally similar to existing CIs, fewer impediments to clinical translational are likely to arise.",

Yet it is still unclear what determines whether VWM is represented as continuous or categorical information, or as a mix of both. Recent studies have shown that color VWM representations adjust flexibly depending on the number of memory items as well as the duration that these items need to be maintained for. The current study aims to extend and replicate these crucial effects. In a delayed estimation task, participants memorized one to four colored objects presented at different spatial locations, followed by a delay of 100, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 ms. Next, a probe indicated the location of the color that participants needed to report. We measured the extent to which responses were biased in the direction of prototypical colors. Crucially, we implemented this categorical bias in an extension to the classic mixture model (Zhang & Luck 2008) in which the center of the error distribution is a crucial parameter that characterizes the extent to which VWM is biased by color categories. We found that VWM shows a strong categorical bias in all cases, and that this bias increases with increasing memory load; strikingly, this effect of memory load on categorical bias is stronger at longer intervals (1,000 ms or longer), as compared to shorter intervals, yet it peaks for intermediate memory loads as opposed to the highest memory load. Overall, our results suggest that when visual information needs to be maintained for one second or longer, VWM becomes more reliant on categorical representations as memory load increases.",

However, the vascular phloem continuum through aerial organs remains understudied.\n\nWe analyzed the structure of phloem conduits across leaf veins and stems of A. scandens, combining topological data obtained through light and electron microscopy, with current models of phloem transport.\n\nLeaves displayed a low xylem to phloem ratio compared with leaves of other angiosperms, with vascular elements invariant in diameter along the midrib, but tapered across vein hierarchies. Sieve plate pore radii were extremely small: 0.08 {micro}m in minor veins, increasing to 0.12{micro}m in the petiole and only to 0.20{micro}m at the base of the stem, tens of meters away. Searcher branches contained tube shaped phloem conduits with a pectin-rich wall, whereas twining stems displayed sieve elements with tangential connections that displayed a greater fraction of the tubes populated with an astonishing number of sieve plates.\n\nHydraulic segmentation of the leaves in Austrobaileyaceae correlate with vesseless leaves that benefit photoassimilate export through volumetric scaling of the sieve tube elements. Yet, compared with canopy dominant trees, the geometrical properties of the sieve tube in twining stems, restrict considerably energy distribution in the sub-canopy layers, potentially favoring the allocation of assimilates toward the elongating branches. Thus, the conductive xylem of twining stems contrasts with a poorly conductive phloem that meets the mechanical constraints of lianescence.",

However, it is not currently understood how active physical remodeling of the network by cells affects their migration dynamics. Here, we study collective migration of small clusters of cells on deformable collagen-1 networks. Combining theory and experiments, we find that cell clusters, despite displaying no apparent internal polarity, migrate persistently and generate asymmetric collagen gradients during migration. We find that persistent migration can arise from viscoelastic relaxation of collagen networks, and reducing the viscoelastic relaxation time by chemical crosslinking leads to a reduction in migration persistence. Single cells produce only short range network deformations that relax on shorter timescales, which leads to lower migration persistence. This physical model provides a mechanism for self-generated directional migration on viscoelastic substrates in the absence of internal biochemical cues.",

It is still not known what the biochemical changes are inside a cell which will eventually lead to A{beta}42 aggregation. Thermogenesis has been associated with cellular stress, the latter of which may promote aggregation. We perform intracellular thermometry measurements using fluorescent polymeric thermometers (FPTs) to show that A{beta}42 aggregation in live cells leads to an increase in cell-averaged temperatures. This rise in temperature is mitigated upon treatment with an aggregation inhibitor of A{beta}42 and is independent of mitochondrial damage that can otherwise lead to thermogenesis. With this, we present a diagnostic assay which could be used to screen small-molecule inhibitors to amyloid proteins in physiologically relevant settings. To interpret our experimental observations and motivate the development of future models, we perform classical molecular dynamics of model A{beta} peptides to examine the factors that hinder thermal disspation. We observe that this is controlled by the presence of ions in its surrounding environment, the morphology of the amyloid peptides and the extent of its hydrogen-bonding interactions with water. We show that aggregation and heat retention by A{beta} peptides are favoured under intracellular-mimicking ionic conditions, which could potentially promote thermogenesis.

    "preprint_abstract": "Tool understanding and use are supported by a dedicated left-lateralized, intrinsically connected network in the human adult brain. To examine this networks phylogenic and ontogenetic origins, we compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) among regions subserving tool processing in human adults to rsFC among homologous regions in human neonates and macaque monkeys (adolescent and mature). These homologous regions formed an intrinsic network in human neonates, but not in macaques. Network topological patterns were highly similar between human adults and neonates, and significantly less so between humans and macaques. The premotor-parietal rsFC had most significant contribution to the formation of the neonate tool network. These results suggest that an intrinsic brain network potentially supporting tool processing exists in the human brain prior to individual tool use experiences, and that the premotor-parietal functional connection in particular offers a brain basis for complex tool behaviors specific to humans.",

Rabbit monoclonal antibodies (RmAbs) are distinguished owing to their high affinity and stability. However, the efficiency and availability of traditional methods for RmAb discovery are limited, especially for small molecules. Here, we present an indirect competitive screening method in nanowells, named CSMN, for single rabbit antibody secreting cells (ASCs) selection with 20.6 h and proposed an efficient platform for RmAb production against small molecule with 5.8 days for the first time. Chloramphenicol (CAP) as an antibacterial agent has the great threats for public health. We applied the CSMN to select CAP-specific ASCs and produced one high affinity RmAb, surprisingly showing extremely halophilic properties with an IC50 of 0.08 ng mL-1 in saturated salt solution which has as yet not been shown by other antibodies. Molecular dynamic simulation showed that the negatively charged surface improved the stability of the RmAb structure with additional disulfide bonds compared with mouse antibody. Moreover, the reduced solvent accessible surface area of the binding pocket increased the interactions of RmAb with CAP in a saturated salt solution. Furthermore, the RmAb was used to develop an immunoassay for the detection of CAP in real biological samples with simple pretreatment, shorter assay time, and higher sensitivity. The results demonstrated that the practical and efficient CSMN is suitable for rare RmAb discovery against small molecules.",

The expression of the Fc{gamma} receptor CD32 has been identified as a marker of the active cell reservoirs in people on antiretroviral therapy, but if its expression has any role in conferring advantage for viral persistence is unknown. Here, we report that HIV-infected cells expressing CD32 have reduced susceptibility to natural killer (NK) antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) by a mechanism compatible with the suboptimal binding of HIV-specific antibodies. Infected CD32 cells have increased proliferative capacity in the presence of immune complexes, and are more resistant to strategies directed to potentiate NK function. Remarkably, reactivation of the latent reservoir from antiretroviral-treated people living with HIV increases the pool of infected CD32 cells, which are largely resistant to the ADCC immune mechanism. Thus, we report the existence of reservoir cells that evade part of the NK immune response through the expression of CD32.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

One such example, Macaca arctoides, the bear macaque, has compensatory changes in both male and female genital morphology as compared to close relatives. Macaca arctoides also has a complex evolutionary history, having extensive introgression between the fascicularis and sinica macaque species groups. Here, phylogenetic relationships were analyzed via whole genome sequences from five species, including M. arctoides, and two species each from the putative parental species groups. This analysis revealed [~]3x more genomic regions supported placement in the sinica species group as compared to the fascicularis species group. Additionally, introgression analysis of the M. arctoides genome revealed it is a mosaic of recent polymorphisms shared with both species groups. To examine the evolution of their unique genital morphology further, the prevalence of candidate genes involved in genital morphology were compared against genome-wide outliers in various population genetic metrics, while accounting for background variation in recombination rate. This analysis identified 66 outlier genes, including several genes that influence baculum morphology in mice, which were of interest since the bear macaque has the longest primate baculum. The mean of several metrics was statistically different in the candidate genes as compared to the rest of the genome, suggesting that genes involved in genital morphology have increased divergence and decreased diversity beyond expectations. These results highlight how extensive introgression may have contributed to reproductive isolation and shaped the unique genital morphology in the bear macaque.",

To understand how signals evolve, we thus need to consider selection responses in multiple components and account for the genetic correlations among components. One intriguing possibility is that selection changes the genetic covariance structure of a multicomponent signal in a way that facilitates a response to selection. However, this hypothesis remains largely untested empirically. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary response of the multicomponent female sex pheromone blend of the moth Heliothis subflexa to 10 generations of artificial selection. We observed a selection response of about 3/4s of a phenotypic standard deviation in the components under selection. Interestingly, other pheromone components that are biochemically and genetically linked to the components under selection did not change. We also found that after the onset of selection, the genetic covariance structure diverged, resulting in the disassociation of components under selection and components not under selection across the first two genetic principle components. Our findings provide rare empirical support for an intriguing mechanism by which a sexual signal can respond to selection without possible constraints from indirect selection responses.",

Upon infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain (pH1N1), many humans produced antibodies against epitopes in the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk. HA stalk-focused antibody responses were common among pH1N1-infected individuals because HA stalk epitopes were conserved between the pH1N1 strain and previously circulating H1N1 strains. Here, we completed a series of experiments to determine if the pH1N1 HA stalk has acquired substitutions since 2009 that prevent the binding of human antibodies. We identified several amino acid substitutions that have accrued in the pH1N1 HA stalk from 2009-2019. We completed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, absorption-based binding assays, and surface plasmon resonance experiments to determine if these substitutions affect antibody binding. Using sera collected from 230 humans (aged 21-80 years), we found that pH1N1 HA stalk substitutions that have emerged since 2009 do not affect antibody binding. Our data suggest that the HA stalk domain of pH1N1 viruses remained antigenically stable after circulating in humans for a decade.\n\nImportanceIn 2009, a new pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus began circulating in humans. Many individuals mounted hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-focused antibody responses upon infection with the 2009 pH1N1, since the HA stalk of this virus was relatively conserved with other seasonal H1N1 strains. Here, we completed a series of studies to determine if the 2009 pH1N1 strain has undergone antigenic drift in the HA stalk domain over the past decade. We found that serum antibodies from 230 humans could not antigenically distinguish the 2009 and 2019 HA stalk. These data suggest that the HA stalk of pH1N1 has remained antigenically stable, despite the presence of high levels of HA stalk antibodies within the human population.",

Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), the mildest form of CAPS, is characterized by cold-induced inflammation induced by the overproduction of IL-1{beta}. However, the molecular mechanism of how mutated NLRP3 causes inflammasome activation in CAPS remains unclear. Here, we found that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates that function as a scaffold for inflammasome activation. Cold exposure promoted inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1{beta} release triggered by mutated NLRP3. While K+ efflux was dispensable, Ca2+ was indispensable for mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Notably, Ca2+ influx was induced during mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Furthermore, caspase-1 inhibition prevented Ca2+ influx and inflammasome assembly induced by the mutated NLRP3, suggesting a feed-forward Ca2+ influx loop triggered by mutated NLRP3. Thus, the mutated NLRP3 forms cryo-sensitive aggregates to promote inflammasome assembly distinct from canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

Non-invasive monitoring of A{beta} deposits enables assessing the disease burden in patients and animal models mimicking aspects of the human disease as well as evaluating the efficacy of A{beta}-modulating therapies. Previous in vivo assessments of plaque load in mouse models of cerebral amyloidosis have been predominantly based on two-dimensional diffuse fluorescence reflectance imaging (2D-FRI) and two-photon microscopy (2PM) using A{beta}-specific imaging agents. However, 2D-FRI lacks depth resolution, whereas 2PM is restricted by the limited field of view preventing coverage of large brain regions. Here, we utilized a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) pipeline with the curcumin derivative fluorescent probe CRANAD-2 to achieve full 3D brain coverage for detecting A{beta} accumulation in the arcA{beta} mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. A homebuilt FMT system was used for data acquisition in combination with a customized software platform enabling the integration of anatomical information derived from MRI as prior information for FMT image reconstruction. The results obtained from the FMT-MRI study were compared to data obtained from conventional 2D-FRI recorded under similar physiological conditions. The two methods yielded comparable time courses of the fluorescence intensity following intravenous injection of CRANAD-2 in a region of interest comprising the mouse brain. The depth resolution inherent to FMT allowed separation of signal contributions from the scalp and different brain regions, indicating preferential accumulation of the fluorescent tracer in the cerebral cortex, a region characterized by significant plaque deposition in arc A{beta} mice. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of visualizing A{beta} deposition in 3D using a multimodal FMT-MRI method. This hybrid imaging method provides complementary anatomical, physiological and molecular information, thereby enabling the detailed characterization of the disease status in mouse models of cerebral amyloidosis, which is also important for monitoring the efficacy of putative treatments targeting A{beta}.",

Because of the complex mechanisms underlying protein formation, the creation of a novel protein requires tedious and time-consuming computational or experimental protocols. At the same time, machine learning has enabled the solving of complex problems by leveraging large amounts of available data, more recently with great improvements on the domain of generative modeling. Yet, generative models have mainly been applied to specific sub-problems of protein design.\n\nResultsHere we approach the problem of general purpose protein design conditioned on functional labels of the hierarchical Gene Ontology. Since a canonical way to evaluate generative models in this domain is missing, we devise an evaluation scheme of several biologically and statistically inspired metrics. We then develop the conditional generative adversarial network ProteoGAN and show that it outperforms several classic and more recent deep learning baselines for protein sequence generation. We further give insights into the model by analysing hyperparameters and ablation baselines. Lastly, we hypothesize that a functionally conditional model could generate proteins with novel functions by combining labels and provide first steps into this direction of research.\n\nAvailabilityCode and data is available at https://github.com/timkucera/proteogan\n\nContacttim.kucera@bsse.ethz.ch, mt@visium.ch, lpapaxanthos@google.com",

Yet, little is known about the mechanisms and molecular intermediates involved. Here, we report that aged aryl hydrocarbon receptor-null mice (AhR-/-) had exacerbated senescence and larger numbers of liver progenitor cells. Senescence-associated markers {beta}-galactosidase (SA-{beta}-Gal), p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 and genes of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) TNF and IL1 were overexpressed in aged AhR-/- livers. AhR binding to the promoter of those genes, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation, likely had a repressive effect maintaining their physiological levels in AhR+/+ livers. Furthermore, factors secreted by senescent cells MCP-2, MMP12 and FGF were also produced at higher levels in aged AhR-null livers. Supporting the linkage between senescence and stemness, liver progenitor cells were more abundant in AhR-/- mice, which could probably contribute to their increased hepatocarcinoma burden. These roles of AhR are not liver-specific since adult and embryonic AhR-null fibroblasts acquired cellular senescence upon culturing with overexpression of SA-{beta}-Gal, p16Ink4a and p21Cip1. Notably, depletion of senescent cells with the senolytic agent navitoclax restored basal expression of senescent markers in AhR-/- fibroblasts. Oppositely, senescence promoter palbociclib induced an AhR-null like phenotype in AhR+/+ fibroblasts. Moreover, doxycycline-induced senescence reduced AhR levels while depletion of p16Ink4a-expressing senescent cells restored basal AhR levels in mouse lungs. Thus, AhR is needed to restrict age-induced senescence, and such activity seems to correlate with a more differentiated phenotype and with increased resistance to liver tumorigenesis.",

However, boundaries can also occur at transitions between internal mental states, without relevant external input changes. To what extent do such \"internal boundaries\" share neural response properties with externally-driven boundaries? We conducted an fMRI experiment where subjects watched a series of short movies and then verbally recalled the movies, unprompted, in the order of their choosing. During recall, transitions between movies thus constituted major boundaries between internal mental contexts, generated purely by subjects unguided thoughts. Following the offset of each recalled movie, we observed stereotyped spatial activation patterns in the default mode network, especially the posterior medial cortex, consistent across different movie contents and even across the different tasks of movie watching and recall. Surprisingly, the between-movie boundary patterns did not resemble patterns at boundaries between events within a movie. Thus, major transitions between mental contexts elicit neural phenomena shared across internal and external modes and distinct from within-context event boundary detection, potentially reflecting a cognitive state related to the flushing and reconfiguration of situation models.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Understanding cell behaviors can provide new knowledge on the development of different pathologies. Focal adhesion (FA) sites are important sub-cellular structures that are involved in these processes. To better facilitate the study of FA sites, deep learning (DL) can be used to predict FA site morphology based on limited datasets (e.g., cell membrane images). However, calculating the accuracy score of these predictions can be challenging due to the discrete/point pattern like nature of FA sites. In the present work, a new image similarity metric, discrete protein metric (DPM), was developed to calculate FA prediction accuracy. This metric measures differences in distribution (d), shape/size (s), and angle (a) of FA sites between the predicted image and its ground truth image. Performance of the DPM was evaluated by comparing it to three other commonly used image similarity metrics: Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), feature similarity index (FSIM), and Intersection over Union (IoU). A sensitivity analysis was performed by comparing changes in each metric value due to quantifiable changes in FA site location, number, aspect ratio, area, or orientation. Furthermore, accuracy score of DL-generated predictions was calculated using all four metrics to compare their ability to capture variation across samples. Results showed better sensitivity and range of variation for DPM compared to the other metrics tested. Most importantly, DPM had the ability to determine which FA predictions were quantitatively more accurate and consistent with qualitative assessments. The proposed DPM hence provides a method to validate DL-generated FA predictions and can be extended to evaluating other predicted or segmented discrete structures of biomedical relevance.",

The uremic MDMs (uMDMs) phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), p-cresol sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS) accumulate during renal failure and are associated with poor outcomes. Targeted dietary interventions may reduce toxic MDMs generation; however, it is unclear if interindividual differences in diet or gut microbiome dominantly contribute to MDM variance. Here we use a 7-day homogeneous average American diet to standardize dietary precursor availability in 21 healthy individuals. Notably, the coefficient of variation in three uMDMs of interest, PAG, PCS, and IS (primary outcome), did not significantly decrease. The majority of circulating MDMs maintained variation despite identical diets. These results highlight the highly personalized profile of MDMs and limited contribution of short-term dietary heterogeneity, suggesting that dietary modification may need to be paired with microbial therapies to control MDM profiles.",

    "preprint_abstract": "As of January 2022, at least 60 million individuals are estimated to develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been observed in non-specific PASC, little is known about their impact on pulmonary function which is compromised in the majority of these individuals. This study compares frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and inflammatory markers with lung function in participants with pulmonary PASC and resolved COVID-19 (RC). Compared to RC, participants with respiratory PASC had up to 34-fold higher frequencies of IFN-{gamma}- and TNF--producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood and elevated levels of plasma CRP and IL-6. Importantly, in PASC participants the frequency of TNF--producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which exhibited the highest levels of Ki67 indicating they were activity dividing, correlated positively with plasma IL-6 and negatively with measures of lung function, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), while increased frequencies of IFN-{gamma}-producing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with prolonged dyspnea. Statistical analyses stratified by age, number of comorbidities and hospitalization status demonstrated that none of these factors affect differences in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 T cells and plasma IL-6 levels measured between PASC and RC cohorts. Taken together, these findings demonstrate elevated frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in individuals with pulmonary PASC are associated with increased systemic inflammation and decreased lung function, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells contribute to lingering pulmonary symptoms. These findings also provide mechanistic insight on the pathophysiology of PASC that can inform development of potential treatments to reduce symptom burden.\n\nAuthor SummaryLong COVID-19 or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) impacts 20-30% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 and is characterized by COVID-19 symptoms exceeding 4 weeks from symptom onset. While those with PASC experience a wide variety of persistent symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, brain fog, fatigue, and intermittent fever, lung-related conditions are the most common. Although, infection with SARS-CoV-2 is clearly the inciting factor for PASC, the mechanisms responsible for long-term lung dysfunction are unclear and current treatments are ineffective at resolving pulmonary symptoms. Generalized PASC has been associated with SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, a component of adaptive immunity, suggesting that residual virus may persist. Here, we investigated the frequency and function of virus-specific T cells in the blood of individuals with pulmonary PASC and correlated their presence with systemic inflammation and lung function. Our findings demonstrated that T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 are elevated in the blood of those with pulmonary PASC and are associated with increased IL-6, a cytokine strongly associated with COVID-19 severity, and decreased lung function. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of pulmonary PASC needed for the development of new treatments to improve quality of life for those affected.",

Recently, it has been found that both conformations coexist in a dynamical equilibrium and that several biological functions require HG pairs. This relevance has motivated experimental and computational investigations of the base-pairing transition. However, a systematic simulation of sequence variations has remained out of reach. Here, we employ advanced path-based methods to perform unprecedented free-energy calculations. Our methodology enables us to study the different mechanisms of purine rotation, either remaining inside or after flipping outside of the double helix. We study seven different sequences, which are neighbor variations of a well-studied A{middle dot}T pair in A6-DNA. We observe the known effect of A{middle dot}T steps favoring HG stability, and find evidence of triple-hydrogen-bonded neighbors hindering the inside transition. More importantly, we identify a dominant factor: the direction of the A rotation, with the 6-ring pointing either towards the longer or shorter segment of the chain, respectively relating to a lower or higher barrier. This highlights the role of DNAs relative flexibility as a modulator of the WCF/HG dynamic equilibrium. Additionally, we provide a robust methodology for future HG proclivity studies.",

These studies shed light on brain-wide signals but lacked explanatory power at the single neuron level. Similarly, single neuron studies can suffer from inability to measure brain-wide signals. Here, we combined these techniques while monkeys performed a change detection task and discovered a link between EEG and a signal embedded in spiking responses. This  slow drift was associated with arousal: decreases in pre-stimulus  power/increases in P1 amplitude were accompanied by :1) increases in pupil size, false alarm rate and saccade velocity; and 2) decreases in microsaccade rate and reaction time. These results show that brain-wide EEG signals can be used to index modes of activity acquired from direct neural recordings, that in turn reflect global changes in brain state that influence perception and behavior.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Inhibitory neurons take on many forms and functions. How this diversity contributes to memory function is not completely known. Previous formal studies indicate inhibition differentiated by local and global connectivity in associative memory networks functions to rescale the level of retrieval of excitatory assemblies. However, such studies lack biological details such as a distinction between types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), unrealistic connection schemas, and non-sparse assemblies. In this study, we present a rate-based cortical model where neurons are distinguished (as excitatory, local inhibitory, or global inhibitory), connected more realistically, and where memory items correspond to sparse excitatory assemblies. We use this model to study how local-global inhibition balance can alter memory retrieval in associative memory structures, including naturalistic and artificial structures. Experimental studies have reported inhibitory neurons and their sub-types uniquely respond to specific stimuli and can form sophisticated, joint excitatory-inhibitory assemblies. Our model suggests such joint assemblies, as well as a distribution and rebalancing of overall inhibition between two inhibitory sub-populations - one connected to excitatory assemblies locally and the other connected globally - can quadruple the range of retrieval across related memories. We identify a possible functional role for local-global inhibitory balance to, in the context of choice or preference of relationships, permit and maintain a broader range of memory items when local inhibition is dominant and conversely consolidate and strengthen a smaller range of memory items when global inhibition is dominant. This model therefore highlights a biologically-plausible and behaviourally-useful function of inhibitory diversity in memory.",

We find that birdwatchers in Indias 20 most populous cities observed 8-17% more species during the lockdown. Most additional observations occurred after a two-week lag, signaling greater abundance instead of improved detection. More frequent appearances of at-risk, rare, and common species were recorded, implying that making our cities more wildlife friendly can protect threatened species in addition to urban specialists. Our contributions are: 1) to isolate and estimate a causal impact of reducing human activity on avian diversity, 2) to improve the external validity of this literature in rapidly urbanizing bio-diverse developing countries, and, 3) to illustrate a method separating abundance from detection in observational avian surveys.",

Here, we investigate how DNA twist -one of the central properties of DNA- changes with concentration and identity of the surrounding ions. To resolve how cations influence the helical twist, we combine single-molecule magnetic tweezer experiments and extensive all- atom molecular dynamics simulations. Two interconnected trends are observed for monovalent alkali and divalent alkaline earth cations. First, DNA twist increases monotonously with increasing concentration for all ions investigated. Second, for a given salt concentration, DNA twist strongly depends on cation identity. At 100 mM concentration, DNA twist increases as Ba2+ < Na+ < K+ < Rb+ < Li+ {approx} Cs+ < Sr2+ < Mg2+ < Ca2+. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal that preferential binding of the cations to the DNA backbone or the nucleobases has opposing effects on DNA twist and provides the microscopic explanation of the observed ion specificity. However, the simulations also reveal shortcomings of existing force field parameters for Cs+ and Sr2+.

LincRNA-p21 is also critical in down-regulating many p53 target genes through its interaction with a p53 repressive complex. The interaction between LincRNA-p21 and the repressive complex is likely dependent on the RNA tertiary structure. Previous studies have determined the two-dimensional secondary structures of the sense and antisense human LincRNA-p21 AluSx1 IRs using SHAPE. However, there were no insights into its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, we in vitro transcribed the sense and antisense regions of LincRNA-p21 AluSx1 Inverted Repeats (IRs) and performed analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, light scattering, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies. Based on these studies, we determined low-resolution, three-dimensional structures of sense and antisense LincRNA-p21. By adapting previously known two-dimensional information, we calculated their sense and antisense high-resolution models and determined that they agree with the low-resolution structures determined using SAXS. Thus, our integrated approach provides insights into the structure of LincRNA-p21 Alu IRs.

It is deposited on the mRNA during splicing and regulates diverse processes including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, mRNA translation, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) via various interacting peripheral proteins. The EJC-binding protein RNPS1 might serve two functions: it suppresses mis-splicing of cryptic splice sites and activates NMD in the cytoplasm. When analyzing the transcriptome-wide effects of EJC and RNPS1 knockdowns in different human cell lines, we find no evidence for RNPS1 being a globally essential NMD factor. However, various aberrant splicing events strongly suggest that the main function of RNPS1 is splicing regulation. Rescue analyses revealed that about half of these RNPS1-dependent splicing events was fully or partially rescued by the expression of the isolated RRM domain of RNPS1, whereas other splicing events are regulated by its C-terminal domain. We identified many splicing-regulatory factors, including SR proteins and U1 snRNP components, that specifically interact with the C-terminus or with the RRM of RNPS1. Thus, RNPS1 emerges as a multifunctional splicing regulator that promotes correct and efficient splicing of different vulnerable splicing events via the formation of diverse splicing-promoting complexes.",

One important factor for modeling binge drinking in mice is that subjects reliably drink to blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) of 80 mg/dl or higher. Drinking-in-the-dark (DID) is a commonly used mouse model of binge drinking, and we have shown these methods reliably result in robust ethanol front-loading and binge-level BECs in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as well as other ethanol-preferring mouse strains/lines. However, establishing the DID model in a new vivarium space forced us to consider the use of rodent diet formulations we had not previously used. The current set of experiments were designed to investigate the role of two standard rodent diet formulations on binge drinking and the development of ethanol front-loading using DID. We found that BECs in animals maintained on LabDiet 5001 (LD01) were double those found in mice maintained on Teklad 2920x (TL20). Interestingly, this effect was paralleled by differences in the degree of front-loading, such that LD01-fed mice consumed approximately twice as much ethanol in the first 15 minutes of the 2-hour DID sessions compared to TL20-fed mice. Surprisingly however, mice that developed front-loading during maintenance on the LD01 diet continued to display front-loading behavior after being switched to the TL20 diet. These data emphasize the importance of choosing and reporting diet formulations when conducting voluntary drinking studies and support the need for further investigation into the mechanisms behind diet-induced differences in binge drinking, particularly front-loading.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In mammalian cells genes that are in close proximity are coupled transcriptionally: silencing or activating one gene can affect its neighbors. Understanding these dynamics is important for natural processes, such as heterochromatin spreading during development and aging, and when designing synthetic gene regulation. Here, we systematically dissect this process in single cells by recruiting and releasing repressive chromatin regulators at dual-gene synthetic reporters, and measuring how fast gene silencing and reactivation spread as a function of intergenic distance and configuration of insulator elements. We find that silencing by KRAB, associated with histone methylation, spreads between two genes within hours, with a time delay that increases with distance. This fast KRAB-mediated spreading is not blocked by the classical cHS4 insulators. Silencing by histone deacetylase HDAC4 of the upstream gene can also lead to downstream gene silencing, but with a days-long delay that does not change with distance. This slower silencing can sometimes be stopped by insulators. Gene reactivation of neighboring genes is also coupled, with strong promoters and insulators determining the order of reactivation. We propose a new model of multi-gene regulation, where both gene silencing and gene reactivation can act at a distance, allowing for coordinated dynamics via chromatin regulator recruitment.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Organisms with complex life cycles demonstrate a remarkable ability to change their phenotypes across development, presumably as an evolutionary adaptation to developmentally variable environments. Developmental variation in environmentally sensitive performance, and thermal sensitivity in particular, has been well documented in holometabolous insects. For example, thermal performance in adults and juvenile stages exhibit little genetic correlation (genetic decoupling) and can evolve independently, resulting in divergent thermal responses. Yet, we understand very little about how this genetic decoupling occurs. We tested the hypothesis that genetic decoupling of thermal physiology is driven by fundamental differences in physiology between life stages, despite a potentially conserved Cellular Stress Response. We used RNAseq to compare transcript expression in response to a cold stressor in Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults and used RNAi (RNA interference) to test whether knocking down nine target genes differentially affected larval and adult cold tolerance. Transcriptomic responses of whole larvae and adults during and following exposure to -5{degrees}C were largely unique both in identity of responding transcripts and in temporal dynamics. Further, we found no relationship between stage-specificity and tissue-specificity of transcripts, suggesting that the differences are not simply driven by differences in tissue composition across development. In addition, RNAi of target genes resulted in largely stage-specific and sometimes sex-specific effects on cold tolerance. The combined evidence suggests that thermal physiology is largely stage-specific at the level of gene expression, and thus natural selection may be acting on different loci during the independent thermal adaptation of different life stages.\n\nSummary StatementRNAseq and gene knockout via transgenic RNAi lines suggest that physiological responses to low temperatures are largely distinct across life stages of the fly Drosophila melanogaster.",

With respect to the facial skeleton, the left side is more commonly and/or severely affected than the right. Such asymmetries complicate treatment options. Mechanisms underlying variation in disease severity between individuals as well as within individuals (asymmetries) are still relatively unknown.\n\nResultsDevelopmental reductions in Fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) have a dosage dependent effect on jaw size, shape, and symmetry. Further, Fgf8 mutants have directionally asymmetric jaws with the left side being more affected than the right. Defects in lower jaw development begin with an early disruption to Meckels cartilage, which is discontinuous and appears as two separate condensations in Fgf8 mutants. All skeletal elements associated with the proximal condensation are dysmorphic in the mutants, which is exemplified by a malformed and mis-oriented malleus. At later stages, Fgf8 mutants exhibit syngnathia, which falls into 2 broad categories: bony fusion of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar ridges and zygomatico-mandibular fusion. All of these morphological defects exhibit both inter- and intra-individual variation.\n\nConclusionsWe hypothesize that these asymmetries are linked to asymmetries in heart development resulting in higher levels of Fgf8 on the right side of the face during development, which may buffer the right side to mild developmental perturbations. This mutant mouse is a good model for future investigations of mechanisms underlying human syngnathia and facial asymmetry.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce alternative phenotypes in response to its environment of development, is an important mechanism for coping with variable environments. While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low - but significant - effect of strain x environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tissue fusion is an oft-employed process in morphogenesis which often requires the removal of the epithelia intervening multiple distinct primordia to form one continuous structure. In the mammalian secondary palate, a midline epithelial seam (MES) forms between two palatal shelves and must be removed to allow mesenchymal confluence. Abundant apoptosis and cell extrusion in this epithelial seam support their importance in its removal. However, by genetically disrupting the intrinsic apoptotic regulators BAX and BAK within the MES, we find a complete loss of cell death and cell extrusion, but successful removal of the MES, indicating that developmental compensation enables fusion. Novel static and live imaging approaches reveal that the MES is removed through a unique form of collective epithelial cell migration in which epithelial trails and islands stream through the mesenchyme to reach the oral and nasal epithelial surfaces. These epithelial trails and islands begin to express periderm markers while retaining expression of the basal epithelial marker {Delta}Np63, suggesting their migration to the oral and nasal surface is concomitant with their differentiation to an epithelial intermediate. Live imaging reveals anisotropic actomyosin contractility within epithelial trails that drives their peristaltic movement, and genetic loss of non-muscle myosin IIA-mediated actomyosin contractility results in dispersion of epithelial collectives and dramatic failure of normal MES migration. These findings demonstrate redundancy between cellular mechanisms of morphogenesis and reveal a crucial role for a unique form of collective epithelial migration during tissue fusion.",

On the contrary to the well characterized function of their SNARE domains bringing the plasma and vesicular membranes together, the level of contribution of their juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) to the vesicle fusion is still under debate. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed three groups of STX1A mutations: 1) elongation of STX1As JMD by three amino acid insertions in the junction of SNARE-JMD or JMD-TMD; 2) charge reversal mutations in STX1As JMD; and 3) palmitoylation deficiency mutations in STX1As TMD. We found that both JMD elongations and charge reversal mutations have position dependent differential effects on Ca2+-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release in cultured murine hippocampal neurons. Importantly, we show that STX1As JMD regulates the palmitoylation of STX1As TMD and loss of STX1A palmitoylation either through charge reversal mutation K260E or by loss of TMD cysteines particularly inhibits spontaneous vesicle fusion. Interestingly, the retinal ribbon specific STX3B has a glutamate in the position corresponding to the K260E mutation in STX1A and mutating it with E259K acts as a molecular on-switch. Furthermore, palmitoylation of post-synaptic STX3A can be induced by the exchange of its JMD with STX1As JMD together with the incorporation of two cysteines into its TMD. Forced palmitoylation of STX3A dramatically enhances spontaneous vesicle fusion suggesting that STX1A regulates spontaneous release through two distinct mechanisms: one through the C-terminal half of its SNARE domain and the other through the palmitoylation of its TMD.",

One strategy to reduce toxic, extracellular aggregation of TTR is to decrease the population of aggregation-prone protein secreted from mammalian cells. Stress-independent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated transcription factor ATF6 preferentially decreases secretion and subsequent aggregation of destabilized, aggregation-prone TTR variants. However, the mechanism of this reduced secretion was previously undefined. Here, we implement a mass spectrometry-based interactomics approach to identify endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis factors involved in ATF6-dependent reductions of destabilized TTR secretion. We show that ATF6 activation reduces amyloidogenic TTR secretion and subsequent aggregation through a mechanism involving ER retention that is mediated by increased interactions with ATF6-regulated ER proteostasis factors including BiP and PDIA4. Intriguingly, the PDIA4-dependent retention of TTR is independent of both the single TTR cysteine residue and the redox activity of PDIA4, indicating that PDIA4 retains destabilized TTR in the ER through a redox-independent chaperoning activity. Our results define a mechanistic basis to explain the ATF6 activation-dependent reduction of destabilized, amyloidogenic TTR secretion that could be therapeutically accessed to improve treatments of TTR-related amyloid diseases.",

Leukemia hierarchy composition was associated with functional, genomic, and clinical properties and converged into four overall classes, spanning Primitive, Mature, GMP, and Intermediate. Critically, variation in hierarchy composition along the Primitive vs GMP or Primitive vs Mature axes were associated with response to chemotherapy or drug sensitivity profiles of targeted therapies, respectively.

Cerebral edema following TBI is known to play a critical role in injury severity and prognosis.

We then directly quantified brain water content in the same subjects ex vivo. We found that both males and females had similarly elevated T2 values after TBI compared with sham controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was more variable than T2 and did not show significant injury effects in males or females. Brain water was elevated in male TBI rats compared with sham controls, but there was no difference between female TBI and sham groups. Notably, MRI biomarkers of edema were more closely correlated with brain water in male rats; female rats did not show any relationship between brain water and T2 or ADC. These observations raise questions about the interpretation of radiological findings traditionally interpreted as edema in female TBI patients. A better understanding of sex differences and similarities in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic edema is needed to help improve patient management and the development of effective treatment strategies for men and women.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The generation of surrogate data, i.e., the modification of original data to destroy a certain feature, is used for the implementation of a null-hypothesis whenever an analytical approach is not feasible. Thus, surrogate data generation has been extensively used to assess the significance of spike correlations in parallel spike trains. In this context, one of the main challenges is to properly construct the desired null-hypothesis distribution and to avoid a bias in the null-hypothesis by altering the spike train statistics.\n\nA classical surrogate technique is uniform dithering (UD), which displaces spikes locally and uniformly. In this study, we compare UD against five surrogate techniques (two newly introduced) in the context of the detection of significant spatio-temporal spike patterns. We evaluate the surrogates for their performance, first on spike trains based on point process models with constant firing rate, and second on modeled non-stationary artificial data serving as ground truth to assess the pattern detection in a more complex and realistic setting. We determine which statistical features of the original spike trains are modified and to which extent. Moreover, we find that UD fails as an appropriate surrogate because it leads to a loss of spikes in the context of binning and clipping, and thus to a large number of false-positive patterns. The other surrogates achieve a better performance in detecting precisely timed higher-order correlations. Based on these insights, we analyze experimental data from pre-/motor cortex of macaque monkeys during a reaching-and-grasping task for spatio-temporal spike patterns.\n\nSignificance statementTemporal jittering or dithering of single spikes or subsections of spike trains is a common method of generating surrogate data for the statistical analysis of temporal spike correlations. We discovered a serious problem with the classical and widely used method of uniform dithering that can lead to an overestimation of significance, i.e., to false positives in the statistical evaluation of spatio-temporal spike patterns. Therefore we consider 5 other dithering methods, compare and evaluate their statistical properties. Finally, we apply a much better method (trial shifting) to the analysis of experimental multiple-unit recordings and find several highly significant patterns that also reflect different experimental situations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "To accurately predict rewards associated with states or actions, the variability of observations has to be taken into account. In particular, when the observations are noisy, the individual rewards should have less influence on tracking of average reward, and the estimate of the mean reward should be updated to a smaller extent after each observation. However, it is not known how the magnitude of the observation noise might be tracked and used to control prediction updates in the brain reward system. Here, we introduce a new model that uses simple, tractable learning rules that track the mean and standard deviation of reward, and leverages prediction errors scaled by uncertainty as the central feedback signal. We provide a normative analysis, comparing the performance of the new model with that of conventional models in a value tracking task. We find that the new model has an advantage over conventional models when tested across various levels of observation noise. Further, we propose a possible biological implementation of the model in the basal ganglia circuit. The scaled prediction error feedback signal is consistent with experimental findings concerning dopamine prediction error scaling relative to reward magnitude, and the update rules are found to be consistent with many features of striatal plasticity. Our results span across the levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation, and might have important implications for understanding the dopaminergic prediction error signal and its relation to adaptive and effective learning.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe basal ganglia system is a collection of subcortical nuclei in the mammalian brain. This system and its dopaminergic inputs are associated with learning from rewards. Here, dopamine is thought to signal errors in reward prediction. The structure and function of the basal ganglia system are not fully understood yet--for example, the basal ganglia are split into two antagonistic pathways, but the reason for this split and the role of the two pathways are unknown. Further, it has been found that under some circumstances, rewards of different sizes lead to dopamine responses of similar size, which cannot be explained with the reward prediction error theory. Here, we propose a new model of learning in the basal ganglia--the scaled prediction error model. According to our model, both reward average and reward uncertainty are tracked and represented in the two basal ganglia pathways. The learned reward uncertainty is then used to scale dopaminergic reward prediction errors, which effectively renders learning adaptive to reward noise. We show that such learning is more robust than learning from unscaled prediction errors and that it explains several physiological features of the basal ganglia system.",

SteD specifically localises at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and MHCII compartments; however, the targeting, membrane integration and trafficking of SteD are not understood. Using systematic mutagenesis, we identify distinct regions of SteD that are required for these processes. We show that SteD integrates into membranes of the ER/Golgi through a two-step mechanism of membrane recruitment from the cytoplasm followed by integration. SteD then migrates to and accumulates within the TGN. From here it hijacks the host adaptor protein (AP)1-mediated trafficking pathway from the TGN to MHCII compartments. AP1 binding and post-TGN trafficking require a short sequence in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of SteD that resembles the AP1-interacting dileucine sorting signal, but in inverted orientation, suggesting convergent evolution.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Macrophages (M{Phi}) are increasingly recognized as HIV-1 target cells involved in the pathogenesis and persistence of infection. Paradoxically, in vitro infection assays suggest that virus isolates are mostly T-cell-tropic and rarely M{Phi}-tropic. The latter are assumed to emerge under CD4+ T-cell paucity in tissues such as the brain or at late stage when the CD4 T-cell count declines. However, assays to qualify HIV-1 tropism use cell-free viral particles and may not fully reflect the conditions of in vivo M{Phi} infection through cell-to-cell viral transfer. Here, we investigated the capacity of viruses expressing primary envelope glycoproteins (Envs) with CCR5 and/or CXCR4 usage from different stages of infection, including transmitted/founder Envs, to infect M{Phi} by a cell-free mode and through cell-to-cell transfer from infected CD4+ T cells. The results show that most viruses were unable to enter M{Phi} as cell-free particles, in agreement with the current view that non-M-tropic viruses inefficiently use CD4 and/or CCR5 or CXCR4 entry receptors on M{Phi}. In contrast, all viruses could be effectively cell-to-cell transferred to M{Phi} from infected CD4+ T cells. We further showed that viral transfer proceeded through Env-dependent cell-cell fusion of infected T cells with M{Phi} targets, leading to the formation of productively infected multinucleated giant cells. Compared to cell-free infection, infected T-cell/M{Phi} contacts showed enhanced interactions of R5 M- and non-M-tropic Envs with CD4 and CCR5, resulting in a reduced dependence on receptor expression levels on M{Phi} for viral entry. Altogether, our results show that virus cell-to-cell transfer overcomes the entry block of isolates initially defined as non-macrophage-tropic, indicating that HIV-1 has a more prevalent tropism for M{Phi} than initially suggested. This sheds light into the role of this route of virus cell-to-cell transfer to M{Phi} in CD4+ T cell rich tissues for HIV-1 transmission, dissemination and formation of tissue viral reservoirs.\n\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding how HIV-1 hijacks the functions of immune cells to promote viral spreading remains a challenge in the fight against infection. M{Phi} are ubiquitous tissue-resident cells, involved in tissue homeostasis and immunity. In HIV-1 infection, along with CD4+ T lymphocytes, M{Phi} serve as vectors for virus dissemination and as viral reservoirs, impeding HIV-1 eradication. However, the mechanisms of their infection remain incompletely understood. A paradox is that infected M{Phi} are found in a large range of tissues whereas in vitro cellular tropism assays indicate that only a limited number of HIV-1 isolates can enter M{Phi}. We hypothesized that these assays, which evaluate infection using cell-free viruses, might not fully reflect the modes of M{Phi} infection in patients. We report here that virus cell-to-cell transfer through cell-cell fusion with infected CD4+ T cells is a very effective means of infecting M{Phi}, even with virus isolates characterized as non-macrophage tropic in cell-free infection. This intercellular viral transfer is facilitated by enhanced interactions between the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins and cellular entry receptors. We propose that M{Phi} infection through viral transfer from infected CD4+ T cells impacts different aspects of the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection, renewing our understanding of the role of M{Phi} in HIV-1 pathogenesis and persistence.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundMarburg virus (MARV), an Ebola-like virus, remains an eminent threat to public health as demonstrated by its high associated mortality rate (23-90%) and recent emergence in West Africa for the first time. Although a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine (Ervebo) is licensed for Ebola virus disease (EVD), no approved countermeasures exist against MARV. Results from clinical trials indicate Ervebo prevents EVD in 97.5-100% of vaccinees 10 days onwards post-immunization.\n\nMethodology/FindingsGiven the rapid immunogenicity of the Ervebo platform against EVD, we tested whether a similar, but highly attenuated, rVSV-based Vesiculovax vector expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of MARV (rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP) could provide swift protection against Marburg virus disease (MVD). Here, groups of cynomolgus monkeys were vaccinated 7, 5, or 3 days before exposure to a lethal dose of MARV (Angola variant). All subjects (100%) immunized one week prior to challenge survived; 80% and 20% of subjects survived when vaccinated 5- and 3-days pre-exposure, respectively. Lethality was associated with higher viral load and aberrant innate immunity signaling, whereas survival correlated with development of MARV GP-specific antibodies and early expression of NK cell-, B-cell-, and cytotoxic T-cell-related transcriptional signatures.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThese results emphasize the utility of Vesiculovax vaccines for MVD outbreak management. The highly attenuated nature of rVSV-N4CT1 vaccines, which are clinically safe in humans, may be preferable to vaccines based on the same platform as Ervebo (rVSV \"delta G\" platform), which in some trial participants induced vaccine-related adverse events in association with viral replication including arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis, and cutaneous vasculitis.\n\nAuthor SummaryMarburg virus (MARV) is one of the deadliest viruses known to man. One of the most effective vaccines against this pathogen uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) platform to express MARV glycoprotein (GP) immunogen. As rVSV-based vaccines may be used as medical interventions to mitigate or prevent outbreaks of MARV, defining the time window needed to elicit protection is vital. Here, a rVSV vector expressing MARV glycoprotein (rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP) fully protected nonhuman primates from lethality and disease when given as soon as 1 week prior to exposure. At 5- and 3-days pre-exposure, partial protection (80% and 20% survival, respectively) was achieved. Vaccination with rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP appears to \"jump-start\" the immune system to allow sufficient time for MARV-specific adaptive responses to form. This fast- acting vaccine is based on a similar platform as Ervebo, the only FDA- and EU-approved vaccine for preventing Ebola virus infection. The rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP vaccine features additional attenuations in the rVSV backbone that may contribute to a more acceptable safety profile in vaccinees, as Ervebo in some recipients induced vaccine- related adverse events including rashes and joint pain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundViral induction of neurological syndromes has been a concern since parkinsonian-like features were observed in patients diagnosed with encephalitis lethargica subsequent to the 1918 influenza pandemic. Given the similarities in the systemic responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection with those observed after pandemic influenza, there is a question if a similar syndrome of post-encephalic parkinsonism could follow COVID-19 infection.\n\nObjectivesTo determine if prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 increased sensitivity to a mitochondrial toxin known to induce parkinsonism.\n\nMethodshACE2 mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to induce mild to moderate disease. After 31 days recovery, mice were administered a non-lesion inducing dose of the parkinsonian toxin MPTP. Subsequent neuroinflammation and SNpc dopaminergic neuron loss was determined and compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone.\n\nResultshACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP showed no SNpc DA neuron loss following MPTP. In mice infected and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, MPTP induced a 23% or 19% greater loss of SNpc dopaminergic neurons than SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP, respectively (p{square}<{square}0.05).\n\nExamination of microglial activation showed a significant increase in the number of activated microglia in the SARS-CoV-2 + MPTP group compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone.\n\nConclusionsOur observations have important implications for long-term public health, given the number of people that have survived SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for future public policy regarding infection mitigation. However, it will be critical to determine if other agents known to increase risk of PD also have synergistic effects with SARS-CoV-2 and if are abrogated by vaccination.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by grant from the State of North Carolina (PS, JE, DOR, RJS) and R21 NS122280 (RJS).",

    "preprint_abstract": "Reproductive endocrine disorders are common comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Our previous studies using the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE demonstrated that many females show prolonged estrous cycles and hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons exhibit elevated firing during diestrus. However, it is unknown whether the degree of change in GnRH neuron activity is dependent on epilepsy severity. Here, we used 24/7 in vivo EEG and in vitro electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices to assess GnRH neuron firing in relation to chronic seizure burden in diestrous female mice at two months after IHKA injection. We found that percentage of time in seizure activity in the 24 hours prior to slice preparation is an accurate proxy of overall seizure burden. Firing rates of GnRH neurons from EEG-recorded IHKA mice were increased in comparison to controls, but no relationships were found between GnRH neuron firing and seizure burden measured in vivo. The independence of GnRH neuron firing rate in relation to seizure burden was unaffected by GnRH neuron soma location or estrous cycle length. Furthermore, GnRH neuron firing rates were not yet different from control values when measured 1 month after injection when epileptogenesis is already complete in IHKA mice. This result suggests a potential window for intervention to prevent epilepsy-associated GnRH neuron dysfunction. These findings indicate that the severity of epilepsy and the degree of downstream disruption to GnRH neuron activity are independent, suggesting that susceptibility to reproductive endocrine comorbidities is driven by other risk factors.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The prediction of protein mutations that affect function may be exploited for multiple uses. In the context of disease variants, the prediction of compensatory mutations that reestablish functional phenotypes could aid in the development of genetic therapies. In this work, we present an integrated approach that combines coevolutionary analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to discover functional compensatory mutations. This approach is employed to investigate possible rescue mutations of a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) variant, PARP1 V762A, associated with lung cancer and follicular lymphoma. MD simulations show PARP1 V762A exhibits noticeable changes in structural and dynamical behavior compared with wild type PARP1. Our integrated approach predicts A755E as a possible compensatory mutation based on coevolutionary information, and molecular simulations indicate that the PARP1 A755E/V762A double mutant exhibits similar structural and dynamical behavior to WT PARP1. Our methodology can be broadly applied to a large number of systems where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as connected to disease and can shed light on the biophysical effects of such changes as well as provide a way to discover potential mutants that could restore wild type-like functionality. This can in turn be further utilized in the design of molecular therapeutics that aim to mimic such compensatory effect.\n\nSignificance StatementDiscovering protein mutations with desired phenotypes can be challenging due to its combinatorial nature. Herein we employ a methodology combining gene SNP association to disease, direct coupling analysis and molecular dynamics simulations to systematically predict rescue mutations. Our workflow identifies A755E as a potential rescue for the PARP1 V762A mutation, which has been associated with cancer. This methodology is general and can be applied broadly.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Patterning of the anterior-posterior axis is fundamental to animal development. The Wnt pathway plays a major role in this process by activating the expression of posterior genes in animals from worms to humans. This observation raises the question of whether the Wnt pathway or other regulators control the expression of the many anterior-expressed genes. We found that the expression of five anterior-specific genes in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos depends on the Wnt pathway effectors pop-1/TCF and sys-1/{beta}-catenin. We focused further on one of these anterior genes, ref-2/ZIC, a conserved transcription factor expressed in multiple anterior lineages. Live imaging of ref-2 mutant embryos identified defects in cell division timing and position in anterior lineages. Cis-regulatory dissection identified three ref-2 transcriptional enhancers, one of which is necessary and sufficient for anterior-specific expression. This enhancer is activated by the T-box transcription factors TBX-37 and TBX-38, and surprisingly, concatemerized TBX-37/38 binding sites are sufficient to drive anterior-biased expression alone, despite the broad expression of TBX-37 and TBX-38. Taken together, our results highlight the diverse mechanisms used to regulate anterior expression patterns in the embryo.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472681v6_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@412c25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b944c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1511cedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@420d4e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we suggest a strategy for learning DBNs from gene expression data by employing a Bayesian approach that is scalable to large networks and is targeted at learning models with high predictive accuracy. Our framework can be used to learn DBNs for multiple groups of samples and highlight differences and similarities in their gene regulatory networks. We learn these DBN models based on different structural and parametric assumptions and select the optimal model based on the cross-validated predictive accuracy. We show in simulation studies that our approach is better equipped to prevent overfitting than techniques used in previous studies. We applied the proposed DBN-based classification approach to two time series transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, each comprising data from distinct phenotypic groups of the same tissue type. In the first case, we used DBNs to characterize responders and non-responders to anti-cancer therapy. In the second case, we compared normal to tumor cells of colorectal tissue. The classification accuracy reached by the DBN-based classifier for both datasets was higher than reported previously. For the colorectal cancer dataset, our analysis suggested that GRNs for cancer and normal tissues have a lot of differences, which are most pronounced in the neighborhoods of oncogenes and known cancer tissue markers. The identified differences in gene networks of cancer and normal cells may be used for the discovery of targeted therapies.",

Nearly one-third of known protein structures contain metal ions that are used for a variety of needs, such as catalysis, DNA/RNA binding, protein structure stability, etc. Identifying metal-binding proteins is thus crucial for understanding the mechanisms of cellular activity. However, experimental annotation of protein metal-binding potential is severely lacking, while computational techniques are often imprecise and of limited applicability.\n\nWe developed a novel machine learning-based method, mebipred, for identifying metal-binding proteins from sequence-derived features. This method is nearly 90% accurate in recognizing proteins that bind metal ions and ion containing ligands. Moreover, the identity of ten ubiquitously present metal ions and ion-containing ligands can be annotated. mebipred is reference-free, i.e. no sequence alignments are involved, and outperforms other prediction methods, both in speed and accuracy. mebipred can also identify protein metal-binding capabilities from short sequence stretches and, thus, may be useful for the annotation of metagenomic samples metal requirements inferred from translated sequencing reads. We performed an analysis of microbiome data and found that ocean, hot spring sediments and soil microbiomes use a more diverse set of metals than human host-related ones. For human-hosted microbiomes, physiological conditions explain the observed metal preferences. Similarly, subtle changes in ocean sample ion concentration affect the abundance of relevant metal-binding proteins. These results are highlight mebipreds utility in analyzing microbiome metal requirements.\n\nmebipred is available as a web server at services.bromberglab.org/mebipred and as a standalone package at https://pypi.org/project/mymetal/",

A comparative analysis of this broader FaNaC family and other channels from the overarching DEG/ENaC superfamily, incorporating mutagenesis and experimental dissection of function, identified a pocket of amino acid residues that determines activation of FaNaCs by neuropeptides. Although this pocket has diverged in distantly related DEG/ENaC channels that are activated by other ligands, such as mammalian acid-sensing ion channels, we show that it nonetheless contains residues that determine enhancement of those channels by similar peptides.

Using publicly available BAL scRNAseq datasets, we found that ISG and MT AMs are associated with more severe inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Analysis of cells from four explanted CLAD lungs revealed similar macrophage populations. Using a single nucleotide variation calling algorithm, we also demonstrated contributions of donor and recipient cells to all AM subsets early post-transplant, with loss of donor-derived cells over time.

Adipocytes were differentiated and analyzed with various assays of adipogenesis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, inflammation, and respiration.\n\nResultsLoss of Psmb4, but not Psmb8, disrupted proteostasis and adipogenesis. Proteasome function was reduced upon Psmb4 loss, but partly recovered by the activation of Nuclear factor, erythroid-2, like-1 (Nfe2l1). In addition, cells displayed higher levels of surrogate inflammation and stress markers, including Activating transcription factor-3 (Atf3). Simultaneous silencing of Psmb4 and Atf3 lowered inflammation and restored adipogenesis.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows that Psmb4 is required for adipocyte development and function in cultured adipocytes. These results imply that in humans with PSMB4 mutations, PRAAS-associated lipodystrophy is partly caused by disturbed adipogenesis. While we uncover a role for Nfe2l1 in the maintenance of proteostasis under these conditions, Atf3 is a key effector of inflammation and blocking adipogenesis. In conclusion, our work highlights how proteasome dysfunction is sensed and mitigated by the integrated stress response in adipocytes with potential relevance for PRAAS patients and beyond.\n\nHighlights- PRAAS-associated PSMB4 is required for brown adipocyte differentiation\n- Loss of PSMB4 activates NFE2L1 to counteract proteasome dysfunction\n- The ATF3 pathway regulates adipocyte dysfunction and inflammation\n- Loss of ATF3 restores adipogenesis in cells with loss of PSMB4\n\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476367v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c9c5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae0674org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29c741org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d8a584_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

A particularly strong relationship exists between the side of seizure focus and the propensity for distinct reproductive endocrine comorbidities in women with TLE. Therefore, here we evaluated whether targeting of left or right dorsal hippocampus for intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) injection, a model of TLE, produces different outcomes in hippocampal granule cell dispersion, body weight gain, and multiple measures of reproductive endocrine dysfunction in female mice. One, two, and four months after IHKA or saline injection, in vivo measurements of estrous cycles and weight were followed by ex vivo examination of hippocampal dentate granule cell dispersion, circulating ovarian hormone and corticosterone levels, ovarian morphology, and pituitary gene expression. IHKA mice with right-targeted injection (IHKA-R) showed greater granule cell dispersion and pituitary Fshb expression compared to mice with left-targeted injection (IHKA-L). By contrast, pituitary expression of Lhb and Gnrhr were higher in IHKA-L mice compared to IHKA-R, but these values were not different from respective saline-injected controls. IHKA-L mice also showed an increased rate of weight gain compared to IHKA-R mice. Increases in estrous cycle length, however, were similar in both IHKA-L and IHKA-R mice. These findings indicate that although major reproductive endocrine dysfunction phenotypes present similarly after targeting left or right dorsal hippocampus for IHKA injection, distinct underlying mechanisms based on lateralization of epileptogenic insult may contribute to produce similar emergent reproductive endocrine outcomes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGreater granule cell dispersion with right-sided IHKA injection\nC_LIO_LIChanges in pituitary gene expression vary with side of injection\nC_LIO_LIIncreased weight gain after left-sided injection\nC_LIO_LISimilar estrous cycle disruption after injection of left or right hippocampus\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "The insula plays a fundamental role in a wide range of adaptive human behaviors, but its electrophysiological dynamics are poorly understood. Here we used human intracranial electroencephalographic recordings to investigate the electrophysiological properties and hierarchical organization of spontaneous neuronal oscillations within the insula. We analyzed the neuronal oscillations of the insula directly and found that rhythms in the theta and beta frequency oscillations are widespread and spontaneously present. These oscillations are largely organized along the anterior-posterior axis of the insula. Both the left and right insula showed anterior-to-posterior decreasing gradients for the power of oscillations in the beta frequency band. The left insula also showed a posterior-to-anterior decreasing frequency gradient and an anterior-to-posterior decreasing power gradient in the theta frequency band. In addition to measuring the power of these oscillations, we also examined the phase of these signals across simultaneous recording channels and found that the insula oscillations in the theta and beta bands are traveling waves. The strength of the traveling waves in each frequency was positively correlated with the amplitude of each oscillation. However, the theta and beta traveling waves were uncoupled to each other in terms of phase and amplitude, which suggested that insula traveling waves in the theta and beta bands operate independently. Our findings provide new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics and hierarchical organization of neuronal oscillations within the insula, which, given its rich connectivity with widespread cortical regions, indicates that oscillations and traveling waves have an important role in intra- and inter-insula communication.",

Characterising the current in vitro protocols of myelopoiesis is imperative for their use in research and immunotherapy as well as for understanding the early stages of myeloid differentiation in humans. Here, we profiled the transcriptome of more than 400k cells and generated a robust molecular map of the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into macrophages. By integrating our in vitro datasets with in vivo single-cell developmental atlases, we found that in vitro macrophage differentiation recapitulates features of in vivo yolk sac hematopoiesis, which happens prior to the appearance of definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). During in vitro myelopoiesis, a wide range of myeloid cells are generated, including erythrocytes, mast cells and monocytes, suggesting that, during early human development, the HSC-independent immune wave gives rise to multiple myeloid cell lineages. We leveraged this model to characterize the transition of hemogenic endothelium into myeloid cells, uncovering poorly described myeloid progenitors and regulatory programs. Taking advantage of the variety of myeloid cells produced, we developed a new protocol to produce type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in vitro. We found that the underlying regulatory networks coding for myeloid identity are conserved in vivo and in vitro. Using genetic engineering techniques, we validated the effects of key transcription factors important for cDC2 and macrophage identity and ontogeny. This roadmap of early myeloid differentiation will serve as an important resource for investigating the initial stages of hematopoiesis, which are largely unexplored in humans, and will open up new therapeutic opportunities.",

Spreading re-establishes gene-poor constitutive heterochromatin every cell cycle, but also invades gene-rich euchromatin de novo to steer cell fate decisions. How chromatin context, i.e. euchromatic, heterochromatic, or different nucleator types, influences the determinants of this process remains poorly understood. By screening a nuclear function gene deletion library in fission yeast using a previously established heterochromatin spreading sensor system, we identified regulators that positively or negatively alter the propensity of a nucleation site to spread heterochromatin. We find that different chromatin contexts are dependent on unique sets of genes for the regulation of heterochromatin spreading. Further, we find that spreading in constitutive heterochromatin requires Clr6 histone deacetylase complexes containing the Fkh2 transcription factor, while the Clr3 deacetylase is globally required for silencing. Fkh2 acts by recruiting Clr6 to nucleation-distal chromatin sites. Our results segregate the pathways that control lateral heterochromatin spreading from those that instruct DNA-directed assembly in nucleation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The transformation of sensory inputs into behavioral outputs is characterized by an interplay between feedforward and feedback operations in cortical hierarchies. Even in simple sensorimotor transformations, recurrent processing is often expressed in primary cortices in a late phase of the cortical response to sensory stimuli. This late phase is engaged by attention and stimulus complexity, and also encodes sensory-independent factors, including movement and report-related variables. However, despite its pervasiveness, the nature and function of late activity in perceptual decision-making remain unclear. We tested whether the function of late activity depends on the complexity of a sensory change-detection task. Complexity was based on increasing processing requirements for the same sensory stimuli. We found that the temporal window in which V1 is necessary for perceptual decision-making was extended when we increased task complexity, independently of the presented visual stimulus. This window overlapped with the emergence of report-related activity and decreased noise correlations in V1. The onset of these co-occurring activity patterns was time-locked to and preceded reaction time, and predicted the reduction in behavioral performance obtained by optogenetically silencing late V1 activity (>200 ms after stimulus onset), a result confirmed by a second multisensory task with different requirements. Thus, although early visual response components encode all sensory information necessary to solve the task, V1 is not simply relaying information to higher-order areas transforming it into behavioral responses. Rather, task complexity determines the temporal extension of a loop of recurrent activity, which overlaps with report-related activity and determines how perceptual decisions are built.",

Intraepithelial CD4+ T cells recruited after MNV or AdV infection co-express Ly6A and CCR9, and exhibit T helper 1 and cytotoxic profiles. Although these cells display a diverse TCR repertoire, they conferred protection against AdV and MNV both in vivo and in an organoid co-culture model in an IFN-{gamma}-dependent manner.

    "preprint_abstract": "Recombination is critical both for accelerating adaptation and for the purging of deleterious mutations. Chromosomal inversions can act as recombination modifiers that suppress local recombination and, thus, are predicted to accumulate such mutations. In this study, we investigated patterns of recombination, transposable element abundance and coding sequence evolution across the genomes of 1,445 individuals from three sunflower species, as well as within nine inversions segregating within species. We also analyzed the effects of inversion genotypes on 87 phenotypic traits to test for overdominance. We found significant negative correlations of long terminal repeat retrotransposon abundance and deleterious mutations with recombination rates across the genome in all three species. However, we failed to detect an increase in these features in the inversions, except for a modest increase in the proportion of stop codon mutations in several very large or rare inversions. Moreover, there was little evidence of phenotypic overdominance in inversion heterozygotes, consistent with observations of minimal deleterious load. On the other hand, significantly greater load was observed for inversions in populations polymorphic for a given inversion compared to populations monomorphic for one of the arrangements, suggesting that the local state of inversion polymorphism affects deleterious load. These seemingly contradictory results can be explained by the geographic structuring and consequent excess homozygosity of inversions in wild sunflowers. Inversions contributing to local adaptation often exhibit geographic structure; such inversions represent ideal recombination modifiers, acting to facilitate adaptive divergence with gene flow, while largely averting the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to recombination suppression.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus) is an important fishery species with widespread distribution around New Zealand and off the southern coasts of Australia. However, little is known about whether the populations are locally adapted or genetically structured. To address this, we conducted whole-genome resequencing of 175 tarakihi from around New Zealand and Tasmania (Australia) to obtain a dataset of 7.5 million genome-wide and high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Variant filtering, FST-outlier analysis, and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to evaluate population structure, adaptive structure, and locus-environment associations. A weak but significant level of neutral genetic differentiation was found between tarakihi from New Zealand and Tasmania (FST = 0.0054-0.0073, P [&le;] 0.05), supporting the existence of at least two separate reproductive stocks. No clustering was detected among the New Zealand populations ([FE]ST < 0.001, P = 0.77). Outlier-based, presumably adaptive variation suggests fine-scale adaptive structure between locations around central New Zealand off the east (Wairarapa, Cape Campbell, and Hawkes Bay) and the west coast (Tasman Bay/Golden Bay and Upper West Coast of South Island). Allele frequencies from 55 loci were associated with at least one of six environmental variables, of which 47 correlated strongly with yearly mean water temperature. Although genes associated with these loci are linked to various functions, the most common functions were integral components of membrane and cilium assembly. Projection of the RDA indicates the existence of a latitudinal temperature cline. Our work provides the first genomic insights supporting panmixia of tarakihi in New Zealand and evidence of a genomic cline that appears to be driven by the temperature gradients, together providing crucial information to inform the stock assessment of this species, and to widen the insights of the ecological drivers of adaptive variation in a marine species.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Inherited microorganisms can selfishly manipulate host reproduction to drive through populations. In Drosophila melanogaster, germline expression of the native Wolbachia prophage WO proteins CifA and CifB cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in which embryos from infected males and uninfected females suffer catastrophic mitotic defects and lethality; however, in infected females, CifA expression rescues the embryonic lethality and thus imparts a fitness advantage to the maternally-transmitted Wolbachia. Despite widespread relevance to sex determination, evolution, and vector control, the mechanisms underlying when and how CI impairs male reproduction remain unknown and a topic of debate. Here we use cytochemical, microscopic, and transgenic assays in D. melanogaster to demonstrate that CifA and CifB proteins of wMel localize to nuclear DNA throughout the process of spermatogenesis. Cif proteins cause abnormal histone retention in elongating spermatids and protamine deficiency in mature sperms that travel to the female reproductive tract with Cif proteins. Notably, protamine gene knockouts enhance wild type CI. In ovaries, CifA localizes to germ cell nuclei and cytoplasm of early-stage egg chambers, however Cifs are absent in late-stage oocytes and subsequently in fertilized embryos. Finally, CI and rescue are contingent upon a newly annotated CifA bipartite nuclear localization sequence. Together, our results strongly support the Host Modification model of CI in which Cifs initially modify the paternal and maternal gametes to bestow CI-defining embryonic lethality and rescue.",

We observed widespread single-cell representations of social gaze interaction functionalities in these brain regions - social discriminability, social gaze monitoring, and mutual eye contact selectivity. Many of these neurons discriminated looking at social versus non-social stimuli with rich temporal heterogeneity, or parametrically tracked the gaze positions of oneself or the conspecific. Furthermore, many neurons displayed selectivity for mutual eye contact as a function of the initiator or follower of mutual gaze events. Crucially, a significant proportion of neurons coded for more than one of these three signatures of social gaze interaction, supporting the recruitment of partially overlapping neuronal ensembles.

    "preprint_abstract": "The progression of tumorigenesis starts with a few mutational and structural driver events in the cell. Various cohort-based computational tools exist to identify driver genes but require a large number of samples to produce reliable results. Many studies use different methods to identify driver mutations/genes from mutations that have no impact on tumour progression; however, a small fraction of patients show no mutational events in any known driver genes. Current unsupervised methods map somatic and expression data onto a network to identify the perturbation in the network. Our method is the first machine learning model to classify genes as tumour suppressor gene (TSG), oncogene (OG) or neutral, thus assigning the functional impact of the gene in the patient. In this study, we develop a multi-omic approach, PIVOT (Personalised Identification of driVer OGs and TSGs), to train on experimentally or computationally validated mutational and structural driver events. Given the lack of any gold standards for the identification of personalised driver genes, we label the data using four strategies and, based on classification metrics, show gene-based labelling strategies perform best. We build different models using SNV, RNA, and multi-omic features to be used based on the data available. Our models trained on multi-omic data improved predictions compared to mutation and expression data, achieving an accuracy [&ge;] 0.99 for BRCA, LUAD and COAD datasets. We show network and expression-based features contribute the most to PIVOT. Our predictions on BRCA, COAD and LUAD cancer types reveal commonly altered genes such as TP53, and PIK3CA, which are predicted drivers for multiple cancer types. Along with known driver genes, our models also identify new driver genes such as PRKCA, SOX9 and PSMD4. Our multi-omic model labels both CNV and mutations with a more considerable contribution by CNV alterations. While predicting labels for genes mutated in multiple samples, we also label rare driver events occurring in as few as one sample. We also identify genes with dual roles within the same cancer type. Overall, PIVOT labels personalised driver genes as TSGs and OGs and also identifies rare driver genes.\n\nPIVOT is available at https://github.com/RamanLab/PIVOT.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Current knowledge of plant viruses stems largely from those affecting economically important plants. Yet, plant species in cultivation represent a small and bias subset of the plant kingdom. Here, we describe virus diversity and abundance from a survey of 1079 transcriptomes from species across the breadth of the plant kingdom (Archaeplastida) by analysing open-source data from the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative (1KP). We identified 104 potentially novel viruses, of which 40% comprised single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses across eight orders, including members of the Hepelivirales, Tymovirales, Cryppavirales, Martellivirales and Picornavirales. One-third of the newly described viruses comprised double-stranded RNA viruses from the orders Durnavirales and Ghabrivirales. The remaining were negative-sense RNA viruses from the Rhabdoviridae, Aspiviridae, Yueviridae, Phenuiviridae and the newly proposed Viridisbunyaviridae. Our analysis considerably expands the known host range of 13 virus families to include lower plants (e.g., Benyviridae and Secoviridae) and four virus families to include algae hosts (e.g., Tymoviridae and Chrysoviridae). The discovery of the first 30 kDa movement protein in a non-vascular plant, suggests that the acquisition of plant virus movement proteins occurred prior to the emergence of the plant vascular system. More broadly, however, a co-phylogeny analysis revealed that the evolutionary history of these families is largely driven by cross-species transmission events. Together, these data highlight that numerous RNA virus families are associated with older evolutionary plant lineages than previously thought and that the scarcity of RNA viruses found in lower plants to date likely reflects a lack of investigation rather than their absence.\n\nImportanceOur knowledge of plant viruses is mainly limited to those infecting economically important host species. In particular, we know little about those viruses infecting primitive plant lineages such as the ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes and charophytes. To expand this understanding, we conducted a broad-scale viral survey of species across the breadth of the plant kingdom. We find that primitive plants harbour a wide diversity of RNA viruses including some that are sufficiently divergent to comprise a new virus family. The primitive plant virome we reveal offers key insights into the evolutionary history of core plant virus gene modules and genome segments. More broadly, this work emphasises that the scarcity of viruses found in these species to date likely reflects the absence of research in this area.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Eukaryal cells are used for the production of many recombinant pharmaceutical proteins, including several of the current top-selling products. The protein secretory pathway in eukaryal cells is complex and involves many different processes such as post-translational modifications, translocation, and folding. Furthermore, recombinant protein production competes with native secretory proteins for the limited energy and proteome resources allocated to the protein secretory pathway. Due to the complexity of this pathway, improvement through metabolic engineering has traditionally been relatively ad-hoc; and considering the industrial importance of this pathway, there is a need for more systematic approaches for novel design principles. Here, we present the first proteome-constrained genome-scale protein secretory model of a eukaryal cell, namely for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pcSecYeast). The model contains all key processes of this pathway, i.e., protein translation, modification, and degradation coupled with metabolism. The model can capture delicate phenotypic changes such as the switch in the use of specific glucose transporters in response to changing extracellular glucose concentration. Furthermore, the model can also simulate the effects of protein misfolding on cellular growth, suggesting that retro-translocation of misfolded proteins contributes to protein retention in the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We used pcSecYeast to simulate various recombinant proteins production and identified overexpression targets for different recombinant proteins overproduction. We experimentally validated many of the predicted targets for -amylase production in this study, and the results show that the secretory pathways have more limited capacity than metabolism in terms of protein secretion.",
