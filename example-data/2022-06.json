    "preprint_abstract": "Activity-induced neurogenesis has been extensively studied in rodents but the lack of ante mortem accessibility to human brain at the cellular and molecular levels limits studies of the process in humans. Using cerebral spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we investigated the effects of increased neuronal activity on neurogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that increasing neuronal activity with 4-aminopyridine in 3-month-old cerebral spheroids is associated with increases in the numbers of new neurons and decreases in the population of new glial cells. We also observed a significant decrease in the expression of miR-135a, which has previously been shown to be decreased in exercise-induced neurogenesis. Predicted targets of miR-135a include key participants in the SMAD2/3 and BDNF pathways. Together, our results suggest that iPSC-derived cerebral spheroids are an attractive model to study some aspects of activity-induced neurogenesis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Flaviviruses comprise a large group of arboviral species that are distributed in several countries of the tropics, neotropics, and some temperate zones. Since they can produce neurological pathologies or vascular damage, there has been intense research seeking better diagnosis and treatments for their infections in the last decades. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a relevant clinical target because it is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. Being a key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus to reprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1 oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, and West Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysical simulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for different oligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins can form both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH even without the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainly controlling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern their association. Finally, despite the similarity at the sequence level, we found that each flavivirus has a well-characteristic protein-protein interaction profile. These specific features can provide new hints for the development of binders both for better diagnostic tools and the formulation of new therapeutic drugs.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484429v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1221d69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b90429org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c039c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1039cc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Shifts in host body temperature resulting from climate change have the potential to shape ectotherm microbiome composition. Microbiome compositional changes occurring in response to temperature in nature have not been frequently examined, restricting our ability to predict microbe-mediated ectotherm responses to climate change. In a set of field-based observations, we characterized gut bacterial communities and thermal exposure across a population of desert arboreal ants (Cephalotes rohweri). In a paired growth chamber experiment, we exposed ant colonies to variable temperature regimes differing by 5 {degrees}C for three months. We found that the abundance and composition of ant-associated bacteria were sensitive to elevated temperatures in both field and laboratory experiments. We observed a subset of taxa that responded similarly to temperature in the experimental and observational study, suggesting a role of seasonal temperature and local temperature differences amongst nests in shaping microbiomes within the ant population. Bacterial mutualists in the genus Cephalotococcus (Opitutales: Opitutaceae) were especially sensitive to change in temperature--decreasing in abundance in naturally warm summer nests and warm growth chambers. We also report the discovery of a member of the Candidate Phlya Radiation (Phylum: Gracilibacteria), a suspected epibiont, found in low abundance within the guts of this ant species.",

The active component in some of these game-changing medicines are autologous T-cells that express viral vector-delivered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which specifically target proteins that are preferentially expressed on cancer cells. Some of these therapeutic CAR expressing T-cells (CAR-Ts) are engineered via transduction with {gamma}-retroviral vectors ({gamma}-RVVs) produced in a stable producer cell line that was derived from murine PG13 packaging cells (ATCC CRL-10686). Earlier studies reported on the co-packaging of murine virus-like 30S RNA (VL30) genomes with {gamma}-retroviral vectors generated in murine stable packaging cells. In an earlier study VL30 mRNA was found to enhance the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. These findings raise biosafety concerns regarding the possibility that therapeutic CAR-Ts have been inadvertently contaminated with potentially oncogenic VL30 retrotransposons. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of infectious VL30 particles in PG13 cells conditioned media and observed the ability of these particles to deliver transcriptionally active VL30 genomes to human cells. Notably, VL30 genomes packaged by HIV-1-based vector particles transduced naive human cells in culture. Furthermore, we detected transfer and expression of VL30 genomes in clinical-grade CAR-Ts generated by transduction with PG13 cells-derived {gamma}-retroviral vectors. Our findings raise biosafety concerns regarding the use of murine packaging cell lines in ongoing clinical applications.",

In this study, we introduce and validate a novel, wipe-based approach to fecal sample collection and stabilization for metagenomics analysis. A total of 72 samples were collected across four different preservation types: freezing at -20{degrees}C, room temperature storage, a commercial DNA preservation kit, and DESS (dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium chloride) solution. These samples were sequenced and analyzed for taxonomic abundance metrics, metabolic pathway classification, and diversity analysis. Overall, the DESS wipe results validated the use of a wipe-based capture method to collect stool samples for microbiome analysis, showing an R2 of 0.96 for species across all kingdoms, as well as exhibiting a maintenance of Shannon diversity (3.1-3.3) and species richness (151-159) compared to frozen samples. Moreover, DESS showed comparable performance to the commercially available preservation kit (R2 of 0.98), and samples consistently clustered by subject across each method. Future studies will be needed to further explore sample processing options and their applications in non-healthy subjects, particularly patients with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer, but these data suggest the DESS wipe method can be used for stable, room temperature collection and transport of human stool specimens.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The mammalian X chromosome shows strong conservation among distantly related species, limiting insights into the distinct selective processes that have shaped sex chromosome evolution. We constructed a chromosome-scale de novo genome assembly for the Siberian dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus), a species reported to show extensive recombination suppression across an entire arm of the X chromosome. Combining a physical genome assembly based on shotgun and long-range proximity ligation sequencing with a dense genetic map, we detected widespread suppression of female recombination across [~]65% of the Phodopus X chromosome. This region of suppressed recombination likely corresponds to the Xp arm, which has previously been shown to be highly heterochromatic. Using additional sequencing data from two closely-related species (P. campbelli and P. roborovskii), we show that recombination suppression on Xp appears to be independent of major structural rearrangements. The suppressed Xp arm was enriched for several transposable element families and de-enriched for genes primarily expressed in the placenta, but otherwise showed similar gene densities, expression patterns, and rates of molecular evolution when compared to the recombinant Xq arm. Phodopus Xp gene content and order was also broadly conserved relative to the more distantly related rat X chromosome. Collectively, these data suggest that widespread suppression of recombination has likely evolved through the transient induction of facultative heterochromatin on the Phodopus Xp arm without major changes in chromosome structure or genetic content. Thus, dramatic changes in the recombination landscape have so far had relatively subtle influences on overall patterns of X-linked molecular evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementSex chromosome evolution represents a dynamic process of genomic specialization that is thought to be dependent on evolution of recombination. Here we use genome sequencing and genetic mapping to show that one arm comprising the majority of the X chromosome in a species of dwarf hamster has largely lost the ability to recombine in males and females. Although these dramatic shifts in recombination frequencies might eventually lead to sex chromosome degeneration, loss of recombination on this arm is associated with relatively minor changes in chromosome structure and gene contents in this species. These results underscore the conservation of the X chromosome across mammals, and allow us to test predictions about how genetic recombination influences sex chromosome evolution.",

Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed regarding: i) thymic function surrogates [T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and recent thymic emigrants (RTEs)]; ii) naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subsets; iii) T helper (Th) phenotype and chemokine receptors expression on T cells subsets; iv) regulatory T cell (Tregs) phenotype; and vi) expression of activating/inhibitory receptors by natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IgG seroprevalence.\n\nResultsNewly diagnosed RRMS patients and HC have equivalent thymic function as determined by similar numbers of RTEs, and levels of sjTRECs, DJ{beta}TRECs and sj/DJ{beta}TREC ratio. In the CD8+ T cells compartment RRMS patients have a higher naive/memory ratio and lower memory cell counts in blood, specifically of effector memory and TemRA CD8+ T cells. Among CD4+ T cells lower blood counts of effector memory cells are found in patients upon controlling for sex, age and HCMV IgG seroprevalence. RRMS patients have higher percentage of naive Tregs comparing to HC. Percentages of immature CD56bright NK cells expressing the inhibitory receptor KLRG1, and of mature CD56dimCD57+ NK cells expressing NKp30 are higher in patients. No major alterations are observed on NKT cells. MS severity and time from relapse correlate with immune cells alterations.\n\nConclusionCharacterization of the peripheral immune system of treatment-naive newly diagnosed RRMS patients unveiled immune features present at clinical onset including lower memory T cells blood counts, particularly among CD8+ T cells, higher percentage of naive Tregs and altered percentages of NK cells subsets expressing inhibitory or activating receptors.

However, there is little information on how nutrition interacts with sex ratio to influence the evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory traits separately. To address this omission, here we test how male mating success and reproductive investment evolve under varying sex ratios and adult diet in Drosophila melanogaster using an experimental evolution approach. We found that sex ratio and nutrient availability interacted to determine male pre-copulatory performance. Males from female-biased populations were slow to mate when they evolved on a protein-restricted diet. On the other hand, we found direct and non-interacting effects of sex ratio and nutrient availability on post-copulatory success, without interactions between them. Males that evolved on a protein-restricted diet were poor at suppressing female remating. Males that evolved under equal sex ratios fathered more offspring and were better at supressing female remating, relative to males from male-biased or female-biased populations. These results support the idea that sex ratios and nutrition interact to determine the evolution of pre-copulatory mating traits, but independently influence the evolution of post-copulatory traits.",

A large fraction of protein-protein interactions involves domain and so-called SLiMs (for Short Linear Motifs). Often, SLiMs lie in disordered regions or loops. Their small size and loosely folded nature prevent straightforward detection. SLiMAn (Short Linear Motif Analysis), a new web server is provided to help thorough analysis of interactomics data. Starting from a list of putative interactants such as the output of an interactomics study, SLiMs (from ELM) and SLiM-recognition domains (from Pfam) are extracted and potential pairing are displayed. Additionally, filters are available to dig into the predicted results such as the motif E-value, IUpred2 scoring functions for disorder or BioGRID interaction matches. When structural templates are available, a given SLiM and its recognition domain can be modeled using SCWRL. We illustrate, here, the use of SLiMAn on three distinct examples including one real-case study. We oversee wide-range applications for SLiMAn in the context of massive analysis of protein-protein interactions at proteome-wide scale.

These efforts allow researchers to address questions in both basic and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. There are now over 300 peer-reviewed publications containing IPMs. We describe a novel framework to quickly reconstruct these models for subsequent analyses using Rpadrino R package, which serves as an interface to PADRINO, a new database of structured population models.\nC_LIO_LIWe introduce an R package, Rpadrino, which enables users to download, subset, reconstruct, and extend published IPMs. Rpadrino makes use of recently created software, ipmr, to provide an engine to reconstruct a wide array of IPMs from their symbolic representations and conduct subsequent analyses. Rpadrino and ipmr are extensively documented to help users learn their usage.\nC_LIO_LIRpadrino currently enables users to reconstruct 280 IPMs from 40 publications that describe the demography of 14 animal and 26 plant species.

The parasite undergoes huge changes in morphology and metabolism as it adapts to each host environment. These changes are reflected in the differing transcriptomes of parasites living in each host. While changes in the transcriptome have been well catalogued for parasites differentiating from the mammalian bloodstream to the insect stage, it remains unclear whether chromatin interacting proteins mediate transcriptomic changes during life cycle adaptation. We and others have shown that chromatin interacting bromodomain proteins localize to transcription start sites in bloodstream parasites, but whether the localization of bromodomain proteins changes as parasites differentiate from bloodstream to insect stage parasites remains unknown. To address this question, we performed Cleavage Under Target and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) timecourse experiments using a tagged version of Bromodomain Protein 3 (Bdf3) in parasites differentiating from bloodstream to insect stage forms. We found that Bdf3 occupancy at most loci increased at 3 hours following onset of differentiation and decreased thereafter. A number of sites with increased bromodomain protein occupancy lie proximal to genes known to have altered transcript levels during differentiation, such as procyclins, procyclin associated genes, and invariant surface glycoproteins. While most Bdf3 occupied sites are observed throughout differentiation, a very small number appear de novo as differentiation progresses. Notably, one such site lies proximal to the procyclin gene locus, which contains genes essential for remodeling surface proteins following transition to the insect stage. Overall, these studies indicate that occupancy of chromatin interacting proteins is dynamic during life cycle stage transitions, and provides the groundwork for future studies aimed at uncovering whether changes in bromodomain protein occupancy affect transcript levels of neighboring genes. Additionally, the optimization of CUT&RUN for use in Trypanosoma brucei may prove helpful for other researchers as an alternative to Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP).",

    "preprint_abstract": "Among the adaptive capacities of animals, the management of energetic body reserves (BR) through the BR mobilization and accretion processes (BR dynamics, BRD) has become an increasingly valuable attribute for livestock sustainability, allowing animals to cope with more variable environments. BRD has previously been reported to be heritable in ruminants. In the present study, we conducted genome-wide studies (GWAS) in sheep to determine genetic variants associated with BRD. BR levels and BR changes over time were obtained through body condition score measurements at eight physiological stages throughout each productive cycle in Romane ewes (n=1034) and were used as phenotypes for GWAS. After quality controls and imputation, 48,513 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were included in the GWAS. Among the QTLs identified, a major QTL associated with BR levels during pregnancy and lactation was identified on chromosome 1. In this region, several significant SNPs mapped to the leptin receptor gene (LEPR), among which one SNP mapped to the coding sequence. The point mutation induces the p.P1019S substitution in the cytoplasmic domain, close to tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The frequency of the SNP associated with increased BR levels was 32%, and the LEPR genotype explained up to 5% of the variance of the trait. These results provide strong evidence for involvement of LEPR in the regulation of BRD in sheep and highlight it as a major candidate for improving adaptive capacities.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundGenomic organization and gene expression regulation in trypanosomes are remarkable because protein-coding genes are organized into codirectional gene clusters with unrelated functions. Moreover, there is no dedicated promoter for each gene, resulting in polycistronic gene transcription, with posttranscriptional control playing a major role. Nonetheless, these parasites harbor epigenetic modifications at critical regulatory genome features that dynamically change among parasite stages, which are not fully understood.\n\nResultsHere, we investigated the impact of chromatin changes in a scenario commanded by posttranscriptional control exploring the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and its differentiation program using genome-wide approaches supported by transmission electron microscopy. The integration of FAIRE and MNase-seq data, two complementary epigenomic approaches, enabled us to identify differences in T. cruzi genome compartments, putative transcriptional start regions and virulence factors. In addition, we also detected developmental chromatin regulation at tRNA loci (tDNA), which seems to be linked to the translation regulatory mechanism required for parasite differentiation. Strikingly, a positive correlation was observed between active chromatin and steady-state transcription levels.\n\nConclusionTaken together, our results indicate that chromatin changes reflect the unusual gene expression regulation of trypanosomes and the differences among parasite developmental stages, even in the context of a lack of canonical transcriptional control of protein-coding genes.",

Droughts are more common and sometime floods are experienced in various parts of the country. Being a tropical country, the inter-annual climate variability in Ethiopia is dominated by ENSO (ElNino and Southern Oscillation).\\n\\nIn this study, an attempt has been made to determine the occurrence of droughts and floods on monthly basis, by calculating the monthly SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) using the available rainfall data during (1975-2005) at selected 26 stations that spread across the country. Based on the monthly SPI values computed, the droughts and floods of different intensities; extreme, severe and dry have been determined for all stations. The frequencies of the droughts and floods on monthly scale during the two rainy seasons, Belg (Feb-May) and Kiremt (Jun-Sep) seasons have been determined. For instance, during Belg season, there were 11 extreme (SPI < -2.0) droughts at Nazreth, 10 severe (SPI between -1.99 and -1.50) droughts at Diredawa and 14 moderate (SPI between -1.49 and -1.00) droughts at Kulumsa. Total number of droughts of all intensities over the study period is also highest (22) at Kulumsa and lowest (8) at Mekelle. Moreover, at Kulumsa both the numbers of droughts (22) and floods (22) during Belg are more, which shows that the rainfall variability is the highest at this station.\\n\\nThe association of the hydrological extremes during the two rainy seasons, belg and kiremt with the ENSO phases has also been examined, which forms a basis for the prediction of the occurrence of droughts (dry conditions) and floods (wet conditions) at individual stations using ENSO phases.",

This computation is greatly complicated by observer motion, which causes most objects to move across the retinal image. How the visual system detects scene-relative object motion during self-motion is poorly understood. Human behavioral studies suggest that the visual system may identify local conflicts between motion parallax and binocular disparity cues to depth, and may use these signals to detect moving objects. We describe a novel mechanism for performing this computation based on neurons in macaque area MT with incongruent depth tuning for binocular disparity and motion parallax cues. Neurons with incongruent tuning respond selectively to scene-relative object motion and their responses are predictive of perceptual decisions when animals are trained to detect a moving object during self-motion. This finding establishes a novel functional role for neurons with incongruent tuning for multiple depth cues.",

Therefore, rapid development of vaccines against prevalent variants including Omicron is urgently needed for COVID-19 prevention. Here, we designed a self-assembling ferritin-based nanoparticle (FNP) vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. The purified Fc-RBDOmicron automatically formed a dimer depending on the nature of the Fc tag, thus assembling onto the nanoparticles by the Fc-protein A tag interaction (FNP-Fc-RBDOmicron). The results of hACE2-transgenic mice immunization showed that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron RBD-specific IgG titer induced by FNP-Fc-RBDOmicron was much higher than that by Fc-RBDOmicron. Consistently, the sera showed a higher neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 in the FNP-Fc-RBDOmicron immunized mice, indicating that immunization of a self-assembling ferritin-based nanoparticle vaccine offers a robust humoral immune response against Omicron variants. This study offers a great potential for the quick response of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and affords versatility to develop universal vaccines against other emerging and reemerging coronaviruses in the future.",

In experimentally defined adhesomes, we noticed that there is clear enrichment of proteins that localise to the nucleus, and conversely, we now report that nuclear proteomes contain a class of adhesome components that localise to the nucleus. We here defined a nucleo-adhesome, providing experimental evidence for a remarkable scale of nuclear localisation of adhesion proteins, establishing a framework for interrogating nuclear adhesion protein functions. In adding to nuclear FAKs known roles in regulating transcription, we now show that nuclear FAK regulates expression of many adhesion-related proteins that localise to the nucleus and that nuclear FAK binds to the adhesome component and nuclear protein Hic-5. FAK and Hic-C work together in the nucleus, co-regulating a subset of genes transcriptionally. We describe the first nucleo-adhesome using a squamous cancer cell model, and demonstrate the new principle that there are nuclear adhesion protein subcomplexes that cooperate to control transcription.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/458428v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c841ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@586a75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b54439org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@921537_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Recent evidence suggests that the androgen receptor (AR) can promote tumor progression in DSRCTs. However, the mechanism of AR-induced oncogenic stimulation remains undetermined. Herein, we demonstrate that enzalutamide and AR-directed antisense oligonucleotides (AR-ASO) block 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced DSRCT cell proliferation and reduce xenograft tumor burden. Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were performed to elucidate how AR signaling regulates cellular epigenetic programs. Remarkably, ChIP-seq revealed novel DSRCT-specific AR DNA binding sites adjacent to key oncogenic regulators, including WT1 (the C-terminal partner of the pathognomonic fusion protein) and FOXF1. Additionally, AR occupied enhancer sites that regulate the Wnt pathway, neural differentiation, and embryonic organ development, implicating AR in dysfunctional cell lineage commitment. Our findings have immediate clinical implications given the widespread availability of FDA-approved androgen-targeted agents used for prostate cancer.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYWe demonstrate that DSRCT, an aggressive pediatric cancer, is an AR-driven malignancy capable of responding to androgen deprivation therapy.",

For example, melanoma cells with high expression of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5B (JARID1B) rest in a slow-cycling, yet reversible persister state. Over time, KDM5Bhigh cells can promote rapid tumor repopulation with equilibrated KDM5B expression heterogeneity. The cellular identity of KDM5Bhigh persister cells has not been studied so far, missing an important cell state-directed treatment opportunity in melanoma. Here, we have established a doxycycline-titratable system for genetic induction of permanent intratumor expression of KDM5B and screened for chemical agents that phenocopy this effect. Transcriptional profiling and cell functional assays confirmed that the dihydropyridine phenoxyethyl 4-(2-fluorophenyl)-2,7,7-trimethyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexa-hydro-quinoline-3-carboxylate (termed Cpd1) supports high KDM5B expression and directs melanoma cells towards differentiation along the melanocytic lineage and to cell cycle-arrest. The high KDM5B state additionally prevents cell proliferation through negative regulation of cytokinetic abscission. Moreover, treatment with Cpd1 promoted the expression of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase gene specifically sensitizing melanoma cells for the tyrosinase-processed antifolate prodrug 3-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(-)-epicatechin (TMECG). In summary, our study provides proof-of-concept for a new dual hit strategy in melanoma, in which persister state-directed transitioning limits tumor growth and plasticity and primes melanoma cells towards lineage-specific elimination.",

Pharmacological chaperones that stabilize the inherited Rho variants by assisting their folding and membrane targeting could slow the progression of RP. In this study, we employed virtual screening of synthetic compounds with natural product scaffold in conjunction with in vitro and in vivo evaluations to discover a novel chromenone-containing small molecule with favorable pharmacological properties that stabilizes rod opsin. This compound reversibly binds to unliganded bovine rod opsin with an EC50 value comparable to the 9-cis-retinal chromophore analog and partially rescued membrane trafficking of multiple RP-related rod opsin variants in vitro.

    "preprint_abstract": "Plants age by transition through distinct developmental phases, with the juvenile- to adult vegetative and the adult vegetative to reproductive phase change as two consecutive important post-embryonic phase transitions. During the transition from the juvenile- to adult vegetative phase, also known as the vegetative phase change (VPC), many plants undergo specific morphological and physiological changes. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), for example, the VPC is marked by clear heteroblastic changes in leaf shape and size and the appearance of trichomes on the abaxial side of leaves. The VPC and the vegetative to reproductive transition are promoted by the SQUAMOSA PROMOTOR BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) family of transcription factors and repressed by miR156 and miR157 that target the SPL transcripts. Here we present data that the plant longevity promoting AT-HOOK MOTIF NUCLEAR LOCALIZED protein 15 (AHL15) and family members also repress the SPL-driven ageing pathway. Arabidopsis ahl loss-of-function mutants showed an accelerated VPC and flowering time, whereas AHL15 overexpression dramatically delayed the VPC and flowering time in both Arabidopsis and Nicotiana tabacum. Expression analysis and tissue-specific AHL15 overexpression revealed that AHL15 affects the VPC and flowering time directly through its expression in the shoot apical meristem and young leaves. In addition, we found evidence that AHL15 represses SPL gene expression in a miR156/157-independent manner. The juvenile traits of spl loss-of-function mutants appeared to be dependent on the enhanced expression of the AHL15 gene, providing evidence for a reciprocal negative feedback between AHL15 and SPL genes. Antagonistically to AHLs, SPLs promote axillary meristem (AM) maturation and thus prevent vegetative growth from these meristems by repressing AHL15 expression.

    "preprint_abstract": "Miniature microscopes have gained considerable traction for in vivo calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon in vivo calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (Miniscope Analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware. Minian has been validated to reliably and robustly extract calcium events across different brain regions and from different cell types. In practice, Minian provides an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results.",

While reward has been shown to invigorate performance, it also enhances learning and/or retention. Therefore, a mechanistic account of the effects of reward on motor behaviour is lacking. Here we tested the hypothesis that these distinct reward-based improvements are driven by dissociable reward types: explicit reward (i.e. money) and performance feedback (i.e. points). Experiment 1 showed that explicit reward instantaneously improved movement times (MT) using a novel sequential reaching task. In contrast, performance-based feedback led to learning-related improvements. Importantly, pairing both maximised MT performance gains and accelerated movement fusion. Fusion describes an optimisation process during which neighbouring sequential movements blend together to form singular actions. Results from experiment 2 served as a replication and showed that fusion led to enhanced performance speed whilst also improving movement efficiency through increased smoothness. Finally, experiment 3 showed that these improvements in performance persist for 24 hours even without reward availability. This highlights the dissociable impact of explicit reward and performance feedback, with their combination maximising performance gains and leading to stable improvements in the speed and efficiency of sequential actions.",

Indeed, human and macaques have similar hands and homologous neural circuits to mediate manual behavior. However, few studies have systematically and quantitatively compared the manual behaviors of the two species. Such comparison is critical for assessing the validity of using the macaque sensorimotor system as a model of its human counterpart. In this study, we systematically compared the prehensile behaviors of humans and rhesus macaques using an identical experimental setup. We found human and macaque prehension kinematics to be generally similar with a few subtle differences. While the structure of the preshaping postures is similar in humans and macaques, human postures are more object-specific and human joints are less intercorrelated. Conversely, monkeys demonstrate more stereotypical grasping behaviors that are common across all grasp conditions and more variability in their postures across repeated grasps of the same object. Despite these subtle differences in manual behavior between humans and monkeys, our results bolster the use of the macaque model to understand the neural mechanisms of manual dexterity in humans.\n\nNO_SCPLOWEWC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWANDC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWNEWSWORTHYC_SCPLOWMacaques have been a dominant animal model to study the neural mechanisms of human dexterity because they exhibit complex manual behavior.

    "preprint_abstract": "The larval stage of the helminthic cestode Echinococcus multilocularis can inflict tumor-like hepatic lesions that cause the parasitic disease alveolar echinococcosis in humans, with high mortality in untreated patients. Recently, opportunistic properties of the disease have been proposed based on the increased incidence in immunocompromised patients and mouse models, indicating that an appropriate adaptive immune response is required for the control of the disease. However, little is known about how the local hepatic immune responses modulate the infection with E. multilocularis. In a mouse model of oral infection that mimics the normal infection route in human patients, the adaptive immune response in the liver was assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing of isolated hepatic CD3+ T cells at different infection stages. We observed an early significant increase in regulatory T and natural killer T cells in parallel with an active downregulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Early interactions between regulatory T cells and natural killer T cells indicate a promotion of the formation of hepatic lesions and later contribute to suppression of the resolution of parasite-induced pathology. The obtained data provides a fresh insight on the adaptive immune responses and local regulatory pathways at different infection stages of E. multilocularis in mice.\n\nAuthor summaryAlveolar echinococcosis is an endemic parasitic infection leading to slowly growing but potentially lethal liver lesions if untreated. Transmission by increasing populations of urban foxes and the raise of immunosuppressed patients in mainly industrializsed endemic zones are the main causes responsible for increased incidence of alveolar echinococcosis. Observations in humans and mice indicate that reactions of the adaptive immune system are required to control the disease and to protect from a chronic infection. Therefore, we analysed the responses of T cells in the liver at single-cell resolution in a murine model mimicking the typical route of infection in humans. This so called single-cell RNA sequencing revealed specific temporal changes of T cell subsets such as natural killer T cells and regulatory T cells, indicating that these two cell types are recruited in the early phase to try to protect from parasite proliferation and are subsequently inhibited in the late phase of infection thus indicating immune escape mechanisms of the parasite. This study shows temporal changes of the immune cell profile in the liver over the course of a natural infection with E. multilocularis at the single cell level and reveals putative targets for novel therapeutic approaches for human AE and possibly other (parasitic/helminthic) diseases.",

Due to the large number of possible evolutionary relationships between clones and the fundamental uncertainty of the mutational composition of subclones, elucidating the most probable evolutionary relationships poses statistical and computational challenges. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model called PICTograph to model uncertainty in the assignment of mutations to subclones and an approach to reduce the space of possible graphical models that postulate their evolutionary origin. Compared to available methods, our approach provided more consistent and accurate estimates of cancer cell fractions and better tree topology reconstruction over a range of simulated clonal diversity. Application of PICTograph to whole exome sequencing data of individuals with pancreatic cancer precursor lesions confirmed known early occurring mutations and indicated substantial molecular diversity, including multiple distinct subclones (range 6 - 12) and intra-sample mixing of subclones. As the complete evolutionary history for some patients was not identifiable, we used ensemble-based visualizations to distinguish between highly probable evolutionary relationships recovered in multiple models from uncertain relationships occurring in a small subset of models. These analyses indicate that PICTograph provides a useful approximation to evolutionary inference, particularly when the evolutionary course of a patients cancer is complex.",

However, the relation between intraventricular pressure separation and diverging aortic and pulmonary artery wall morphologies and mechanical characteristics is not understood. The snake cardiovascular system poses a unique model for the study of this question, since representatives both with and without intraventricular pressure separation exist. In this study we perform uniaxial tensile testing on vessel samples taken from the aortas and pulmonary arteries of the earth boa, Acrantophis madagascariensis, a species without intraventricular pressure separation. We then compare these morphological and mechanical characteristics with samples from the ball python, Python regius, and the yellow anaconda, Eunectes notaeus, species with and without intraventricular pressure separation, respectively. Strikingly, we find that although the aortas and pulmonary arteries of A. madagascariensis respond similarly to the same intramural blood pressures, they diverge strongly in morphology, and that this is a common attribute among species without intraventricular pressure separation in this study. In contrast, P. regius aortas and pulmonary arteries diverge both morphologically and in terms of their mechanical properties. Altogether our data indicate that intraventricular pressure separation does not explain diverging aortic and pulmonary artery morphologies. Following the Law of Laplace, we propose that thin pulmonary arteries represent a mechanism to protect the fragile pulmonary vascular bed by reducing the blood volume that passes through, to which genetic factors may contribute more strongly than physiological parameters.",

Synthesis is thus growth-coupled, and the stronger the coupling the more deleterious any impediments in synthesis are to cell growth, making high producer phenotypes evolutionarily robust. Additionally, we desire that these strains grow and synthesise at high rates. Genome-scale metabolic models can be used to explore and identify KOs that growth-couple synthesis, but these are rare in an immense design space, making the search difficult and slow.\n\nResultsTo address this multi-objective optimization problem, we developed a software tool named gcFront - using a genetic algorithm it explores KOs that maximise cell growth, product synthesis, and coupling strength. Moreover, our measure of coupling strength facilitates the search so that gcFront not only finds a growth coupled design in minutes but also outputs many alternative Pareto optimal designs from a single run - granting users flexibility in selecting designs to take to the lab.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationgcFront, with documentation and a workable tutorial, is freely available at GitHub: https://github.com/lLegon/gcFront, the repository of which is archived at Zenodo, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6338595 (Legon et al., 2022).\n\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary notes and data files are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Mice genetically deficient for dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase (Dbh-/-) lack the enzyme required to convert dopamine (DA) into norepinephrine (NE), resulting in globally undetectable NE and supranormal DA levels. Because catecholamines modulate novelty detection and reactivity, we investigated the effects of novel plant-derived odorants on repetitive behaviors in Dbh-/- mice and Dbh+/- littermate controls, which have catecholamine levels comparable to wild-type mice. Unlike Dbh+/- controls, which exhibited vigorous digging in response to novel odorants, Dbh-/- mice displayed excessive grooming. Drugs that block NE synthesis or neurotransmission suppressed odorant-induced digging in Dbh+/- mice, while a DA receptor antagonist attenuated grooming in Dbh-/- mice. The testing paradigm elicited high circulating levels of corticosterone regardless of Dbh genotype, indicating that NE is dispensable for this systemic stress response. Odorant exposure increased NE and DA abundance in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dbh+/- mice, while Dbh-/- animals lacked NE and had elevated PFC DA levels that were unaffected by novel smells. Together, these findings suggest that novel odorant-induced increases in central NE tone contribute to repetitive digging and reflect psychological stress, while central DA signaling contributes to repetitive grooming. Further, we have established a simple method for repeated assessment of stress-induced repetitive behaviors in mice, which may be relevant for modeling neuropsychiatric disorders like Tourette syndrome or obsessive-compulsive disorder that are characterized by stress-induced exacerbation of compulsive symptoms.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacterial cell division is a complex and highly regulated process requiring the coordination of many different proteins. Despite substantial work in model organisms, our understanding of the systems regulating cell division in non-canonical organisms, including critical human pathogens, is far from complete. One such organism is Staphylococcus aureus, a spherical bacterium that lacks known cell division regulatory proteins. Recent studies on GpsB, a protein conserved within the Firmicutes phylum, have provided insight into cell division regulation in S. aureus and other related organisms. It has been revealed that GpsB coordinates cell division and cell wall synthesis in multiple species by interacting with Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) and other partners. In S. aureus, we have previously shown that GpsB directly regulates FtsZ polymerization. In this study, using Bacillus subtilis as a tool, we isolated intragenic and extragenic spontaneous suppressor mutants that abrogate the lethality of S. aureus GpsB overproduction in B. subtilis. Through characterization of these mutants, we identified several key residues important for the function of GpsB. Furthermore, we discovered an additional role for GpsB in wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis in S. aureus. Specifically, we show that GpsB directly interacts with the wall teichoic acid export protein TarG using a bacterial two-hybrid analysis. We also identified a three-residue motif in GpsB that is crucial for this interaction. Based on the analysis of the localization of TagG in B. subtilis and its homolog TarG in S. aureus, it appears that WTA machinery is a part of the divisome complex. As such, we show additional evidence to the growing body of work that suggests that along with peptidoglycan synthesis, WTA biosynthesis and export may take place at the site of cell division. Taken together, this research illustrates how GpsB performs an essential function in S. aureus by directly linking the tightly regulated cell cycle processes of cell division and WTA-mediated cell surface decoration.\n\nIMPORTANCE/AUTHOR SUMMARYCytokinesis in bacteria involves an intricate orchestration of several key cell division proteins and other factors involved in building a robust cell envelope. One of the key factors that differentiates Gram-positive bacteria from Gram-negative bacteria is the presence of teichoic acids interlaced within the Gram-positive cell wall. By characterizing the role of Staphylococcus aureus GpsB, an essential cell division protein in this organism, we have uncovered an additional role for GpsB in wall teichoic acids (WTA) biosynthesis. We show that GpsB directly interacts with TarG of the WTA export complex. We also show this function of GpsB may be conserved in other GpsB homologs as GpsB and the WTA exporter complex follow similar localization patterns. It has been suggested that WTA acts as a molecular signal to control the activity of autolytic enzymes, especially during the separation of conjoined daughter cells. Thus, our results reveal that GpsB, in addition to playing a role in cell division, may also help coordinate WTA biogenesis.",

ATM activates a cascade of downstream effector proteins to regulate DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA double-strand breaks. While ATM is predominantly known for its role in DNA damage response and repair, new roles of ATM have recently begun to emerge, such as in regulating oxidative stress or metabolic pathways. Here, we report the surprising discovery that ATM inhibition and deletion lead to reduced expression of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A. Lamins are nuclear intermediate filaments that modulate nuclear shape, structure, and stiffness. Accordingly, inhibition or deletion of ATM resulted in increased nuclear deformability and enhanced cell migration through confined spaces, which requires substantial nuclear deformation. These findings point to a novel connection between ATM and lamin A and may have broad implications for cells with ATM mutations--as found in patients suffering from Ataxia Telangiectasia and many human cancers--which could lead to enhanced cell migration and increased metastatic potential.",

Nanoscale colocalization was assessed by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between NKG2D-GFP and Ly49A-RFP and measured for each synapse. In the presence of their respective cognate ligands, NKG2D and Ly49A colocalize at a nanometer scale leading to NK cell inhibition. However, increasing the size of the Ly49A ligand reduced the nanoscale colocalization with NKG2D consequently impairing Ly49A-mediated inhibition. Thus, our data shows NK cell signal integration is critically dependent on the dimensions of NK cell ligand-receptor pairs by affecting their relative nanometer-scale colocalization at the IS. Together, our results suggest the balance of NK cell signals, and NK cell responses, are determined by the relative nanoscale colocalization of activating and inhibitory receptors in the immune synapse.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Restoration of the p53 tumor suppressor for personalised cancer therapy is a promising strategy. However, high-affinity MDM2 inhibitors have shown substantial side effects in clinical trials. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of action of p53 reactivating molecules with alternative functional principle is of the utmost importance.\n\nHere, we report a discovery of a novel allosteric mechanism of p53 reactivation through targeting the p53 N-terminus which blocks both p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions. Using biochemical assays and molecular docking, we identified the binding site of two p53 reactivating molecules, RITA and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Ion-mobility mass spectrometry revealed that the binding of RITA to serine 33 and serine 37 is responsible for inducing the allosteric shift in p53, which shields the MDM2 binding residues of p53 and prevents its interactions with MDM2 and MDM4. Our results point to an alternative mechanism of blocking p53 interaction with MDM2 and MDM4 and may pave the way for the development of novel allosteric inhibitors of p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions.\n\nContribution to the fieldGiven the immense importance of the p53 tumor suppressor for cancer, efforts have been made to identify p53 activators, which sterically inhibit MDM2. Because high-affinity MDM2 inhibitors are facing problems with considerable side effects, other approaches are needed to reactivate p53 for improved cancer therapy. The allosteric mechanism of action of p53 activator RITA, which we discovered, and its dependence on the oncogenic switch, is an unexpected turn in the p53 story. Our findings provide a basis for the development of p53 activators with a similar mode of functioning, either through the classical drug discovery route or through the drug repurposing approach. Allosteric modulators might have great potential as single agents, or in combination with the standard of care. Further, p53 modulators could serve as invaluable tools to better understand its biology.",

The paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is a central hub that, by integrating sensory, metabolic and emotional states, may contribute to the regulation of feeding and homeostatic/allostatic processes. However, the underlying PVT circuits remain still elusive. Here, we aimed at unraveling the role of catecholaminergic (CA) inputs to the PVT in scaling feeding and metabolic efficiency. First, using region-specific retrograde disruption of CA projections, we show that PVT CA inputs mainly arise from the hindbrain, notably the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Second, taking advantage of integrative calorimetric measurements of metabolic efficiency, we reveal that CA inputs to the PVT scale adaptive feeding and metabolic responses in environmental, behavioral, physiological and metabolic stress-like contexts.

Further genomic analysis including average nucleotide identity (ANI) and detection of mobile genetic elements and genes of interest (e.g., virulence-associated) were conducted. The strains showed 98.7-98.8% ANI with the type strain. The UTK C1-0015 genome contained a partial monocin locus and a plasmid while the UTK C1-0024 genome contained a full monocin locus and a prophage. Phenotypic characterization consistent with those performed on the proposed type strain was conducted to assess consistency of phenotypes across a greater diversity of the proposed species (n=3 instead of n=1). Only a few findings were notably different from those of the type strain, such as catalase activity, glycerol metabolism, starch metabolism, and growth at 41{degrees}C.

The binding of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex (DCC) exclusively to the male X chromosome provides insight into binding site selectivity rules. Previous studies showed that the male-specific organizer of the complex, MSL2, and ubiquitous DNA-binding protein CLAMP directly interact and play an important role in the specificity of X chromosome binding. Here we studied the highly specific interaction between the intrinsically disordered region of MSL2 and the N-terminal zinc-finger C2H2-type (C2H2) domain of CLAMP. We obtained the NMR structure of the CLAMP N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger, which has a classic C2H2 zinc-finger fold with a rather unusual distribution of residues typically used in DNA recognition. Substitutions of residues in this C2H2 domain had the same effect on the viability of males and females, suggesting that it plays a general role in CLAMP activity. The N-terminal C2H2 domain of CLAMP is highly conserved in insects. However, the MSL2 region involved in the interaction is conserved only within the Drosophila genus, suggesting that this interaction emerged during the evolution of a mechanism for the specific recruitment of the DCC on the male X chromosome in Drosophilidae.",

Alternative splicing from the laminin 3 gene produces a non-laminin but netrin-like protein, Laminin N terminus 31 (LaNt 31). LaNt 31 is widely expressed in intact tissue and is upregulated in epithelial cancers and during wound healing. In vitro functional studies have shown that LaNt 31 can influence numerous aspects of epithelial cell behaviour via modifying matrix organisation, suggesting a new model of laminin auto-regulation. However, the function of this protein has not been established beyond the epithelium and it has never been studied in vivo. Here, a mouse transgenic line was generated using the ubiquitin C promoter to drive inducible expression of LaNt 31. When expression was induced at embryonic day 15.5, LaNt 31 transgenic animals were not viable at birth, exhibiting localised regions of erythema. Numerous striking defects were apparent histologically, including extra-vascular erythrocytes in multiple tissues, kidney epithelial detachment, tubular dilation, interstitial bleeding, and thickening of tubule basement membranes, disruption of the epidermal basal cell layer and of the hair follicle outer root sheath, and ~50% reduction of cell numbers in the liver associated with depletion of hematopoietic erythrocytic foci. These findings demonstrate that LaNt 31 can influence tissue morphogenesis during development. More broadly, these data provide the first in vivo evidence to support an emerging model of laminin self-regulation and provide a valuable model for onward investigation into this important area.\n\nSummary StatementExpression during development of Laminin N-terminus 31, a netrin-like laminin splice isoform, caused defects indicating basement membrane disruption in multiple tissues; providing the first in vivo evidence for laminin self-regulation.",

In vitro research presents the early step of basic science and drug development projects. Insufficient methodological reporting is likely to be one of the contributors to results heterogeneity, however, little knowledge on reporting habits of in vitro cancer research and their effects on results reproducibility is available. Glioblastoma is a form of brain cancer with largely unmet clinical need.\n\nMethodsHere we use systematic review to describe reporting practices in in vitro glioblastoma research using the U87-MG cell line and perform multilevel random-effects meta-analysis followed by meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity within that literature, and any associations between reporting characteristics and reported findings.\n\nResultsIn 137 identified articles, the overall methodological reporting is disappointing, e.g., the control type, mediums glucose level and cell density are reported in only 36.5, 21.2 and 16.8 percent of the articles, respectively. After adjustments for different drug concentrations and treatment durations, a three-level meta-analysis proves meaningful results heterogeneity across the studies (I2 = 70.1%).\n\nConclusionsOur results further support the ongoing efforts of establishing consensus reporting practices to elevate durability of results. By doing so, we hope that this work will raise awareness of how stricter reporting may help to improve the frequency of successful translation of preclinical results into human application, not only in neuro-oncology.\n\nFundingWe received no specific funding for this project.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The Locus coeruleus (LC) modulates various neuronal circuits throughout the brain. Its unique architectural organization encompasses a net of axonal innervation that spans the entire brain; while its somatic core is highly compact. Recent research revealed an unexpected cellular input specificity within the nucleus that can give rise to various network states that either broadcast norepinephrine signals throughout the brain or pointedly modulate specific brain areas. Such adaptive input-output functions likely surpass our existing network models that build upon a given synaptic wiring configuration between neurons. As the distances between noradrenergic neurons in the core of the LC are unusually small, neighboring neurons could theoretically impact each other via volume transmission of NE. We therefore set out to investigate if such interaction could be mediated through noradrenergic alpha2-receptors in a spiking neuron model of the LC. We validate our model of LC neurons through comparison with experimental patch-clamp data and identify key variables that impact alpha2-mediated inhibition of neighboring LC neurons. Our simulation confirms a reliable autoinhibition of LC neurons after episodes of high neuronal activity that continue even after neuronal activity subsided. Also, dendro-somatic synapses inhibit spontaneous spiking in the somatic compartment of connected neurons in our model. We determined the exact position of hundreds of LC neurons in the mouse brain stem via a tissue clearing approach and, based on this, further determined that 25 percent of noradrenergic neurons have a neighboring LC neuron within less than a 25-micrometer radius. By modeling NE diffusion, we estimate that more than 15 percent of alpha2-adrenergic receptors fraction can bind NE within such diffusion radius. Our spiking neuron model of LC neurons predicts that repeated or long-lasting episodes of high neuronal activity induce partitioning of the gross LC network, and reduces the spike rate in neighboring neurons at distances smaller than 25 micrometers.\n\nAs these volume-mediate neighboring effects are challenging to test with the current methodology, our findings can guide future experimental approaches to test this phenomenon and its physiological consequences.",

The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG-LPS) on cardiac function in mice, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Mice (C57BL/6) were injected with PG-LPS (0.8 mg/kg/day) with or without an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (TAK-242, 0.8 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Left ventricular ejection function was significantly decreased at 1 week (from 67 {+/-} 0.5 to 58 {+/-} 1.2 %) and remained low at 4 weeks (57 {+/-} 1.0 %). The number of apoptotic myocytes was increased (approximately 7.4-fold), the area of fibrosis was increased (approximately 3.3-fold) and the number of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive myocytes, a sensitive indicator of oxidative DNA damage, was increased (approximately 7.6-fold) at 4 weeks in the heart of PG-LPS treated mice. However, levels of various serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in PG-LPS-treated mice were similar to those in control mice. The impairment of cardiac function in PG-LPS-treated mice appears to involve activation of TLR4-NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4 signaling, leading to abundant production of reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ leakage from sarcoplastic reticulumn induced by calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban (at Thr-17) and ryanodine receptor 2 (at Ser-2448). Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 with TAK-242 attenuated the changes in cardiac function in PG-LPS-treated mice. Our results indicate that TLR4-NOX4 signaling may be a new therapeutic target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases in patients with periodontitis.",

While short reads are highly accurate, they are unable to span multiple exons.

Here we present a new release of StringTie that performs hybrid-read assembly. By taking advantage of the strengths of both long and short reads, hybrid-read assembly with StringTie is more accurate than long-read only or short-read only assembly, and on some datasets it can more than double the number of correctly assembled transcripts, while obtaining substantially higher precision than the long-read data assembly alone. Here we demonstrate the improved accuracy on simulated data and real data from Arabidopsis thaliana, Mus musculus, and human. We also show that hybrid-read assembly is more accurate than correcting long reads prior to assembly while also being substantially faster.

Cell stimulation induced nuclear foci formation of RelA and gene expression in a switch-like manner.

These properties were correlated with the number of gained cis-regulatory interactions, while switch-like gene induction was associated with the number of NF-{kappa}B binding sites in SE.

Researchers are developing new genetic and conventional vector control strategies to attempt to limit its burden. Novel control strategies require detailed safety assessment to ensure responsible and successful deployments. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles coluzzii, two closely related subspecies within the species complex Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), are among the dominant malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. These two subspecies readily hybridise and compete in the wild and are also known to have distinct niches, each with spatially and temporally varying carrying capacities driven by precipitation and land use factors.\n\nWe model the spread and persistence of a population-modifying gene drive system in these subspecies across sub-Saharan Africa by simulating introductions of genetically modified mosquitoes across the African mainland and its offshore islands. We explore transmission of the gene drive between the two subspecies that arise from different hybridisation mechanisms, the effects of both local dispersal and potential wind-aided migration to the spread, and the development of resistance to the gene drive. Given the best current available knowledge on the subspecies life histories, we find that an introduced gene drive system with typical characteristics can plausibly spread from even distant offshore islands to the African mainland with the aid of wind-driven migration, with resistance taking over within a decade. Our model accounts for regional to continental scale mechanisms, and demonstrates a range of realistic dynamics including the effect of prevailing wind on spread and spatio-temporally varying carrying capacities for subspecies. As a result, it is well-placed to answer future questions relating to mosquito gene drives as important life history parameters become better understood.",

    "preprint_abstract": "How neuronal variability impacts neuronal codes is a central question in systems neuroscience, often with complex and model dependent answers. Most population models are parametric, with a tacitly assumed structure of neuronal tuning and population-wide variability. While these models provide key insights, they purposely divorce any mechanistic relationship between trial average and trial variable neuronal activity. By contrast, circuit based models produce activity with response statistics that are reflection of the underlying circuit structure, and thus any relations between trial averaged and trial variable activity are emergent rather than assumed. In this work, we study information transfer in networks of spatially ordered spiking neuron models with strong excitatory and inhibitory interactions, capable of producing rich population-wide neuronal variability. Motivated by work in the visual system we embed a columnar stimulus orientation map in the network and measure the population estimation of an orientated input. We show that the spatial structure of feedforward and recurrent connectivity are critical determinants for population code performance. In particular, when network wiring supports stable firing rate activity then with a sufficiently large number of decoded neurons all available stimulus information is transmitted. However, if the inhibitory projections place network activity in a pattern forming regime then the population-wide dynamics compromise information flow. In total, network connectivity determines both the stimulus tuning as well as internally generated population-wide fluctuations and thereby dictates population code performance in complicated ways where modeling efforts provide essential understanding.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bacterial signal transduction systems sense changes in the environment and transmit these signals to control cellular responses. The simplest one-component signal transduction systems include an input sensor domain and an output response domain encoded in a single protein chain. Alternately, two-component signal transduction systems transmit signals by phosphorelay between input and output domains from separate proteins. The membrane tethered periplasmic bile acid sensor that activates the Vibrio parahaemolyticus type III secretion system adopts an obligate heterodimer of two proteins encoded by partially overlapping VtrA and VtrC genes. This co-component signal transduction system binds bile acid using a lipocalin-like domain in VtrC and transmits the signal through the membrane to a cytoplasmic DNA-binding transcription factor in VtrA. Using the domain and operon organization of VtrA/VtrC, we identify a fast-evolving superfamily of co-component systems in enteric bacteria. Accurate machine learning-based fold predictions for the candidate co-components support their homology in the twilight zone of rapidly evolving sequence and provide mechanistic hypotheses about previously unrecognized lipid-sensing functions.\n\nSignificance statementUsing the domain and operon organization of VtrA/VtrC, combined with fold predictions, we identify new co-component signal transduction systems in enteric bacteria that likely regulate virulence. We observe that the heterodimeric VtrA/VtrC periplasmic bile acid receptor controlling Vibrio parahaemolyticus T3SS2 is a distant homolog of the ToxR/ToxS master regulator of virulence and has evolved beyond confident sequence recognition. Exploiting the newly developed machine learning methods for structure prediction, we observe a VtrC-like lipocalin fold for both the ToxS periplasmic domain and for other detected periplasmic sensor components. This structure prediction supports the divergent evolution of VtrA/VtrC-like co-component signal transduction systems and suggests a role for lipid sensing in regulating virulence in enteric bacteria.",

However, deciphering the role of their counterbalanced oxidative signals is challenging due to monitoring difficulties. Here, we demonstrate the light-depended redox modification of chloroplast-targeted 2-Cys peroxiredoxins and introduce peroxiredoxin-based biosensors to monitor photosynthetically-derived oxidative signals. By employing a set of genetically encoded biosensors, we show the induction of oxidative signals under habitual light intensities and their inverse relationship with NADPH levels, unraveling the combined activity of reducing and oxidizing signals in fine-tuning chloroplast metabolism. A faster increase in carbon assimilation rates during photosynthesis induction phase was measured in plants deficient in 2-Cys peroxiredoxins compared to wild-type, suggesting the involvement of oxidative signals in attenuating photosynthesis under variable light environments. We suggest that oxidative signals measured by peroxiredoxin-based biosensors reflect the limitation to photosynthesis imposed by the redox regulatory system.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA genetically encoded biosensor unmasked the dominant role of photosynthetically-derived oxidative signals under habitual conditions.",

For antiviral therapeutics, drug repurposing allowed for rapid movement of existing clinical candidates and therapies into human clinical trials to be tested as COVID-19 therapies. One effective antiviral treatment strategy used early in symptom onset is to prevent viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 enters ACE2-expressing cells when the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 followed by cleavage at two cut sites on the spike protein. TMPRSS2 has a protease domain capable of cleaving the two cut sites; therefore, a molecule capable of inhibiting the protease activity of TMPRSS2 could be a valuable antiviral therapy. Initially, we used a fluorogenic high-throughput screening assay for the biochemical screening of 6030 compounds in NCATS annotated libraries. Then, we developed an orthogonal biochemical assay that uses mass spectrometry detection of product formation to ensure that hits from the primary screen are not assay artifacts from the fluorescent detection of product formation. Finally, we assessed the hits from the biochemical screening in a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entry assay. Of the six molecules advanced for further studies, two are approved drugs in Japan (camostat and nafamostat), two have entered clinical trials (PCI-27483 and otamixaban), while the other two molecules are peptidomimetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 taken from the literature that have not advanced into clinical trials (compounds 92 and 114). This work demonstrates a suite of assays for the discovery and development of new inhibitors of TMPRSS2.",

To advance preclinical therapeutic development for gliomas, there is an urgent need for predictive in vitro models with realistic blood-brain barrier vasculature. Here, we report a vascularized human glioblastoma (GBM) model in a microfluidic device that accurately recapitulates brain tumor vasculature with self-assembled endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes to investigate the transport of targeted nanotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier and into GBM cells. Using modular layer-by-layer assembly, we functionalized the surface of nanoparticles with GBM-targeting motifs to improve trafficking to tumors. We directly compared nanoparticle transport in our in vitro platform with transport across mouse brain capillaries using intravital imaging, validating the ability of the platform to model in vivo blood-brain barrier transport. We investigated the therapeutic potential of functionalized nanoparticles by encapsulating cisplatin and showed improved efficacy of these GBM-targeted nanoparticles both in vitro and in an in vivo orthotopic xenograft model. Our vascularized GBM model represents a significant biomaterials advance, enabling in-depth investigation of brain tumor vasculature and accelerating the development of targeted nanotherapeutics.\n\nSignificance StatementThe blood-brain barrier represents a major therapeutic challenge for the treatment of glioblastoma, and there is an unmet need for in vitro models that recapitulate human biology and are predictive of in vivo response. Here we present a new microfluidic model of vascularized glioblastoma featuring a tumor spheroid in direct contact with self-assembled vascular networks comprised of human endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes. This model was designed to accelerate the development of targeted nanotherapeutics, and enabled rigorous assessment of a panel of surface-functionalized nanoparticles designed to exploit a receptor overexpressed in tumor-associated vasculature. Trafficking and efficacy data in the in vitro model compared favorably to parallel in vivo data, highlighting the utility of the vascularized glioblastoma model for therapeutic development.",

In this report, we experimentally tested two iLOV mutants, iLOVL470T/Q489K and iLOVV392K/F410V/A426S, which were previously computationally proposed by Khrenova et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b07533) to have red-shifted excitation and emission spectra. We found that mutants bearing the V392K mutation lost the ability to bind FMN. While iLOVL470T/Q489K is about 20% brighter compared to WT iLOV in vitro, it exhibits a blue shift in contrast to QM/MM predictions. Additionally, both mutants are expressed at low levels and have undetectable fluorescence in living cells, which prevents their utilization in imaging applications. Our results suggest that rational fluorescent protein design efforts can benefit from in silico protein stability and ligand affinity calculations.",

Because of the large cell size (approximately 100 m in diameter) of bacteriocytes and their pivotal role in nutritional symbiosis, researchers have considered that these cells are highly polyploid and assumed that bacteriocyte polyploidy may be essential for the symbiotic relationship between the aphid and the bacterium. However, little is known about the ploidy levels and dynamics of aphid bacteriocytes. Here, we quantitatively analyzed the ploidy levels in the bacteriocytes of the pea-aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Image-based fluorometry revealed the hyper polyploidy of the bacteriocytes ranging from 16- to 256-ploidy throughout the lifecycle. Bacteriocytes of adult parthenogenetic viviparous females were mainly 64-128C DNA levels, while those of sexual morphs (oviparous females and males) were consisted of 64C, and 32-64C cells, respectively. During post-embryonic development of viviparous females, the ploidy level of bacteriocytes increased substantially, from 16-32C at birth to 128-256C in actively reproducing adults. These results suggest that the ploidy levels are dynamically regulated among phenotypes and during development. Our comprehensive and quantitative data provides a foundation for future studies to understand the functional roles and biological significance of the polyploidy of insect bacteriocytes.",

In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates recovered from river water to fully characterize the genetic contexts of blaCTX-M genes. Among the 14 isolates with completed genomes, blaCTX-M genes were detected on the chromosome in nine isolates. All but one chromosomal blaCTX-M genes were associated with ISEcp1 and were carried on different transposition units ranging in size from 2,855 bp to 11,093 bp; the exception, blaCTX-M-2, was associated with ISCR1. The remaining five isolates carried blaCTX-M genes on epidemic IncI1 plasmids of different sequence types (STs) (ST3, ST16, ST113, and ST167) (n = 4) or on an IncB/O/K/Z plasmid (n = 1). This study revealed that environmental E. coli carry blaCTX-M genes in diverse genetic contexts. Apparent high prevalence of chromosomal blaCTX-M potentially indicates that some E. coli can stably maintain blaCTX-M genes in environmental waters, though further studies are needed to confirm this.",

Overall, substitutions in N-benzyl fragment primarily affected zebrafish locomotion, and in phenethylamine moiety - anxiety-like behavior, also modulating brain serotonin and/or dopamine turnover. We also identified several behavioral clusters, including anxiogenic/hypolocomotor (24H-NBF, 24H-NBOMe and 34H-NBF), behaviorally inert (34H-NBBr, 34H-NBCl and 34H- NBOMe), anxiogenic/hallucinogenic-like (24H-NBBr, 24H-NBCl and 24H-NBOMe(F)), and anxiolytic/hallucinogenic-like (34H-NBOMe(F)) agents. The 24H-NBOMe(F) and 34H-NBOMe(F) also reduced despair-like behavior in zebrafish. The artificial intelligence-driven phenotyping supports association of multiple compounds with NMDA antagonists and/or MDMA, supporting their potential hallucinogenic-like properties, as well as other valuable psychoactive effects. In silico functional molecular activity modelling also supports existing of similarities between studied NBPEAs drugs, MDMA, and ketamine. Functional analysis implicates potential involvement of serotonin release stimulating activity, calcium channel (voltage-sensitive) activity, some serotonin receptors activity and variety of psychiatric and neurologic disorders treatments activities.

Finally, we used guilt-by-association techniques to further classify these lincRNAs according to putative function.

    "preprint_abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of pyramidal cell connections are among the key mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the brain. Despite their important role, only a few of these connections have been characterized in terms of LTP/LTD dynamics, such as the one between layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells (L5-TTPCs). Comparing the available evidence on different pyramidal connection types reveals a large variability of experimental outcomes, possibly indicating the presence of connection-type-specific mechanisms. Here, we show that a calcium-based plasticity rule regulating L5-TTPC synapses holds also for several other pyramidal-to-pyramidal connections in a digital model of neocortical tissue. In particular, we show that synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns jointly determine LTP/LTD dynamics without requiring a different model or parameter set for each connection type. We therefore propose that a similar set of plasticity mechanisms is shared by seemingly very different neocortical connections and that only a small number of targeted experiments is required for generating a complete map of synaptic plasticity dynamics in the neocortex.",

Within the last few years, a burst of research has led to the discovery of novel prokaryotic RTs with diverse antiviral properties, such as DRTs (Defense-associated RTs), which belong to the so-called group of unknown RTs (UG) and are closely related to the Abortive Infection system (Abi) RTs. In this work, we performed a systematic analysis of UG and Abi RTs, increasing the number of UG/Abi members up to 42 highly diverse groups, most of which are predicted to be functionally associated with other gene(s) or domain(s). Based on this information, we classified these systems into three major classes. In addition, we reveal that most of these groups are associated with defense functions and/or mobile genetic elements, and demonstrate the antiphage role of four novel groups. Besides, we highlight the presence of one of these systems in novel families of human gut viruses infecting members of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla. This work lays the foundation for a comprehensive and unified understanding of these highly diverse RTs with enormous biotechnological potential.",

Evidence for their effects on cognitive decline is, however, less clear.\n\nMETHODSThe sample consists of 5,324 participants in the Whitehall II Study, 8,572 in the Health and Retirement Study, and 1,413 in the Kame Project, who completed self-report questionnaires on their early-life experiences and underwent repeated cognitive assessments. We characterised cognitive trajectories using latent class mixed models, and explored associations between childhood SES and latent class membership using logistic regressions.\n\nRESULTSWe identified distinct trajectories classes for all cognitive measures examined. Childhood socioeconomic deprivation was associated with an increased likelihood of being in a lower trajectory class.\n\nDISCUSSIONOur findings support the notions that cognitive ageing is a heterogeneous process and early-life circumstances may have lasting effects on cognition across the life-course.\n\nResearch in contextO_LISystematic review: We reviewed the literature on childhood socioeconomic status (SES) as a predictor for cognitive decline in mid- to later-life using PubMed. Studies generally reported lower childhood SES is associated with poorer baseline cognition, but not a faster rate of decline. These studies generally focused on the mean rate of decline in the population; no study to date has explored associations between childhood SES and different cognitive trajectories. Relevant studies have been appropriately cited.\nC_LIO_LIInterpretation: Our findings suggest that cognitive trajectories differ between individuals and across cognitive domains. Individuals of lower childhood SES were more likely to be in a lower cognitive trajectory class, which may or may not involve more rapid decline.\nC_LIO_LIFuture directions: Future studies should include more cognitive outcomes and longer follow-ups, as well as investigate the impact of social mobility to further improve our understanding on how early-life circumstances influence cognitive decline.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOC) from biological samples have unknown origins. VOCs may originate from the host or different microbial organisms from a microbial community. In order to disentangle the origin of microbial VOCs, we performed volatile headspace analysis of bacterial mono- and co-cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, and stable isotope probing in biological samples of feces, saliva, sewage, and sputum. We utilized mono- and co-cultures to identify volatile production from individual bacterial species or in combination with stable isotope probing to identify the active metabolism of microbes from the biological samples. To extract the VOCs, we employed vacuum assisted sorbent extraction (VASE). VASE is an easy-to-use commercialized solvent-free headspace extraction method for semi-volatile and volatile compounds. The lack of solvents and the near vacuum conditions used make developing a method relatively easy and fast when compared to other extraction options like tert-butylation and solid phase microextraction. However, VASE does not work on nonvolatile compounds, thus excluding many protein analyses and heavy stable isotope labelling experiments. Using the workflow described here, we identified volatile signatures from mono- and co-cultures indicating there were volatiles specific to certain microbes or co-cultures. Furthermore, analysis of the stable isotope probing of biological samples identified VOCs that were either commonly or uniquely produced from the different human derived biological samples. Here we present the general workflow and experimental considerations of VASE.\n\nSUMMARYFrom this protocol, readers will be able to extract volatile organic compounds from a biological sample with the vacuum assisted sorbent extraction method, run samples on a GC-MS with the use of the Entech autosampler, and analyze data.",

Here we use a single molecule biophysical assay to overcome some of these challenges, enabling a detailed mechanistic dissection of a paradigmatic remodeler reaction, that of sliding a nucleosome towards the longer DNA linker. We focus on how two motors of a dimeric remodeler coordinate to accomplish such directional sliding. We find that ATP hydrolysis by both motors promotes coordination, suggesting a role for ATP in resolving the competition for directional commitment. Furthermore, we show an artificially constitutive dimer is no more or less coordinated, but is more processive, suggesting a cell could modulate a remodelers oligomeric state to modulate local chromatin dynamics.",

Models of gustatory coding propose that within modalities (e.g. sweet, bitter, etc.), taste ligands are not distinct stimuli. However, these models are based on data from mice or flies that have omnivorous, non-specialist diets. A specialist feeder might, however, be expected to have acuity within modality if stimulus resolution was critical to survival. Previously, we found that bumblebees have a specialized mechanism for sensing sugars whereby two gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) within the galeal sensilla of the bees mouthparts exhibit burst of spikes. Here, we show that the temporal firing patterns of these GRNs separate sugars into four distinct groups that correlate with sugar nutritional value and palatability. We also identified a third GRN that responded to stimulation with relatively high concentrations of fructose, sucrose, and maltose. Sugars that were non-metabolizable or toxic suppressed the responses of bursting GRNs to sucrose. These abilities to encode information about sugar value are a refinement to the bumblebees sense of sweet taste that could be an adaptation that enables precise calculations of the nature and nutritional value of floral nectar.",

They are determined, at least in part, by the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids and may be reflected in the protein three-dimensional structure. Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes is a critical step for understanding protein function and disease mechanism as well as enabling drug discovery. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments have been performed on SARS-CoV-2s spike receptor binding domain and the human ACE2 zinc-binding peptidase domain - both central players in viral infection and evolution and antibody evasion - quantifying how mutations impact binding affinity and protein expression. Here, we modeled biochemical phenotypes from massively parallel assays, using convolutional neural networks trained on protein sequence mutations in the virus and human host. We found that neural networks are significantly predictive of binding affinity, protein expression, and antibody escape, learning complex interactions and higher-order features that are difficult to capture with conventional methods from structural biology. Integrating the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids, including hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, and long-range non-bonded energy per atom, significantly improved prediction (empirical p<0.01) though there was such a strong dependence on the sequence data alone to yield reasonably good prediction. We observed concordance of the DMS data and our neural network predictions with an independent study on intermolecular interactions from molecular dynamics (multiple 500 ns or 1 s all-atom) simulations of the spike protein-ACE2 interface, with critical implications for the use of deep learning to dissect molecular mechanisms. The mutation- or genetically-determined component of a biochemical phenotype estimated from the neural networks has improved causal inference properties relative to the original phenotype and can facilitate crucial insights into disease pathophysiology and therapeutic design.",

We investigate the dynamic mechanisms underlying the interactions between rapidly fluctuating signals and the intrinsic properties of the target cells to produce variable and/or coherent responses. We use linearized and non-linear conductance-based models and piecewise constant (PWC) inputs with short duration pieces. The amplitude distributions of the constant pieces consist of arbitrary permutations of a baseline PWC function. In each trial within a given protocol we use one of these permutations and each protocol consists of a subset of all possible permutations, which is the only source of uncertainty in the protocol. We show that sustained oscillatory behavior can be generated in response to various forms of PWC inputs independently of whether the stable equilibria of the corresponding unperturbed systems are foci or nodes. The oscillatory voltage responses are amplified by the model nonlinearities and attenuated for conductance-based PWC inputs as compared to current-based PWC inputs, consistent with previous theoretical and experimental work. In addition, the voltage responses to PWC inputs exhibited variability across trials, which is reminiscent of the variability generated by stochastic noise (e.g., Gaussian white noise). Our analysis demonstrates that both oscillations and variability are the result of the interaction between the PWC input and the target cells autonomous transient dynamics with little to no contribution from the dynamics in vicinities of the steady-state, and do not require input stochasticity.",

Following advances in our understanding of the role of replication of S. pneumoniae within a specific subset of splenic macrophages, we sought to investigate events within the spleen that correlate with differential outcomes of invasive pneumococcal infection. Utilising murine invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) models, here we report that infection during the murine active phase (zeitgeber time; 15h after start of light cycle, 3h after start of dark cycle) resulted in significantly faster onset of moderate septicaemia compared to rest phase (zeitgeber time 3; 3h after start of light cycle) infection. These findings correlated with significantly higher pneumococcal burden within the spleen of active phase-infected mice at early time points compared to rest phase-infected mice. Whole-section confocal microscopy analysis of these spleens revealed that the number of pneumococci is significantly higher exclusively within marginal zone metallophilic macrophages (MMMs), known to allow intracellular pneumococcal replication as a prerequisite step to the onset of septicaemia. Pneumococcal clusters within MMMs were more abundant and increased in size in active phase-infected mice compared to those in rest phase-infected mice which decreased in size over time and were present in a lower percentage of MMMs. This phenomenon preceded significantly higher levels of bacteraemia alongside serum IL-6 and TNF- concentrations in active phase-infected mice following re-seeding of pneumococci into the blood. In summary, these data link the difference in susceptibility to invasive pneumococcal infection to variation in the ability of MMMs to successfully control and digest phagocytosed bacteria.\n\nAuthor summaryCircadian rhythms are present within the majority of multicellular organisms and influence almost all aspects of our physiology. As such, circadian rhythm disorders have been shown to result in an increased susceptibility to certain diseases. The effects of host circadian rhythm have been also mirrored in rodent studies, with the outcome of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection being dependent on the time of challenge. Whilst studies into the functional effects of circadian rhythm on the host immune system are present, knowledge of how these contribute to the control of invasive S. pneumoniae infection are lacking, especially considering the recent breakthrough in understanding the stages of pneumococcal pathogenesis. We show here that mice infected with S. pneumoniae during their active phase developed septicaemia quicker than those infected during their rest phase. We demonstrate that this is likely due to increased replication of pneumococci specifically within a subset of splenic macrophages, which subsequently results in increased numbers of pneumococci in the blood and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which result in septicaemia. These data provide novel insights into how circadian rhythm influences the immune functionality of the spleen, and how the regulation of function of one macrophage subtype can significantly alter the course of infection.",

To manipulate the cardiac cycle, the presentation of discriminative stimuli was timed to coincide with either cardiac systole or diastole. We fitted the participants choices in the task with reinforcement learning (RL) models and estimated parameters involving instrumental learning (i.e., learning rate and inverse temperature) separately in the systole and diastole trials. Model-based analysis revealed that the learning rate for positive prediction errors was higher than that for negative prediction errors in the systole trials; however, learning rates did not differ between positive and negative prediction errors in the diastole trials.

    "preprint_abstract": "Temperature compensation is a critical feature of circadian rhythms, but how it is achieved remains elusive. Here, we uncovered the important role played by the Drosophila PERIOD (PER) phosphodegron in temperature compensation. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we introduced a series of mutations that altered three Serines (S44, 45 and 47) belonging to the PER phosphodegron, the functional homolog of mammalian PER2s S487 phosphodegron, which impacts temperature compensation. While all three Serine to Alanine substitutions lengthened period at all temperatures tested, temperature compensation was differentially affected. S44A and S45A substitutions caused decreased temperature compensation, while S47A resulted in overcompensation. These results thus reveal unexpected functional heterogeneity of phosphodegron residues in thermal compensation. Furthermore, mutations impairing phosphorylation of the pers phosphocluster decreased thermal compensation, consistent with its inhibitory role on S47 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the S47A substitution caused increased accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated PER at warmer temperatures. This finding was corroborated by cell culture assays in which S47A resulted in excessive temperature compensation of phosphorylation-dependent PER degradation. Thus, we show a novel role of the PER phosphodegron in temperature compensation through temperature-dependent modulation of the abundance of hyper-phosphorylated PER. Our work also reveals interesting mechanistic convergences and differences between mammalian and Drosophila temperature compensation of the circadian clock.\n\nAuthor summaryCircadian rhythms are critical adaptive mechanisms that enable most organisms to adjust their physiology and behavior to the changes that occur in their environment every day. Ambient temperature varies constantly, but interestingly molecular circadian pacemakers do not accelerate with increasing temperature, while most biochemical reactions are sensitive to temperature. This phenomenon of circadian temperature compensation is poorly understood. Using genome editing and transgenic approaches, we found that two phosphorylated motifs in the Drosophila PERIOD protein, which regulate stability, impact temperature compensation. Moreover, we observed that mutation of a key Serine residue controlling PER degradation, S47, affects the accumulation of phosphorylated PER in a temperature-dependent manner, and causes PER degradation kinetics to become overly protected from increased temperature. As a result, the circadian clock of S47 mutant flies is excessively temperature-compensated. Our work thus reveals an interesting mechanism that controls temperature compensation in Drosophila. Moreover, comparison with mammals reveal interesting similarities, but also important differences in how temperature compensation of the circadian clock is achieved.",

Modern accounts assume a single global structure-function relationship that persists over time. Here we show that structure-function coupling is dynamic and regionally heterogeneous. We use a temporal unwrapping procedure to identify moment-to-moment co-fluctuations in neural activity, and reconstruct time-resolved structure-function coupling patterns. We find that patterns of dynamic structure-function coupling are highly organized across the cortex. These patterns reflect cortical hierarchies, with stable coupling in unimodal and transmodal cortex, and dynamic coupling in intermediate regions, particularly in insular cortex (salience network) and frontal eye fields (dorsal attention network). Finally, we show that the variability of structure-function coupling is shaped by the distribution of connection lengths. The time-varying coupling of structural and functional connectivity points towards an informative feature of the brain that may reflect how cognitive functions are flexibly deployed and implemented.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Misfolded protein conformations with decreased functionality can bypass the proteostasis machinery and remain soluble in vivo. This is an unexpected phenomenon as several cellular quality control mechanisms have evolved to rid cells of misfolded proteins. Three questions, then, are: how is it structurally possible for long-lived, soluble, misfolded proteins to bypass the proteostasis machinery and processes? How widespread are these soluble, misfolded states across the proteome? And how long do they persist for? Here, we address these questions using coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations of the synthesis, termination, and post-translational dynamics of a representative set of cytosolic E. coli proteins. We predict that half of all proteins exhibit subpopulations of misfolded conformations that are likely to bypass molecular chaperones, avoid aggregation, and not be rapidly degraded. These misfolded states may persist for months or longer for some proteins. Structurally characterizing these misfolded states, we observe they have a large amount of native structure, but also contain localized misfolded regions from non-native changes in entanglement, in which a protein segment threads through a loop formed by another portion of the protein that is not found in the native state. The surface properties of these misfolded states are native like, suggesting they may bypass the proteostasis machinery and its regulatory processes to remain soluble, while their entanglements make these states long-lived kinetic traps, as disentanglement requires unfolding of already folded portions of the protein. In terms of function, we predict that one-third of proteins have subpopulations that misfold into less-functional states that have structurally perturbed functional sites yet remain soluble. Data from limited-proteolysis mass spectrometry experiments, which interrogate the misfolded conformations populated by proteins upon unfolding and refolding, are consistent with the structural changes seen in the entangled states of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase upon misfolding. These results provide an explanation for how proteins can misfold into soluble conformations with reduced functionality that can bypass cellular quality controls, and indicate, unexpectedly, this may be a wide-spread phenomenon in proteomes. Such entanglements are observed in many native structures, suggesting the non-native entanglements we observe are plausible. More broadly, these near-native entangled structures suggest a hypothesis for how synonymous mutations can modulate downstream protein structure and function, with these mutations partitioning nascent proteins between these kinetically trapped states.",

Here, we further extend it to detect somatic mutations from RNA sequencing data without a matched-normal sample. This is accomplished via a machine learning approach that classifies mutations as either somatic or germline based on various features. When applied to RNA-sequencing of >450 melanoma samples high precision and recall are achieved, and both mutational signatures and driver genes are correctly identified. Finally, we show that RNA-based TMB is significantly associated with patient survival, with similar or superior performance to DNA-based TMB.

The preclinical use of engineered pathogens capable of constitutive light production may provide realtime information on microbial-specific metabolic processes. Here we mapped the central metabolism of a luxABCDE-modified S. pyogenes Xen20 (Strep. Xen20) to its de novo synthesis of luciferase substrates as assessed by the rate of light production in response to different environmental triggers. Previous characterization predicted that the lux operon was under the myo-inositol iolE promotor. Here we show that supplementation with myoinositol generated increased Xen20 luminescence. Surprisingly, when supplemented with infection-relevant carbon sources, such as glucose or glycine, light production was diminished. This was presumably due to the scavenging of pyruvate by L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Inhibition of LDH by its inhibitor, oxamate, partially restored luminescent signal in the presence of glucose, presumably by allowing the resulting pyruvate to proceed to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). This phenomenon appeared specific to the lactic acid bacterial metabolism as glucose or glycine did not reduce signal in an analogous luxABCDE-modified Gram-positive pathogen, Staph. Xen29. The Strep. Xen20 cells produced light in a concentration-dependent manner, inversely related to the amount of glucose present. Taken together, our measures of microbial response could provide new information regarding the responsiveness of S. pyogenes metabolism to acute changes in its local environments and cellular health.",

Most of these neurons are enwrapped by a specialized extracellular matrix structure (ECM) called perineuronal net (PNN), which can regulate their synaptic input. In this study, we investigated the relationship between PNNs, parvalbumin interneurons and synaptic distribution on these cells in the adult primary visual cortex (V1) of quadruple knockout mice deficient for the ECM molecules brevican, neurocan, tenascin-C and tenascin-R. We used super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to analyze PNN structure and associated synapses. Additionally, we examined parvalbumin and calretinin interneuron populations. We observed a reduction in the number of PNN-enwrapped cells and a clear disorganization of the PNN structure in the quadruple knockout V1. This was accompanied by an imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory synapses with a reduction of inhibitory and an increase of excitatory synaptic elements along the PNNs. Also, the number of parvalbumin interneurons was reduced in the quadruple knockout, while calretinin interneurons, which do not wear PNNs did not display differences in number. Interestingly, we found the transcription factor Otx2 homeoprotein positive cell population also reduced. Otx2 is crucial for parvalbumin and PNN maturation and a positive feedback loop between these parameters has been described. Collectively, these data indicate an important role of brevican, neurocan, tenascin-C and tenascin-R in regulating the interplay between PNNs, inhibitory interneurons, synaptic distribution as well as Otx2 in the V1.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Chitin is a biopolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with {beta}-1,4-bond and is the main component of arthropod exoskeletons and the cell walls of many fungi. Chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the {beta}-1,4-bond in chitin and degrades chitin into oligomers. It has been found in a wide range of organisms. Chitinase from Gazyumaru (Ficus microcarpa) latex exhibits antifungal activity by degrading chitin in the cell wall of fungi and is expected to be used in medical and agricultural fields. However, the enzymes thermostability is an important factor; chitinase is not thermostable enough to maintain its activity under the actual applicable conditions. We solved the crystal structure of chitinase to explore the target sites to improve its thermostability. Based on the crystal structure and sequence alignment among other chitinases, we rationally introduced proline residues, a disulfide bond, and salt bridge in the chitinase using protein engineering methods. As a result, we successfully constructed the thermostable mutant chitinases rationally with high antifungal and specific activities. The results provide a useful strategy to enhance the thermostability of this enzyme family.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe solved the crystal structure of the chitinase from Gazyumaru (Ficus microcarpa) latex exhibiting antifungal activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the thermostable mutant enzyme with a melting temperature (Tm) 6.9 {degrees}C higher than wild type (WT) and a half-life at 60{degrees}C that is 15 times longer than WT was constructed through 10 amino acid substitutions, including five proline residues substitutions, making disulfide bonding, and building a salt bridge network in the enzyme. These mutations do not affect its high antifungal activity and chitinase activity, and the principle for the construction of the thermostable chitinase was well explained by its crystal structure. Our results provide a useful strategy to enhance the thermostability of this enzyme family and to use the thermostable mutant as a seed for antifungal agents for practical use.",

Here we show that - catenin, a mechanosensitive protein that is classically associated with cadherin-based adhesions, directly interacts with and regulates integrin adhesions. -catenin is recruited to the edges of mesenchymal cells, where it interacts with F-actin. This is followed by mutual retrograde flow of -catenin and F-actin from the cell edge, during which -catenin interacts with vinculin within integrin adhesions. This interaction affects adhesion maturation, stress-fiber assembly, and force transmission to the matrix. In epithelial cells, -catenin is present in cell-cell adhesions and absent from cell-matrix adhesions. However, when these cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, -catenin transitions to cell-matrix adhesions, where it facilitates proper mechanosensing. This is highlighted by the ability of -catenin-depleted cells to grow on soft matrices. These results suggest a dual role of -catenin in mechanosensing, through both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions.",

How the multimodal information can be integrated to obtain a common cell type identification, however, poses a computational challenge. Multilayer graphs provide a natural representation of multi-omic single-cell sequencing datasets, and finding cell clusters may be understood as a multilayer graph partition problem.\n\nWe introduce two spectral algorithms on multilayer graphs, spectral clustering on multilayer graphs (SCML) and the weighted locally linear (WLL) method, to cluster cells in multi-omic single-cell sequencing datasets. We connect these algorithms through a unifying mathematical framework that represents each layer using a Hamiltonian operator and a mixture of its eigenstates to integrate the multiple graph layers, demonstrating in the process that the WLL method is a rigorous multilayer spectral graph theoretic reformulation of the popular Seurat weighted nearest neighbor (WNN) algorithm. Implementing our algorithms and applying them to a CITE-seq dataset of cord blood mononuclear cells yields results similar to the Seurat WNN analysis. Our work thus extends spectral methods to multimodal single-cell data analysis.\n\nThe code used in this study can be found at https://github.com/jssong-lab/sc-spectrum",

We tested the performance of the BC method and compared it with the Sterivex filtration/extraction method using aquarium and river water samples. We observed that using the BC method, the same concentration of the extracted DNA was obtained with 1/20-1/40 of the filtration volume of the Sterivex method, suggesting that the BC method can be widely used for eDNA measurement. In addition, we could perform on-site measurements of eDNA within 30 min using a mobile PCR device. Using the BC method, filtration and extraction could be performed easily and quickly. The PCR results obtained by the BC method were similar to those obtained by the Sterivex method. The BC method required fewer steps and therefore, the risk of DNA contamination could be reduced.

Pearl millet is a cereal crop that plays a major role for food security in arid regions of sub Saharan Africa and India. We previously showed that root-adhering soil mass is a heritable trait in pearl millet and that it correlates with changes in rhizosphere microbiota structure and functions. Here, we studied the correlation between root-adhering soil mass and root hair development, root architecture, and symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and we analysed the genetic control of this trait using genome wide association (GWAS) combined with bulk segregant analysis and gene expression studies. Root-adhering soil mass was weakly correlated only to root hairs traits in pearl millet. Twelve QTLs for rhizosheath formation were identified by GWAS. Bulk segregant analysis on a biparental population validated five of these QTLs. Combining genetics with a comparison of global gene expression in the root tip of contrasted inbred lines revealed candidate genes that might control rhizosheath formation in pearl millet. Our study indicates that rhizosheath formation is under complex genetic control in pearl millet and suggests that it is mainly regulated by root exudation.\n\nHighlightFormation of the rhizosheath, a layer of soil adhering to the root, is under complex genetic control in pearl millet and is mainly regulated by root exudation.",

However, G can evolve in response to selection and may also be viewed as a product of adaptive evolution. Convergent evolution of G in similar environments would suggest that G evolves adaptively, but it is difficult to disentangle such effects from phylogeny. Here, we use the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards to ask whether convergence of G accompanies the repeated evolution of habitat specialists, or ecomorphs, across the Greater Antilles. We measured G in seven species representing three ecomorphs (trunk-crown, trunk- ground, and grass-bush). We found that the overall structure of G does not converge. Instead, the structure of G is well conserved and displays a phylogenetic signal consistent with Brownian motion. However, several elements of G showed signatures of convergence, indicating that some aspects of genetic architecture have been shaped by selection. Most notably, genetic correlations between limb traits and body traits were weaker in long-legged trunk-ground species, suggesting effects of recurrent selection on limb length. Our results demonstrate that common selection pressures may have subtle but consistent effects on the evolution of G, even as its overall structure remains conserved.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam1 into 38,016 isoforms provides neurons with a unique molecular code for self-recognition and self-avoidance. A canonical model suggests that homophilic binding of identical Dscam1 isoforms on sister branches of mushroom body (MB) axons supports segregation with high fidelity, even when only a single isoform is expressed. Here we generated a series of mutant flies with a single exon 4, 6, or 9 variant, encoding 1,584, 396, or 576 potential isoforms, respectively. Surprisingly, most of the mutants in the latter two groups exhibited obvious defects in the growth, branching, and segregation of MB axonal sister branches. This demonstrates that repertoires of 396 and 576 Dscam1 isoforms were not sufficient for normal patterning of axonal branches. Moreover, reducing Dscam1 levels largely reversed the defects caused by reduced isoform diversity, suggesting a functional link between Dscam1 expression levels and isoform diversity. Taken together, these results indicate that canonical self-avoidance alone does not explain the function of Dscam1 in MB axonal wiring.",

The control and significance of morphological changes, however, remain less defined. We show marked changes in morphology and actin architectures during differentiation that depend on Arp2/3 complex but not formin activity. Inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity pharmacologically or genetically does not block exit from naive pluripotency but attenuates increases in EpiLC markers. We find that inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity delays formative pluripotency and causes globally defective lineage specification as indicated by RNA-sequencing, with significant effects on TBX3-depedendent transcriptional programs. We also identify two previously unreported indicators of mESC differentiation; MRTF and FHL2, which have inverse Arp2/3 complex-dependent nuclear translocation. Our findings on Arp2/3 complex activity in differentiation and the established role of formins in EMT indicate that these two actin nucleators regulate distinct modes of epithelial plasticity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIArp2/3 complex activity is necessary for morphology changes during differentiation\nC_LIO_LIArp2/3 complex activity regulates transcriptional markers of differentiation\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity delays entry into formative pluripotency\nC_LIO_LIArp2/3 complex activity-dependent shuttling of FHL2 and MRTF occurs in mESCs\nC_LI",

The transferrin as an essential component of iron-metabolism was suggested to be a link between iron transport associated diseases and COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human whole blood was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The analysis and deconvolution of the thermal transition curves showed that the Tm of transferrin related second peak decreased by 5.16 {degrees}C (6.4%) in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The ratio of the under-curve area of the two main peaks was greatly affected while the total enthalpy of the heat denaturation was nearly unchanged in the presence of the virus.\n\nBased on the results it is possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 through binding to transferrin can influence its Fe3+ uptake by inducing thermodynamic changes. Transferrin may stay in iron-free apo-conformational state, which probably depends on the SARS-CoV-2 concentration.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 might induce disturbance in the erythropoiesis due to the free iron overload generated iron toxicity. As a late consequence iron toxicity related hepatocellular carcinoma can even develop.\n\nOur work can support the basic role of transferrin in COVID-19 related severe diseases.",

However, it is less clear that vaccine-induced immunity is able to limit infection-elicited inflammation in the lower respiratory tract. To assess this, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples post-SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 challenge from rhesus macaques vaccinated with mRNA-1273 in a dose-reduction study. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling revealed a broad cellular landscape 48 hours post-challenge with distinct inflammatory signatures that correlated with viral RNA burden in the lower respiratory tract. These inflammatory signatures included phagocyte-restricted expression of chemokines such as CXCL10 (IP10) and CCL3 (MIP-1A) and the broad expression of interferon-induced genes such as MX1, ISG15, and IFIT1. Induction of these inflammatory profiles was suppressed by prior mRNA-1273 vaccination in a dose-dependent manner, and negatively correlated with pre-challenge serum and lung antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike. These observations were replicated and validated in a second independent macaque challenge study using the B.1.351/beta-variant of SARS-CoV-2. These data support a model wherein vaccine-elicited antibody responses restrict viral replication following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, including limiting viral dissemination to the lower respiratory tract and infection-mediated inflammation and pathogenesis.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySingle cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrates that mRNA-1273 vaccination limits the development of lower respiratory tract inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 challenged rhesus macaques",

Importantly, obtained data can be directly used for multiple applications in fields such as fundamental biology, toxicology or medicine. Particle movement in biorelevant media can be readily monitored using microscopy and converted into time-resolved trajectories using freely available tracking software. However, translation into tangible and meaningful parameters is time-consuming and not always intuitive. Thus, we developed a new software - MPTHub - as an open-access, stand-alone, user-friendly tool for the rapid and reliable analysis of particle trajectories extracted from video microscopy. The software was programmed using Python and allowed to import and analyze trajectory data, and export relevant data such as individual and ensemble time-averaged mean square displacements and effective diffusivity, and anomalous transport exponent. Data processing was reliable, fast (total processing time of less than 10 sec) and required minimal memory resources (up to a maximum of around 150 MB in RAM). Demonstration of software applicability was conducted by studying the transport of different polystyrene nanoparticles (100-200 nm) in mucus surrogates. Overall, MPTHub represents a freely available software tool that can be used even by unexperienced users for studying the transport of particles in biorelevant media.",

The molecular mechanisms of paraspeckle formation have been mainly studied using human or mouse cells, and it is not known if the same molecular components are involved in the formation of paraspeckles in other mammalian species. We thus investigated the expression pattern of NEAT1_2 in naked mole-rats (nNEAT1_2), which exhibit extreme longevity and lower susceptibility to cancer. In the intestine, nNEAT1_2 is widely expressed along the entire intestinal epithelium, which is different from the expression of mNeat1_2, that is restricted to the cells of the distal tip in mice. Notably, the expression of FUS, a FET family RNA binding protein, essential for the formation of paraspeckles both in humans and mice, was absent in the distal part of the intestinal epithelium in naked mole-rats. Instead, mRNAs of other FET family proteins EWSR1 and TAF15 were expressed in the distal region. Exogenous expression of these proteins in Fus-deficient murine embryonic fibroblast cells rescued the formation of paraspeckles. These observations suggest that nNEAT1_2 recruits different set of RNA binding proteins in a cell type-specific manner during the formation of paraspeckles in different organisms.",

This individuality is typically attributed to variation in host genetics, diets, environments, and medications, but it could also emerge from fundamental ecological forces that shape microbiota more generally. Here we leverage extensive gut microbial time series from wild baboons--hosts who experience little interindividual dietary and environmental heterogeneity--to test whether gut microbial dynamics are synchronized across hosts or largely idiosyncratic. Despite their shared lifestyles, baboon microbiome dynamics were only weakly synchronized. The strongest synchrony occurred among baboons living in the same social group, likely because group members range over the same habitat and simultaneously encounter the same sources of food and water. However, this synchrony was modest compared to each hosts personalized dynamics. Indeed, host-specific factors, especially host identity, explained 10 times the deviance in longitudinal microbial dynamics, compared to factors shared across hosts. These results contribute to mounting evidence that highly idiosyncratic gut microbiomes are not an artifact of modern human environments, and that synchronizing forces in the gut microbiome (e.g., shared environments, diets, and microbial dispersal) are often not strong enough to overwhelm drivers of microbiome personalization, including host genetics, priority effects, horizontal gene transfer, and functional redundancy.",

The growing appreciation of immune cell interactions within disease environments has led to significant efforts to develop protein- and cell-based therapeutic strategies. A better understanding of these cell-cell interactions will enable the development of effective immunotherapies. However, characterizing these complex cellular interactions at molecular resolution in their native biological contexts remains challenging. To address this, we introduce photocatalytic cell tagging (PhoTag), a modality agnostic platform for profiling cell-cell interactions. Using photoactivatable flavin-based cofactors, we generate phenoxy radical tags for targeted labeling at the cell surface. Through various targeting modalities (e.g. MHC-Multimer, antibody, single domain antibody (VHH)) we deliver a flavin photocatalyst for cell tagging within monoculture, co-culture, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. PhoTag enables highly selective tagging of the immune synapse between an immune cell and an antigen-presenting cell through targeted labeling at the cell-cell junction. This allowed for the ability to profile gene expression-level differences between interacting and bystander cell populations. Given the modality agnostic and spatio-temporal nature of PhoTag, we envision its broad utilization to detect and profile intercellular interactions within an immune synapse and other confined cellular regions for any biological system.",

Cryo-electron microscopy structures of nine band 3-associated complexes reveal that protein 4.2 stabilizes the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 dimer. In turn, the superhelix-shaped ankyrin binds to this protein 4.2 via ankyrin repeats (ARs) 6-13 and to another band 3 dimer via ARs 17-20, bridging two band 3 dimers in the ankyrin complex.

The extent to which this structure, the VGIC-PD fold, relies on the extensive quaternary interactions observed in PD assemblies is unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of three bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel (BacNaO_SCPLOWVC_SCPLOW) pores that adopt a surprising set of non-canonical quaternary structures and yet maintain the native tertiary structure of the PD monomer. This context-independent structural robustness demonstrates that the VGIC-PD fold, the fundamental VGIC structural building block, can adopt its native-like tertiary fold independent of native quaternary interactions. In line with this observation, we find that the VGIC-PD fold is not only present throughout the VGIC superfamily and other channel classes but has homologs in diverse transmembrane and soluble proteins. Characterization of the structures of two synthetic Fabs (sFabs) that recognize the VGIC-PD fold shows that such sFabs can bind purified full-length channels and indicates that non-canonical quaternary PD assemblies can occur in the context of complete VGICs. Together, our data demonstrate that the VGIC-PD structure can fold independently of higher-order assembly interactions and suggest that full-length VGIC PDs can access previously unknown non-canonical quaternary states. These PD properties have deep implications for understanding how the complex quaternary architectures of VGIC superfamily members are achieved and point to possible evolutionary origins of this fundamental VGIC structural element.",

However, research and development has been hindered by the lack of suitable serum-free media that enable the robust expansion of relevant cells (e.g., muscle satellite cells) over multiple passages. Recently, a low-cost serum-free media (B8) was described for induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, we adapt this media for bovine satellite cells and show that the addition of a single component, recombinant albumin, renders B8 suitable for the long-term expansion of cells without sacrificing myogenicity. We show that this new media (Beefy-9) maintains robust cell growth over the entire culture period tested (seven passages) with an average growth rate of 39 hours per population doubling. Along with demonstrated efficacy for bovine cells, this work provides a promising starting-point for developing serum-free media for cultures from other meat-relevant species. Ultimately, this work offers a promising foundation for escaping the reliance on serum in cultured meat research, thereby accelerating the field.",

For apo NTS1, 19F-NMR spectra reveal an ensemble of at least three conformational substates (one inactive and two active-like) in equilibrium that exchange on the ms-s timescale. Dynamic NMR experiments reveal that these substates follow a linear three-site exchange process that is both thermodynamically and kinetically remodeled by orthosteric ligands. As previously observed in other GPCRs, the full agonist is insufficient to completely stabilize the active-like state. The inactive substate is abolished upon coupling to {beta}-arrestin-1 or the C-terminal helix of Gq, which comprises 60% of the GPCR/G protein interface surface area. Whereas {beta}-arrestin-1 exclusively selects for pre-existing active-like substates, the Gq peptide induces a new substate. Both transducer molecules promote substantial line-broadening of active-like states suggesting contributions from additional s-ms exchange processes. Together, our study suggests i) the NTS1 allosteric activation mechanism may be alternatively dominated by induced fit or conformational selection depending on the coupled transducer, and ii) the available static structures do not represent the entire conformational ensemble observed in solution.",

We used an adult Drosophila model of NGLY1 deficiency to conduct an in vivo, unbiased, small molecule, repurposing screen of FDA-approved drugs to identify therapeutic compounds. Seventeen molecules rescued lethality in a patient-specific NGLY1 deficiency model, including multiple serotonin and dopamine modulators. Exclusive dNGLY1 expression in serotonin and dopamine neurons, in an otherwise dNGLY1-null fly, was sufficient to rescue lethality. Further, genetic modifier and transcriptomic data supports the importance of serotonin signaling in NGLY1 deficiency. Connectivity Map analysis identified glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibition as a potential therapeutic mechanism for NGLY1 deficiency, which we experimentally validated with TWS119 and lithium. Strikingly, GSK3 inhibitors and a serotonin modulator rescued size defects in dNGLY1 deficient larvae upon proteasome inhibition, suggesting that these compounds act through NRF1, a transcription factor that regulates proteasome expression. This study reveals the importance of the serotonin pathway in NGLY1 deficiency, and serotonin modulators or GSK3 inhibitors may be effective therapeutics for this rare disease.",

Non-neuronal and neuronal cell types were identified and the expression persisted at least during three days. Kenyon cells, optic lobe neurons and protocerebral lobe neurons were electroporated. Astrocyte-like glia cells, fibrous lamellar glia cells and cortex glia cells were identified. Viral transduction targeted one specific type of glia cells that could not be identified. EGFP positive cells were rather variable after electroporation, and viral transduction resulted in more homogenous groups of positive cells.

Due to the involvement of strong coordination interactions, the energy landscape dictating the metal ion binding is intrinsically rugged. How metal ions achieve fast binding by overcoming the landscape ruggedness and thereby efficiently mediate protein allostery is elusive. By performing molecular dynamics simulations for the Ca2+ binding mediated allostery of the calmodulin (CaM) domains, each containing two Ca2+ binding helix-loop-helix motifs (EF-hands), we revealed the key role of water-bridged interactions in Ca2+ binding and protein allostery. The bridging water molecules between Ca2+ and binding residue reduces the ruggedness of ligand exchange landscape by acting as a lubricant, facilitating the Ca2+ coupled protein allostery.\n\nCalcium-induced rotation of the helices in the EF-hands, with the hydrophobic core serving as the pivot, leads to exposure of hydrophobic sites for target binding. Intriguingly, despite being structurally similar, the response of the two symmetrically arranged EF-hands upon Ca2+ binding is asymmetric. Breakage of symmetry is needed for efficient allosteric communication between the EF-hands. The key roles that water molecules play in driving allosteric transitions are likely to be general in other metal ion mediated protein allostery.",

Aiding the urgent demand for novel therapeutic targets, comparative genomics studies between pathogens and their apathogenic relatives shed light on the genetic basis of human-pathogen interaction. Yet, existing studies are limited in taxonomic scope, sensing of the phylogenetic signal, and resolution by largely analyzing genes isolated from their functional contexts. Here, we explored more than 3,000 Acinetobacter genomes in a phylogenomic framework integrating orthology-based phylogenetic profiling and microsynteny conservation analyses. This allowed to delineate gene clusters in the type strain A. baumannii ATCC 19606 whose evolutionary conservation indicates a functional integration of the subsumed genes. These evolutionarily stable gene clusters (ESGCs) reveal metabolic pathways, transcriptional regulators residing next to their targets but also tie together sub-clusters with distinct functions to form higher-order functional modules. We shortlisted 150 ESGCs that either co-emerged with, or are found preferentially in, the pathogenic ACB clade. They unveil, at an unprecedented resolution, the genetic makeup that coincides with the manifestation of the pathogenic phenotype in the last common ancestor of the ACB clade. Key innovations are the remodeling of the regulatory-effector cascade connecting LuxR/LuxI quorum sensing via an intermediate messenger to biofilm formation, the extension of micronutrient scavenging systems, and the increase of metabolic flexibility by exploiting carbon sources that are provided by the human host. Specifically, we could show that only members of the ACB clade use kynurenine as a sole carbon and energy source, a substance produced by humans to fine-tune the antimicrobial innate immune response. In summary, this study provides a rich and unbiased set of novel testable hypotheses on how pathogenic Acinetobacter interact with and ultimately infect their human host. They disclose promising routes for future therapeutic strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe spread of multi- and pan-drug resistant bacterial pathogens is a world-wide threat to human health. Understanding the genetics of host colonization and infection is essential for devising novel ways of treatment. Acinetobacter baumannii, a nosocomial pathogen ranked top by the World Health Organization in the list of bacteria for which novel therapeutic approaches are needed, is a prime example. Here, we have carved out the genetic make-up that distinguishes A. baumannii and its pathogenic next relatives comprising the A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex from other and mostly apathogenic Acinetobacter species. We found a rich spectrum of pathways and regulatory modules that reveals how the pathogens have modified biofilm formation, iron scavenging, and their carbohydrate metabolism to adapt to their human host. Among these, the capability to metabolize kynurenine is particularly intriguing. Humans produce this substance to contain bacterial invaders and to fine-tune the innate immune response. But A. baumannii and its allies have turned the table. They feed on kynurenine, and thus most likely also dysregulate human immune response. In summary, our study substantially deepens the understanding of how a highly critical pathogen interacts with its host, which substantially eases the identification of novel targets for innovative therapeutic strategies.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Computational methods play a pivotal role in drug discovery and are widely applied in virtual screening, structure optimization, and compound activity profiling. Over the last decades, almost all the attention in medicinal chemistry has been directed to protein-ligand binding, and computational tools have been created with this target in mind. With novel discoveries of functional RNAs and their possible applications, RNAs have gained considerable attention as potential drug targets. However, the availability of bioinformatics tools for nucleic acids is limited. Here, we introduce fingeRNAt - a software tool for detecting non-covalent interactions formed in complexes of nucleic acids with ligands. The program detects nine types of interactions: (i) hydrogen and (ii) halogen bonds, (iii) cation-anion, (iv) pi-cation, (v) pi-anion, (vi) pi-stacking, (vii) inorganic ion-mediated, (viii) water-mediated, and (ix) lipophilic interactions. However, the scope of detected interactions can be easily expanded using a simple plugin system. In addition, detected interactions can be visualized using the associated PyMOL plugin, which facilitates the analysis of medium-throughput molecular complexes. Interactions are also encoded and stored as a bioinformatics-friendly Structural Interaction Fingerprint (SIFt) - a binary string where the respective bit in the fingerprint is set to 1 if a particular interaction is present and to 0 otherwise. This output format, in turn, enables high-throughput analysis of interaction data using data analysis techniques. We present applications of fingeRNAt-generated interaction fingerprints for visual and computational analysis of RNA-ligand complexes, including analysis of interactions formed in experimentally determined RNA-small molecule ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank. We propose interaction-based similarity based on fingerprints as an alternative measure to RMSD to recapitulate complexes with similar interactions but different folding. We present an application of molecular fingerprints for the clustering of molecular complexes. This approach can be used to group ligands that form similar binding networks and thus have similar biological properties.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWe present a novel bioinformatic tool, fingeRNAt, aiming to support scientists in the analysis of complexes of nucleic acids with various types of ligands. The software automatically detects non-covalent interactions and presents them in a form that is understandable to both humans and computers. Such data can help decipher the nature of interactions between nucleic acids and ligands and determine the main factors responsible for forming such complexes in nature. fingeRNAt finds application in multiple studies, both structure- and drug discovery-oriented. Here, we analyzed the experimentally solved structures of RNA complexes with small molecules to determine which binding features are most prevalent, i.e., most common interactions or their hot spots. The results of this analysis may help elucidate the mechanisms of binding and design new active molecules. Moreover, we propose to use the data generated by our software as a new metric for the quantitative comparison of two molecule complexes. We have shown that it is more reliable than the currently used methods in certain \"difficult\" cases. We have shown that the results of our program can be used for high-throughput analysis of molecular complexes and the search for active molecules. We are confident that fingeRNAt will be a valuable tool for exploring the complex world of interactions of nucleic acids with ligands.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Gene-based association analysis is an effective gene mapping tool. Many gene-based methods have been proposed recently. However, their power depends on the underlying genetic architecture, which is rarely known in complex traits, and so it is likely that a combination of such methods could serve as a universal approach. Several frameworks combining different gene-based methods have been developed. However, they all imply a fixed set of methods, weights and functional annotations. Moreover, most of them use individual phenotypes and genotypes as input data. Here, we introduce sumSTAAR, a framework for gene-based association analysis using summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It is an extended and modified version of STAAR framework proposed by Li and colleagues in 2020. The sumSTAAR framework offers a wider range of gene-based methods to combine. It allows the user to arbitrarily define a set of these methods, weighting functions and probabilities of genetic variants being causal. The methods used in the framework were adapted to analyse genes with large number of SNPs to decrease the running time. The framework includes the polygene pruning procedure to guard against the influence of the strong GWAS signals outside the gene. We also present new improved matrices of correlations between the genotypes of variants within genes. These matrices estimated on a sample of 265,000 individuals are a state-of-the-art replacement of widely used matrices based on the 1000 Genomes Project data.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGene-based association analysis is an effective gene mapping tool.

    "preprint_abstract": "How does the brain prioritize among the contents of working memory (WM) to appropriately guide behavior? Using inverted encoding modeling (IEM), previous work (Wan et al., 2020) showed that unprioritized memory items (UMI) are actively represented in the brain but in a \"flipped\", or opposite, format compared to prioritized memory items (PMI). To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the UMI-to-PMI representational transformation, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an LSTM (long short-term memory) architecture to perform a 2-back working memory task. Although visualization of LSTM hidden layer activity using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) suggested that stimulus representations undergo a smooth rotational transformation across the trial, demixed (d)PCA of the same data decomposed this pattern into a cascade of multiple trajectories, each with a different time course, unfolding within UMI and PMI subspaces. The application of the same analyses to the EEG dataset of Wan et al. (2020) indicated that an items trajectory through the UMI subspace closely mirrored that of the RNN, but that its trajectory through the PMI subspace differed markedly from the RNN. It may be a general principle that, at the level of the representational code, information held in WM undergoes priority-based transformations that allow for its retention while preventing it from interfering with concurrent behavior. Implementational details of this process may vary across model systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryHow is information held in working memory (WM) but outside the current focus of attention? Motivated by previous neuroimaging studies, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform a 2-back WM task that entails shifts of an items priority status. Dimensionality reduction of the resultant activity in the hidden layer of the RNN allowed us to characterize how a stimulus items representation follows a transformational trajectory through high-dimensional representational space as its priority status changes from memory probe to unprioritized to prioritized. This work illustrates the value of artificial neural networks for assessing and refining hypotheses about mechanisms for information processing in the brain.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Exposures to a hypomagnetic field can affect biological processes. Recently, it has been observed that hypomagnetic field exposure can adversely affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice. In the same study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hypomagnetic field effects has been demonstrated. However, the mechanistic reasons behind this effect are not clear. This study proposes a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of ROS production and the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a hypomagnetic field. The results of our calculations favor a singlet-born radical pair over a triplet-born radical pair. Our model predicts hypomagnetic field effects on the triplet/singlet yield of comparable strength as the effects observed in experimental studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our predictions are also in qualitative agreement with experimental results on superoxide concentration and other observed ROS effects. We also predict the effects of applied magnetic fields and oxygen isotopic substitution on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings strengthen the idea that nature might harness quantum resources in the context of the brain.\n\nAuthor summaryExposure to magnetic fields influences many neurobiological processes. The formation of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal region of the adult brain plays a crucial role in learning and memory. It can be adversely affected by shielding the earths magnetic field, and this effect is intimately related to ROS concentration. In this study, we have developed a quantum mechanical model to explain this magnetic field dependence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our model is also consistent with the observed ROS effects.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Deciding about courses of action involves minimizing costs and maximizing benefits. Decision neuroscience studies have implicated both the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC and dmPFC) in signaling goal value and action cost, but the precise functional role of these regions is still a matter of debate. Here, we suggest a more general functional partition that applies not only to decisions but also to judgments about goal value (expected reward) and action cost (expected effort). In this conceptual framework, cognitive representations related to options (reward value and effort cost) are dissociated from metacognitive representations (confidence and deliberation) related to solving the task (providing a judgment or making a choice). Thus, we used an original approach with the goal of identifying consistencies across several preference tasks, from likeability ratings to binary decisions involving both attribute integration and option comparison. FMRI results confirmed the vmPFC as a generic valuation system, its activity increasing with reward value and decreasing with effort cost. In contrast, more dorsal regions were not concerned with the valuation of options but with metacognitive variables, confidence level being reflected in mPFC activity and deliberation time in dmPFC activity. Thus, there was a dissociation between the effort attached to choice options (represented in the vmPFC) and the effort invested in deliberation (represented in the dmPFC), the latter being expressed in pupil dilation. More generally, assessing commonalities across preference tasks might help reaching a unified view of the neural mechanisms underlying the cost/benefit tradeoffs that drive human behavior.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Lesion studies in macaques suggest dissociable functions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial frontal cortex (MFC), with OFC being essential for goal-directed decision making and MFC supporting social cognition. Bilateral amygdala damage results in impairments in both of these domains. There are extensive reciprocal connections between these prefrontal areas and the amygdala; however, it is not known whether the dissociable roles of OFC and MFC depend on functional interactions with the amygdala. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with crossed surgical disconnection of the amygdala and either MFC (MFC x AMY, n=4) or OFC (OFC x AMY, n=4) to a group of unoperated controls (CON, n=5). All monkeys were assessed for their performance on two tasks to measure: (1) food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of social and nonsocial stimuli in a test of social interest, and (2) object choices based on current food value using reinforcer devaluation in a test of goal-directed decision making. Compared to the CON group, the MFC x AMY group, but not the OFC x AMY group, showed significantly reduced food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of conspecifics, indicating reduced social valuation and/or interest. By contrast, on the devaluation task, group OFC x AMY, but not group MFC x AMY, displayed deficits on object choices following changes in food value. These data indicate that the MFC and OFC must functionally interact with the amygdala to support normative social and nonsocial valuation, respectively.\n\nSignificance StatementAscribing value to conspecifics (social) vs. objects (nonsocial) may be supported by distinct but overlapping brain networks. Here we test whether two nonoverlapping regions of the prefrontal cortex, the medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, must causally interact with the amygdala to sustain social valuation and goal-directed decision making, respectively. We found that these prefrontal-amygdala circuits are functionally dissociable, lending support for the idea that medial frontal and orbital frontal cortex make independent contributions to cognitive appraisals of the environment. These data provide a neural framework for distinct value assignment processes and may enhance our understanding of the cognitive deficits observed following brain injury or in the development of mental health disorders.",

Global policies have called for expanding and connecting the worlds protected areas (PAs) to curtail the crisis, yet how well PA networks currently support wildlife movement, and where connectivity conservation or restoration is most critical, have never been mapped globally. Here, we map the functional connectivity (how animals move through landscapes) of the worlds terrestrial PAs for the first time. Also, going beyond existing global connectivity indices, we quantify national PA-connectedness using an approach that meaningfully represents animal movement through anthropogenic landscapes. We find that reducing the human footprint may improve national PA-connectivity more than adding new PAs; however, both strategies are critical for improving and preserving connectivity in places where the predicted flow of animal movement is highly concentrated. We show that the majority of critical connectivity areas (CCAs) (defined as globally important areas of concentrated animal movements) remain unprotected. Of these, 72% overlap with previously-identified global conservation priority areas, while 3% of CCAs occur within moderate to heavily modified lands. Conservation and restoration of CCAs could safeguard connectivity of the worlds PAs, and dovetail with previously identified global conservation priorities.",

Here, we estimate the minimum land area to secure important sites for terrestrial fauna, ecologically intact areas, and the optimal locations for representation of species ranges and ecoregions. We discover that at least 64 million km2 (44% of terrestrial area) requires conservation attention. Over 1.8 billion people live on these lands so responses that promote agency, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million km2 of land requiring conservation could be lost to intensive human land-uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, there is a seven-fold difference between the amount of habitat converted under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis. Appropriate targets in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to ensure conservation of the identified land would contribute substantially to safeguarding biodiversity.",

We show that the active condensin complex entraps the bases of a DNA loop in two separate chambers. Single-molecule and cryo-electron microscopy provide evidence for a power-stroke movement at the first chamber that feeds DNA into the SMC-kleisin ring upon ATP binding, while the second chamber holds on upstream of the same DNA double helix. Unlocking the strict separation of  motor and  anchor chambers turns condensin from a one-sided into a bidirectional DNA loop extruder. We conclude that the orientation of two topologically bound DNA segments during the course of the SMC reaction cycle determines the directionality of DNA loop extrusion.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Haplodiploidy and paternal genome elimination (HD/PGE) are common in invertebrates, having evolved at least two dozen times, all from male heterogamety (i.e., systems with X chromosomes). However, why X chromosomes are important for the evolution of HD/PGE remains debated. The Haploid Viability Hypothesis posits that X-linked genes promote the evolution of male haploidy by facilitating purging recessive deleterious mutations. The Intragenomic Conflict Hypothesis holds that conflict between genes drives genetic system turnover; under this model, X-linked genes could promote the evolution of male haploidy due to conflicts with autosomes over sex ratios and genetic transmission. We studied lineages where we can distinguish these hypotheses: species with germline PGE that retain an XX/X0 sex determination system (gPGE+X). Because evolving PGE in these cases involves changes in transmission without increases in male hemizygosity, a high degree of X linkage in these systems is predicted by the Intragenomic Conflict Hypothesis but not the Haploid Viability Hypothesis. To quantify the degree of X linkage, we sequenced and compared 7 gPGE+X species genomes with 11 related species with typical XX/XY or XX/X0 genetic systems, representing three transitions to gPGE. We find highly increased X linkage in both modern and ancestral genomes of gPGE+X species compared to non-gPGE relatives, and recover a significant positive correlation between percent X linkage and the evolution of gPGE. These are among the first empirical results suggesting a role for intragenomic conflict in the evolution of novel genetic systems like HD/PGE.\n\nSignificance StatementSex determination systems such as haplodiploidy, in which males gene transmission is haploid, are surprisingly common, however, the evolutionary paths to these systems are poorly understood. X chromosomes may play a particularly important role, either by increasing survival of males with only maternal genomes, or due to conflicts between X-chromosomal and autosomal genes. We studied X-chromosome gene richness in three arthropod lineages in which males are diploid as adults but only transmit their maternally-inherited haploid genome. We find that species with such atypical systems have far more X chromosomal genes than related diploid species. These results suggest that conflict between genetic elements within the genome drives the evolution of unusual sex determination systems.",

    "preprint_abstract": "In {sigma}-dependent transcriptional pausing, the transcription initiation factor {sigma}, translocating with RNA polymerase (RNAP), makes sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions with a promoter-like sequence element in the transcribed region, inducing pausing. It has been proposed that, in {sigma}-dependent pausing, the RNAP active center can access off-pathway \"backtracked\" states that are substrates for the transcript-cleavage factors of the Gre family, and on-pathway \"scrunched\" states that mediate pause escape. Here, using site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking to define positions of the RNAP trailing and leading edges and of {sigma} relative to DNA at the{lambda} PR promoter, we show directly that {sigma}-dependent pausing in the absence of GreB in vitro predominantly involves a state backtracked by 2-4 bp, and that {sigma}-dependent pausing in the presence of GreB in vitro and in vivo predominantly involves a state scrunched by 2-3 bp. Analogous experiments with a library of 47 ([~]16,000) transcribed-region sequences show that the state scrunched by 2-3 bp--and only that state--is associated with the consensus sequence, T-3N-2Y-1G+1, (where -1 corresponds to the position of the RNA 3 end), which is identical to the consensus for pausing in initial transcription, and which is related to the consensus for pausing in transcription elongation. Experiments with heteroduplex templates show that sequence information at position T-3 resides in the DNA nontemplate strand. A cryo-EM structure of a complex engaged in {sigma}-dependent pausing reveals positions of DNA scrunching on the DNA nontemplate and template strands and suggests that position T-3 of the consensus sequence exerts its effects by facilitating scrunching.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Rapid identification of newly emerging or circulating viruses is an important first step toward managing the public health response to potential outbreaks. A portable virus capture device coupled with label-free Raman Spectroscopy holds the promise of fast detection by rapidly obtaining the Raman signature of a virus followed by a machine learning approach applied to recognize the virus based on its Raman spectrum. In this paper, we present a machine learning analysis on Raman spectra of human and avian viruses. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier specifically designed for spectral data achieves very high accuracy for a variety of virus type or subtype identification tasks. In particular, it achieves 99% accuracy for classifying influenza virus type A vs. type B, 96% accuracy for classifying four subtypes of influenza A, 95% accuracy for differentiating enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and 99% for differentiating avian coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) from other avian viruses. Furthermore, interpretation of neural net responses in the trained CNN model using a full-gradient algorithm highlights Raman spectral ranges that are most important to virus identification. By correlating ML-selected salient Raman ranges with the signature ranges of known biomolecules and chemical functional groups (e.g. amide, amino acid, carboxylic acid) we verify that our ML model effectively recognizes the Raman signatures of proteins, lipids and other vital functional groups present in different viruses and uses a weighted combination of these signatures to identify viruses. The accurate and interpretable machine learning model developed for Raman virus identification presents promising potential in a real-time virus detection system.\n\nSignificance StatementA portable micro-fluidic platform for virus capture promises rapid enrichment and label-free optical identification of viruses by Raman spectroscopy. A large Raman dataset collected on a variety of viruses enables the training of machine learning (ML) models capable of highly accurate and sensitive virus identification. The trained ML models can then be integrated with the portable device to provide real-time virus detection and identification capability. We validate this conceptual framework by presenting highly accurate virus type and subtype identification results using a convolutional neural network to classify Raman spectra of viruses.",

    "preprint_abstract": "To generate drug molecules of desired properties with computational methods is the holy grail in pharmaceutical research. Here we describe an AI strategy, retro drug design, or RDD, to generate novel small molecule drugs from scratch to meet predefined requirements, including but not limited to biological activity against a drug target, and optimal range of physicochemical and ADMET properties. Traditional predictive models were first trained over experimental data for the target properties, using an atom typing based molecular descriptor system, ATP. Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was then utilized to find the solutions in the ATP space defined by the target properties, and the deep learning model of Seq2Seq was employed to decode molecular structures from the solutions. To test feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate novel drugs that can activate  opioid receptor (MOR) and penetrate blood brain barrier (BBB). Starting from vectors of random numbers, RDD generated 180,000 chemical structures, of which 78% were chemically valid. About 42,000 (31%) of the valid structures fell into the property space defined by MOR activity and BBB permeability. Out of the 42,000 structures, only 267 chemicals were commercially available, indicating a high extent of novelty of the AI-generated compounds. We purchased and assayed 96 compounds, and 25 of which were found to be MOR agonists. These compounds also have excellent BBB scores. The results presented in this paper illustrate that RDD has potential to revolutionize the current drug discovery process and create novel structures with multiple desired properties, including biological functions and ADMET properties. Availability of an AI-enabled fast track in drug discovery is essential to cope with emergent public health threat, such as pandemic of COVID-19.",

We applied pSNAP to evaluate the effect of silmitasertib, a potential molecular therapy for cancer, and revealed acute translational repression through casein kinase II and mTOR pathways. We also characterized modifications on NPCs and demonstrated that the combination of different types of modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation in the N-terminal region of histone H1.5, can modulate interactions with ribosome-associated factors. Thus, pSNAP provides a framework for dissecting co-translational regulations on a proteome-wide scale.",

Currently, it is up to the practitioner to choose the most appropriate differential expression (DE) method out of over 100 DE tools available to date, each relying on their own assumptions to model scRNA-seq data. Here, we propose to use generalized linear models with the Tweedie distribution that can flexibly capture a large dynamic range of observed scRNA-seq data across experimental platforms induced by heavy tails, sparsity, or different count distributions to model the technological variability in scRNA-seq expression profiles. We also propose a zero-inflated Tweedie model that allows zero probability mass to exceed a traditional Tweedie distribution to model zero-inflated scRNA-seq data with excessive zero counts. Using both synthetic and published plate- and droplet-based scRNA-seq datasets, we performed a systematic benchmark evaluation of more than 10 representative DE methods and demonstrate that our method (Tweedieverse) outperforms the state-of-the-art DE approaches across experimental platforms in terms of statistical power and false discovery rate control.

    "preprint_abstract": "Pseudemys alabamensis is one of the most endangered turtle species in the United States due to its small population size and restricted geographic distribution in coastal Alabama and Mississippi. Increased urbanization and climate change impacts in the region further threaten this species. Populations of P. alabamensis are geographically isolated from one another by land and salt water, which could act as barriers to intraspecific gene flow. It is currently unknown how differentiated these isolated populations are from one another or whether they have experienced reductions in population size. Previous work found morphological differences between Alabama and Mississippi populations, suggesting that they may be evolutionarily distinct. Other Pseudemys turtles such as P. concinna and P. floridana occur within the same geographic area as P. alabamensis and are known to hybridize with each other. These more abundant species could further threaten the unique genetic identity of P. alabamensis through introgression. In order to evaluate the endangered status of P. alabamensis and the level of hybridization with other species, we used the mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region and nuclear microsatellite markers to assess genetic variation within and among populations of this species throughout its range and estimate admixture with co-occurring Pseudemys species. Genetic diversity of P. alabamensis was lower than expected at both markers (no variation in mtDNA and excess of homozygosity in microsatellites). We found evidence of genetic differentiation between Alabama and Mississippi populations as well as two populations (Fowl River, Alabama and Biloxi, Mississippi) with low estimated breeding sizes and signs of inbreeding. Finally, we found evidence of admixture of P. alabamensis with P. concinna/P. floridana and Pseudemys peninsularis (a species not native to Alabama or Mississippi). Our results indicate that P. alabamensis is highly endangered throughout its range and threatened by both low population sizes and hybridization. In order to improve the species chances of survival, focus should be placed on habitat preservation, maintenance of genetic diversity within both Mississippi and Alabama populations, and regular population monitoring activities such as nest surveillance and estimates of recruitment.",

In this study, we used the recently released Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip to compare such epigenetic modifications in C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2J (DBA) mice. We observed marked differences in age-associated DNA methylation in these commonly used inbred mouse strains, indicating that epigenetic clocks for one strain cannot be simply applied to other strains without further verification. In B6 mice age-associated hypomethylation prevailed with focused hypermethylation at CpG islands, whereas in DBA mice CpG islands revealed rather hypomethylation upon aging. Interestingly, the CpGs with highest age-correlation were still overlapping in B6 and DBA mice and included the genes Hsf4, Prima1, Aspa, and Wnt3a. Notably, Hsf4 and Prima1 were also top candidates in previous studies based on whole genome deep sequencing approaches. Furthermore, Hsf4, Aspa, and Wnt3a revealed highly significant age-associated DNA methylation in the homologous regions in human. Subsequently, we used pyrosequencing of the four relevant regions to establish a targeted epigenetic clock that provided very high correlation with chronological age in independent cohorts of B6 (R2 = 0.98) and DBA (R2 = 0.91). Taken together, the methylome differs extensively between B6 and DBA mice, while prominent age-associated changes are conserved among these strains and even in humans.

The semi-quantitative nature of existing podocyte estimation methods or podometrics hinders incorporation of such analysis into experimental and clinical pathologic workflows. Computational image analysis offers a robust approach to automate podometrics through objective quantification of cell and tissue structure. Toward this goal, we developed PodoCount, a computational tool for quantitative analysis of podocytes, and validated the generalizability of the tool across a diverse dataset.\n\nMethodsPodocyte nuclei and glomerular boundaries were labeled in murine whole kidney sections, n = 135, from six disease models and human kidney biopsies, n = 45, from diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients. Digital whole slide images (WSIs) of tissues were then acquired. Classical image analysis was applied to obtain podocyte nuclear and glomerular morphometrics. Statistically significant morphometric features, which correlated with each murine disease, were identified. Engineered features were also assessed for their ability to predict outcomes in human DN. PodoCount has been disbursed for other researchers as an open-source, cloud-based computational tool.\n\nResultsPodoCount offers highly accurate quantification of podocytes. Engineered podometric features were benchmarked against routine glomerular histopathology and were found to be significant predictors of disease diagnosis, proteinuria level, and clinical outcomes.\n\nConclusionsPodoCount offers high quantification performance in diverse murine disease models as well as in human DN. Resultant podometric features offers significant correlation with associated metadata as well as outcome. Our cloud-based end-user tool will provide a standardized approach for podometric analysis from gigapixel size WSIs in basic research and clinical practice.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Although cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (cEVs) are thought to play a pivotal role in promoting cancer progression events, their precise effect on neighboring normal cells is unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of pancreatic cancer ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) derived EVs on recipient non-tumorigenic pancreatic normal epithelial cells upon internalization. We show that PDAC cEVs increase the proliferation and invasive capability of treated normal cells. We further demonstrate that cEVs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in treated normal pancreatic epithelial cells within 24 hours. Subsequently, these cells release several inflammatory cytokines. Leveraging a layered multi-omics approach, we analyzed EV cargo from a panel of 6 PDAC and 2 normal pancreas cell lines, using multiple EV isolation methods. We found that cEVs were enriched for an array of biomolecules which can induce or regulate ER stress and the UPR, including palmitic acid, sphingomyelins, metabolic regulators of tRNA charging and proteins which regulate trafficking and degradation. We further show that palmitic acid, at doses relevant to those found in cEVs, is sufficient to induce ER stress in normal pancreas cells. These results suggest that cEV cargo packaging may be designed to disseminate proliferative and invasive characteristics upon internalization by distant recipient normal cells, hitherto unreported. This study is among the first to highlight a major role for PDAC cEVs to induce stress in treated normal pancreas cells that may modulate a systemic response leading to altered phenotypes. For the first time, our study implicates cEV transported palmitic acid as a potential driver in this process. These findings highlight the importance of EVs in mediating disease etiology and open potential areas of investigation toward understanding the role of cEV lipids in promoting cell transformation in the surrounding microenvironment.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Most neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease are proteinopathies linked to the toxicity of amyloid oligomers. Treatments to delay or cure these diseases are lacking. Using budding yeast, we report that the natural lipid tripentadecanoin induces expression of the nitric oxide oxidoreductase Yhb1 to prevent the formation of protein aggregates during aging and extends replicative lifespan. In mammals, tripentadecanoin induces expression of the Yhb1 orthologue, neuroglobin, to protect neurons against amyloid toxicity. Tripentadecanoin also rescues photoreceptors in a mouse model of retinal degeneration and retinal ganglion cells in a Rhesus monkey model of optic atrophy. Together, we propose that tripentadecanoin affects p-bodies to induce neuroglobin expression and offers a potential treatment for proteinopathies and retinal neurodegeneration.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe natural lipid tripentadecanoin is cytoprotective against amyloid oligomer toxicity and retinal neurodegeneration by inducing YHBI/neuroglobin expression in yeast and mammals.",

However, its role as a source of progenitors in the adult mammalian heart remains unclear due to lack of clear lineage markers and single-cell culture systems to elucidate epicardial progeny cell fate. We found that in vivo exposure of mice to physiological hypoxia induced adult epicardial cells to re-enter the cell cycle and to express a subset of developmental genes. Multiplex transcriptional profiling revealed a lineage relationship between epicardial cells and smooth muscle, stromal, and endothelial fates, and that physiological hypoxia promoted an endothelial cell fate. In vitro analyses of purified epicardial cells showed that cell growth and subsequent differentiation is dependent upon hypoxia, and that resident epicardial cells retain progenitor identity in the adult mammalian heart with self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential. These results point to a source of progenitor cells in the adult heart that can promote heart revascularization, providing an invaluable in vitro model for further studies.",

Here, we identify the underlying mechanism. We found that patient-derived motoneurons and GDAP1 knockdown SH-SY5Y cells display two phenotypes: more tubular mitochondria and a metabolism characterized by glutamine dependence and fewer cytosolic lipid droplets. GDAP1 interacts with the actin-depolymerizing protein Cofilin-1 in a redoxdependent manner, suggesting a role for actin signaling. Consistently, GDAP1 loss causes less F-actin close to mitochondria, which restricts mitochondrial localization of the fission factor dynamin-related protein 1, instigating tubularity. Changes in the actin cytoskeleton also disrupt mitochondria-ER contact sites. This results in lower mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, explaining the metabolic changes upon GDAP1 loss of function. Together, these findings reconcile GDAP1-associated phenotypes and implicate disrupted actin signaling in CMT4A pathophysiology.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundHuntingtons Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene for which no therapies are available. This mutation causes HTT protein misfolding and aggregation, preferentially affecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the basal ganglia. Transcriptional perturbations in synaptic genes and neuroinflammation are key processes that precede MSN dysfunction and motor symptom onset. Understanding the interplay between these processes is crucial to develop effective therapeutic strategies to treat HD. We investigated whether protein kinase CK2, a kinase upregulated in MSNs in HD and previously associated with Parkinsons disease (PD), participates in the regulation of neuroinflammation and synaptic function during HD progression.\n\nMethodsWe used the heterozygous knock-in zQ175 HD mouse model and compared that to zQ175 mice lacking one allele of CK2. We performed neuropathological analyses using immunohistochemistry, cytokine proteome profiling, RNA-seq analyses in the striatum, electrophysiological recordings, and behavioral analyses. We also used the murine immortalized striatal cell lines STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 and studied the expression of various synaptic genes dysregulated by CK2.\n\nResultsWe showed that CK2 haploinsufficiency in zQ175 mice ameliorated neuroinflammation, HTT aggregation, transcriptional alterations, excitatory synaptic transmission, and motor coordination deficits. RNA-seq analyses also revealed a connection between -syn, a protein associated with PD, and the transcriptional perturbations mediated by CK2 in HD. We also found increased -syn serine 129 phosphorylation (pS129--syn), a post-translational modification linked to -synucleinopathy, in the nuclei of MSNs in zQ175 mice and in patients with HD. Levels of pS129--syn were ameliorated in zQ175 lacking one allele of CK2.\n\nConclusionsOur data demonstrated that CK2 contributes to transcriptional dysregulation of synaptic genes and neuroinflammation in zQ175 mice and its depletion improved several HD-like phenotypes in this mouse model. These effects were related to increased phosphorylation of S129--syn in the striatum of HD mice, suggesting that CK2 contributes to worsening HD by mediating synucleinopathy. Our study highlights a possible convergent mechanism of neurodegeneration between HD and PD and suggests targeting CK2 as a potential therapeutic strategy to ameliorate synaptic dysfunction in HD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (fhFABPs) are among the main excreted/secreted proteins and have been shown to display anti-inflammatory properties. However, little is currently known regarding their impact on dendritic cells (DCs) and their subsequent capacity to prime specific CD4+ T cell subsets.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe immunomodulatory effects of both native F. hepatica extracts and recombinant fhFABPs were assessed on monocyte-derived human DCs (moDCs) and the underlying mechanism was next investigated using various approaches, including DC-allogenic T cell co-culture and DC phenotyping through transcriptomic, proteomic and FACS analyses. We mainly showed that fhFABP1 induced a tolerogenic-like phenotype in LPS-stimulated moDCs characterized by a dose-dependent increase in the cell-surface tolerogenic marker CD103 and IL-10 secretion, while DC co-stimulatory markers were not affected. A significant decrease in secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12p70 and IL-6 was also observed. In addition, these effects were associated with an increase in both Th2-on-Th1 ratio and IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T cells following DC-T cell co-culture. RNA sequencing and targeted proteomic analyses identified thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) as a non-canonical factor highly expressed and secreted by fhFABP1-primed moDCs. The effect of fhFABP1 on T cell skewing was abolished when using a TSP-1 blocking antibody during DC-T cell co-culture. Immunomodulation by helminth molecules has been linked to improved metabolic homeostasis during obesity. Although fhFABP1 injection in high-fat diet-fed obese mice induced a potent Th2 immune response in adipose tissue, it did not improved insulin sensitivity or glucose homeostasis.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceWe show that fhFABP1 modulates T cell polarization, notably by promoting DC TSP-1 secretion in vitro, without affecting metabolic homeostasis in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.",

To address this, vaccine candidates have been designed based on the relatively conserved HA stem domain and have shown protective efficacy in animal models. Oligomerization of the antigens either by fusion to oligomerization motifs or display on self-assembling nanoparticle scaffolds, can induce more potent immune responses compared to the corresponding monomeric antigen due to multivalent engagement of B-cells. Since nanoparticle display can increase manufacturing complexity, and often involves one or more mammalian cell expressed components, it is important to characterize and compare various display and oligomerization scaffolds. Using a structure guided approach, we successfully displayed multiple copies of a previously designed soluble, trimeric influenza stem domain immunogen, pH1HA10, on the ferritin like protein, MsDps2 (12 copies), Ferritin (24 copies) and Encapsulin (180 copies). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. The nanoparticle fusion immunogens were found to be well folded and bound to the influenza stem directed broadly neutralizing antibodies with high affinity. An 8.5 [A] Cryo-EM map of Msdps2-pH1HA10 confirmed the successful design of the nanoparticle fusion immunogen. Mice immunization studies with the soluble trimeric stem and nanoparticle fusion constructs revealed that all of them were immunogenic, and protected mice against homologous (A/Belgium/145-MA/2009) and heterologous (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) challenge with 10MLD50 mouse adapted virus. Although nanoparticle display conferred a small but statistically significant improvement in protection relative to the soluble trimer in a homologous challenge, heterologous protection was similar in both nanoparticle-stem immunized and trimeric stem immunized groups. Such rapidly producible, bacterially expressed antigens and nanoparticle scaffolds are useful modalities to tackle future influenza pandemics.",

These proteins, called alternative proteins, have failed to be annotated notably due to the short length of their open reading frame (less than 100 codons) or the enforced rule establishing that messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are monocystronic. Several alternative proteins were shown to be biologically active molecules and seem to be involved in a wide range of biological functions. However, genome wide exploration of the alternative proteome is still limited to a few species. In the present article we describe a deep peptidomics workflow which enabled the identification of 401 alternative proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Subcellular localization, protein domains and short linear motifs were predicted for 235 of the alternative proteins identified and point towards specific functions of these small proteins. Several alternative proteins had approximated abundances higher than their canonical counterparts, suggesting that these alternative proteins are actually the main products of their corresponding genes. Finally, we observed fourteen alternative proteins with developmentally regulated expression patterns and ten induced upon heat shock treatment of embryos, demonstrating stage or stress specific production of alternative proteins.",

We then acquired T1 maps on the ISMRM-NIST system phantom, as well as T1, MTR and MTsat maps in three healthy participants. We performed hierarchical shift function analysis in vivo to characterize the differences between scanners when the vendor-neutral sequence is used instead of commercial vendor implementations.

MBCs are a heterogeneous population whose function can be dictated by isotype or expression of particular surface proteins. Here, aided by antigen-specific B-cell tetramers, MBC populations were evaluated to discern their phenotype and function in response to infection with a non-lethal strain of P. yoelii. Infection of mice with P. yoelii 17X resulted in the production of two predominant MBC populations: somatically hypermutated isotype-switched (IgM-) and IgM+ MBCs that co-expressed CD73 and CD80 that produced antigen-specific antibodies in response to secondary infection. Re-challenge experiments indicated that IgG-producing cells dominated the recall response over the induction of IgM-secreting cells, with both populations expanding with similar timing during the secondary response. Furthermore, using ZsGreen1 expression as a surrogate for activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression alongside CD73 and CD80 co-expression, ZsGreen1+CD73+CD80+IgM+ MBCs gave rise to class-switched IgG-producing plasmablasts that induced comparable titers of Ag-specific Abs as their IgM- counterparts after adoptive transfer and infection with P. yoelii. Moreover, ZsGreen1+CD73+CD80+ IgM+ and IgM- MBCs differentiated into B cells with a germinal center phenotype after adoptive transfer. A third population of B cells (ZsGreen1-CD73-CD80-IgM-) that emerges after infection responded poorly to reactivation in vitro and in vivo, indicating that these cells do not represent a population of MBCs. Together these data indicated that MBC function is not defined by immunoglobulin isotype, nor does co-expression of key surface markers limit the potential fate of MBCs after recall.\n\nSummaryIgM+ and IgM- MBCs that co-express CD73 and CD80 can differentiate into plasmablasts and GC B cells after re-challenge with P. yoelii.",

    "preprint_abstract": "We analyzed a set of historical data from rapid vegetation inventories in a tropical montane cloud forest in northern Andean Ecuador. Trees in plots from several types of forest were counted and measured, including: (1) primary forest, including mature and recently closed-canopy sites and naturally formed gaps, (2) abandoned pasture, and (3) intensively-farmed sites. The goal of the study was to understand in a specific period of time the similarities and differences among natural and anthropogenic disturbances and their potential long term effect on the forest plant community. We found that mature and intermediate close canopy sites are similar. Also old forest is quite resilient to gap-forming disturbance. Natural gaps are quickly colonized by old-forest-associated plant species, and return to an old-forest-type community of trees in a short time. In contrast, forests regenerating from anthropogenic disturbance appear to have multiple possible states: some regenerating forest sites where the anthropogenic disturbance were low are coming to closely resemble old-forest-type communities, but some where the anthropogenic disturbance was intense appear to be changing in a very different direction, which does not resemble any other vegetation community type currently in the forest. A major predictor of present ecological state is the type of land use before reforestation: pastures can occasionally transition back to the pre-disturbance state of forest. More intensively used sites, many of which are abandoned sugar cane plantations, do not return to a pre-disturbance ecological state, instead forming a new and different kind of forest, dominated by a different community of trees. We examined tree-seedling communities to understand the trajectory of the forest into the future, and find that new forest types may be forming that do not resemble any existing associationsintensive agricultural sites. We also found that Los Cedros is extremely diverse in tree species. We estimate approximately 500 species of tree in only the small southeastern area of the reserve that has been explored scientifically. Additionally, the forest tree community shows extremely rapid distance decay (beta-diversity), approaching near complete turn-over in the limited spatial extent of the study. This suggests that hundreds of other tree species remain to be observed in the reserve, in addition to the 350+ that are directly observed in the present study, including new observations of species with IUCN threatened-endangered status. We also highlight the conservation value of Reserva Los Cedros, which has managed to reverse deforestation within its boundaries despite a general trend of extensive deforestation in the surrounding region, and to protect large, contiguous areas of highly-endangered Andean primary cloud forest habitat.",

In particular, the toxin-linked cryptic satellite phage (TLC{Phi}) plays an essential role in the continuous emergence of new toxigenic clones of the Vibrio cholerae strain at the origin of the ongoing 7th cholera pandemic. The Xer machinery is composed of two chromosomally-encoded tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD. They resolve chromosome dimers by adding a crossover between sister copies of a specific 28 base pair site of bacterial chromosomes, dif. The activity of XerD depends on a direct contact with a cell division protein, FtsK, which spatially and temporally constrains the process. TLC{Phi} encodes for a XerD-activation factor (XafT), which drives the integration of the phage into the dif site of the primary chromosome of V. cholerae independently of FtsK. However, XerD does not bind to the attachment site (attP) of TLC{Phi}, which raised questions on the integration process. Here, we compared the integration efficiency of thousands of synthetic mini-TLC{Phi} plasmids harbouring different attP sites and assessed their stability in vivo. In addition, we compared the efficiency with which XafT and the XerD activation domain of FtsK drive recombination reactions in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that XafT promotes the formation of synaptic complexes between canonical Xer recombination sites and imperfect sites.",

    "preprint_abstract": "DNA methylation, specifically, methylation of cytosine (C) nucleotides at the 5-carbon position (5-mC), is the most studied and among the most significant epigenetic modifications. Here we developed a chemoenzymatic procedure to fluorescently label non-methylated cytosines in the CpG context allowing epigenetic profiling of single DNA molecules spanning hundreds of thousands of base pairs. For this method, a CpG methyltransferase was used to transfer an azide to cytosines from a synthetic S-adenosyl-l-methionine cofactor analog. A fluorophore was then clicked onto the DNA, reporting on the amount and position of non-methylated CpGs. We found that labeling efficiency was increased two-fold by the addition of a nucleosidase that degrades the inactive by-product of the azide-cofactor after labeling, and prevents its inhibitory effect. We first used the method to determine the decline in global DNA methylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and then performed whole genome methylation mapping of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our genome maps show high concordance with published methylation maps produced by bisulfite sequencing. Although mapping resolution is limited by optical detection to 500-1000 base pairs, the labeled DNA molecules produced by this approach are hundreds of thousands of base pairs long, allowing access to long repetitive and structurally variable genomic regions.",

Recently, C/D snoRNAs were also implicated in regulating the expression of non-ribosomal genes through different modes of binding. Large scale RNA-RNA interaction datasets detect many snoRNAs binding messenger RNA, but are limited by specific experimental conditions. To enable a more comprehensive study of C/D snoRNA interactions, we created snoGloBe, a human C/D snoRNA interaction predictor based on a gradient boosting classifier. SnoGloBe considers the target type, position and sequence of the interactions, enabling it to outperform existing predictors. Interestingly, for specific snoRNAs, snoGloBe identifies strong enrichment of interactions near gene expression regulatory elements including splice sites. Abundance and splicing of predicted targets were altered upon the knockdown of their associated snoRNA. Strikingly, the predicted snoRNA interactions often overlap with the binding sites of functionally related RNA binding proteins, reinforcing their role in gene expression regulation. SnoGloBe is also an excellent tool for discovering viral RNA targets, as shown by its capacity to identify snoRNAs targeting the heavily methylated SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, snoGloBe is capable of identifying experimentally validated binding sites and predicting novel sites with shared regulatory function.",

Previously unreported strain variations were identified in the Ighm and Ighg2b genes, and analysis of VDJ rearrangements led to the inference of 278 germline IGHV alleles. 169 alleles are not present in the C57BL/6 genome reference sequence. To establish a set of expressed BALB/c IGHV germline gene sequences, we computationally retrieved IGHV haplotypes from the IgM dataset. Haplotyping led to the confirmation of 162 BALB/c IGHV gene sequences. A musIGHV398 pseudogene variant also appears to be present in the BALB/cByJ substrain, while a functional musIGHV398 gene is highly expressed in the BALB/cJ substrain. Only four of the BALB/c alleles were also observed in the C57BL/6 haplotype. The full set of inferred BALB/c sequences has been used to establish a BALB/c IGHV reference set, hosted at https://ogrdb.airr-community.org. We assessed whether assemblies from the Mouse Genome Project (MGP) are suitable for the determination of the genes of the IGH loci. Only 37 (43.5%) of the 85 confirmed IMGT-named BALB/c IGHV and 33 (42.9%) of the 77 confirmed non-IMGT IGHV were found in a search of the MGP BALB/cJ genome assembly.

Strikingly, although RNF219, inhibits the deadenylase activity of CCR4-NOT, it enhances its capacity to repress translation of a targeted mRNA, an effect of RNF219 that requires its interaction with CCR4-NOT.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundIt is expected that functional, mainly missense and loss-of-function (LOF), and regulatory variants are responsible for phenotypic differences among breeds, genetic lines, and varieties of livestock and crop species that have undergone diverse selection histories. However, there is still limited knowledge about the existing missense and LOF variation in livestock commercial populations, in particular regarding population-specific variation and how it can affect applications such as across-breed genomic prediction.\n\nMethodsWe re-sequenced the whole genome of 7,848 individuals from nine commercial pig breeding lines (average sequencing coverage: 4.1x) and imputed whole-genome genotypes for 440,610 pedigree-related individuals. The called variants were categorized according to predicted functional annotation (from LOF to intergenic) and prevalence level (number of lines in which the variant segregated; from private to widespread). Variants in each category were examined in terms of distribution along the genome, minor allele frequency, Wrights fixation index (FST), individual load, and association to production traits.\n\nResultsOf the 46 million called variants, 28% were private (called in only one line) and 21% were widespread (called in all nine lines). Genomic regions with low recombination rate were enriched with private variants. Low-prevalence variants (called in one or a few lines only) were enriched for lower allele frequencies, lower FST, and putatively functional and regulatory roles (including loss-of-function and deleterious missense variants). Only a small subset of low-prevalence variants was found at intermediate allele frequencies and had large estimated effects on production traits. Individuals on average carried less private deleterious missense alleles than expected compared to other predicted consequence types. A small subset of low-prevalence variants with intermediate allele frequencies and higher FST were detected as significantly associated to the production traits and explained small fractions of phenotypic variance (up to 3.2%). These associations were tagged by other more widespread variants, including intergenic variants.\n\nConclusionsMost low-prevalence variants are kept at very low allele frequency and only a small subset contributed detectable fractions of phenotypic variance. Not accounting for low-prevalence variants is therefore unlikely to hinder across-breed analyses, in particular for genomic prediction of breeding values using reference populations of a different genetic background.",

Sensitivity of individual-level data, ethical and practical considerations regarding data sharing across institutions could be a potential challenge for achieving this added power. Hence we implemented a federated meta-analysis approach of survival models in DataSHIELD, where only anonymous aggregated data are shared across institutions, while simultaneously allowing for exploratory, interactive modelling.\n\nIn this case, meta-analysis techniques to combine analysis results from each site are a solution, but an analytic workflow involving local analysis undertaken at individual studies hinders exploration. Thus, the aim is to provide a framework for performing meta-analysis of Cox regression models across institutions without manual analysis steps for the data providers.\n\nResultsWe introduce a package (dsSurvival) which allows privacy preserving meta-analysis of survival models, including the calculation of hazard ratios. Our tool can be of great use in biomedical research where there is a need for building survival models and there are privacy concerns about sharing data.",

This analysis yields time-varying selection gradients that clarify the influence of the fluctuations of the environment on the competitive ability of a specific life-history mutation. We use this framework to analyse the evolution of key life-history traits of pathogens. We examine three different epidemiological scenarios and we show how periodic fluctuations of the environment can affect the evolution of virulence and transmission as well as the preference for different hosts.

In addition, the DNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway, which was recently implicated in PD pathogenesis, is activated in these cells. This activation results from a combination of elevated mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol and a defect in the degradation of activated STING, a lysosome-dependent process.

In this work, we modelled a complete membrane-embedded SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the primary target of vaccine and therapeutics development, based on available structural data and known glycan content. We then used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the system in the presence of benzene probes designed to enhance discovery of cryptic, potentially druggable pockets on the S protein surface. We uncovered a novel cryptic pocket with promising druggable properties located underneath the 617-628 loop, which was shown to be involved in the formation of S protein multimers on the viral surface. A marked multi-conformational behaviour of this loop in simulations was validated using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, supportive of opening and closing dynamics. Interestingly, the pocket is also the site of the D614G mutation, known to be important for SARS-CoV-2 fitness, and within close proximity to mutations in the novel SARS-CoV-2 strains B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.28, both of which are associated with increased transmissibility and severity of infection. The pocket was present in systems emulating both immature and mature glycosylation states, suggesting its druggability may not be dependent upon the stage of virus maturation. Overall, the predominantly hydrophobic nature of the cryptic pocket, its well conserved surface, and proximity to regions of functional relevance in viral assembly and fitness are all promising indicators of its potential for therapeutic targeting. Our method also successfully recapitulated hydrophobic pockets in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain associated with detergent or lipid binding in prior cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. Collectively, this work highlights the utility of the benzene mapping approach in uncovering potential druggable sites on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 targets.",

Recently, it was discovered that the cell wall peptidorhamnomannan (PRM) of Sporothrix spp. is a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Interestingly, S. brasiliensis PRM has additional unknown rhamnose residues. We hypothesize that the structural differences of Sporothrix spp PRMs impact the hosts immune response and may explain the severity of sporotrichosis caused by S. brasiliensis. Here we demonstrate that S. brasiliensis yeasts and its PRM (S.b PRM) induced a strong inflammatory response in human PBMCs, with high production of TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1{beta} and induction of T-helper cytokines IFN-{gamma}, IL-17 and IL-22. In contrast, S. schenckii yeasts and its PRM induced higher concentrations of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which resulted in low production of T-helper cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22. CR3 and dectin-1 were required for cytokine induction by both PRMs, while TLR2 and TLR4 were required for the response of S.s PRM and S.b PRM, respectively. IL-1{beta} and IL-1 production induced by S. brasiliensis yeasts and S.b PRM were dependent on inflammasome and caspase-1 activation. S. schenckii and S.s PRM were able to induce IL-1{beta} independent of ROS. In conclusion, these findings improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of Sporothrix spp. by reporting differences of immunological responses induced by S. schenckii and S. brasiliensis. The study also opens the gateway for novel treatment strategies targeting local inflammation and tissue destruction induced by S. brasiliensis infection through IL-1 inhibition.",

All analyses are accompanied by example code to help researchers realize the potential of this method for the study of animal vocalizations.",

Current approaches to analyzing connectomes rely mainly on graph-theoretical tools, but these may downplay the complex nonlinear dynamics of single neurons and networks, and the way networks respond to their inputs. Here, we measure the functional similarity of simulated networks of neurons, by quantifying the similitude of their spiking patterns in response to the same stimuli. We find that common graph theory metrics convey little information about the similarity of networks responses. Instead, we learn a functional metric between networks based on their synaptic differences, and show that it accurately predicts the similarity of novel networks, for a wide range of stimuli. We then show that a sparse set of architectural features - the sum of synaptic inputs that each neuron receives and the sum of each neurons synaptic outputs - predicts the functional similarity of networks of up to 100 cells, with high accuracy. We thus suggest new architectural design principles that shape the function of neural networks, which conform with experimental evidence of homeostatic mechanisms.",

To identify redox vulnerabilities for KEAP1/NRF2 mutant NSCLC, we conducted a CRISPR-Cas9-based negative selection screen for antioxidant enzyme genes whose loss sensitized cells to sub-lethal concentrations of the superoxide (O2*-)-generating drug {beta}-Lapachone. While our screen identified expected hits in the pentose phosphate pathway, the thioredoxin-dependent antioxidant system, and glutathione reductase, we also identified the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) as one of the top hits. Surprisingly, {beta}-Lapachone did not generate mitochondrial O2*- but rather SOD2 loss enhanced the efficacy of {beta}-Lapachone due to loss of iron-sulfur protein function, loss of mitochondrial ATP maintenance and deficient NADPH production. Importantly, inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport activity sensitized to {beta}-Lapachone, demonstrating these effects may be translated to increase ROS sensitivity therapeutically.",

Indeed, some hallmarks of immune aging are more prevalent in individuals exposed to Whole-Body Irradiation (WBI). To test this hypothesis in a model relevant to human immune aging, we examined separate and joint effects of lifelong latent Murine Cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and early-life WBI (i) over the course of the lifespan; (ii) in response to a West Nile virus (WNV) live attenuated vaccine; and (iii) following lethal WNV challenge subsequent to vaccination. We recently published that a single dose of non-lethal WBI in youth, on its own, was not sufficient to accelerate aging of the murine immune system despite causing widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells. However, 4Gy sub-lethal WBI caused manifest reactivation of MCMV. Following vaccination and challenge with WNV in the old age, MCMV-infected animals experiencing 4Gy, but not lower, dose of sub-lethal WBI in youth had reduced survival. By contrast, old irradiated mice lacking MCMV and MCMV-infected, but not irradiated, mice were both protected to the same high level as the old non-irradiated, uninfected controls. Analysis of the quality and quantity of anti-WNV immunity showed that higher mortality in MCMV-positive WBI mice correlated with increased levels of MCMV-specific immune activation during WNV challenge. Moreover, we demonstrate that infection, including that by WNV, led to MCMV reactivation. Our data suggest that MCMV reactivation may be an important determinant of increased late-life mortality following early-life irradiation and late-life acute infection.",

While each of these traits is detrimental at the cellular level, it remains unclear how they are interconnected to cause systemic organ deterioration. Here we show that abrogating Brap, a BRCA1 associated protein important for neurogenesis, results in cellular senescence with persistent DNA double-strand breaks and elevation of histone H2A mono- and poly-ubiquitination (H2Aub). The high H2Aub initiates histone proteolysis, leading to both epigenetic alteration and proteasome overflow. These defects induce neuroinflammation, impair proteostasis, accelerate neurodegeneration, and substantially shorten lifespan in mice carrying Brap deletions in the brain. We further show H2Aub is also increased in human brain tissues of Alzheimers disease. These data together suggest that chromatin aberrations mediated by H2Aub act as a nexus of multiple aging hallmarks and promote tissue-wide degeneration.",

We have observed an increased phosphorylation of AKT1/mTOR/4EBP1 and levels of p21 in FOLFOX-resistant CRC cells. We have identified a small molecule, NSC49L, that stimulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, downregulates the AKT1/mTOR/4EBP1-axis, and inhibits p21 translation. We have provided evidence that NSC49L- and TRAIL-mediated sensitization is synergistically induced in p21-knockdown CRC cells, which is reversed in p21-overexpressing cells. p21 binds with procaspase 3 and prevents activation of caspase 3. We have shown that TRAIL induces apoptosis through the activation of caspase 3 by NSC49L-mediated downregulation of p21 translation, and thereby cleavage of procaspase 3 into caspase 3. NSC49L does not affect global protein synthesis. These studies provide a mechanistic understanding of NSC49L as a PP2A agonist, and how its combination with TRAIL sensitizes FOLFOX-resistant CRC cells.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/453259v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc3332org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c533b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4a852org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6aec2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Genome size and the correlated trait of cell size can influence these interactions through its effects on developmental rate and tissue geometry, ultimately driving the evolution of morphology. We tested the effects of genome size and body size evolution on heart and liver morphology using nine species of the salamander genus Plethodon (genome sizes 29.3-67 Gb). Our results show that whole organ size is determined by body size, whereas tissue structure changes dramatically with evolutionary increases in genome size. In the heart, increased genome size is correlated with a reduction of myocardia in the ventricle, yielding proportionally less force-producing mass and more empty space. In the liver, increased genome size is correlated with fewer and larger vascular structures, positioning hepatocytes farther from the circulatory vessels that transport key metabolites. Although these structural changes should have obvious impacts on organ function, their effects on organismal performance and fitness are likely negligible because low metabolic rates in salamanders relax selective pressure on key metabolic organ performance. Overall, this study reveals the effects of large genome and cell size on the developmental systems producing the heart and liver.",

Here we used a combination of approaches-- including neuroimaging assays of threat anticipation and emotional face perception and >10,000 momentary assessments of emotional experience--to demonstrate that individuals showing greater activation in a cingulo-opercular circuit during an anxiety-eliciting laboratory paradigm experience lower levels of stressor-dependent distress in their daily lives (n=202-208).

Here, we show that the fluorescence-activating and absorption-shifting tag (FAST) when complexed with the fluorogenic ligand 4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzylidene-rhodanine (HMBR) overcomes these issues and displays robust fluorescence in Methanococcus maripaludis. We also describe a mechanism to visualize cells under anoxic conditions using a fluorescence microscope. Derivatives of FAST were successfully applied for protein abundance analysis, subcellular localization, and determination of protein-protein interactions. FAST fusions to both formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) and F420-reducing hydrogenase (Fru) displayed increased fluorescence in cells grown on formate containing medium, consistent with previous studies suggesting increased abundance of these proteins in the absence of H2. Additionally, FAST fusions to both Fru and the ATPase associated with the archaellum (FlaI) showed membrane localization in single cells observed using anoxic fluorescence microscopy. Finally, a split reporter translationally fused to the alpha and beta subunits of Fdh reconstituted a functionally fluorescent molecule in vivo via bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Together, these observations demonstrate the utility of FAST as a tool for studying members of the methanogenic archaea.\n\nImportanceMethanogenic archaea are important members of anaerobic microbial communities where they catalyze essential reactions in the degradation of organic matter. Developing additional tools for studying the cell biology of these organisms is essential to understanding them at a mechanistic level.

    "preprint_abstract": "Climate change poses a threat to soil health and agriculture, but the potential effects of climate change on soil bacteria that can help maintain soil health are understudied. Rhizobia are a group of bacteria that increase soil nitrogen content through a symbiosis with legume plants. The soil and symbiosis are potentially stressful environments, and the soil will likely become even more stressful as the climate changes. Many rhizobia within the bradyrhizobia clade, like Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, possess the genetic capacity to synthesize hopanoids, steroid-like lipids similar in structure and function to cholesterol. Hopanoids are known to protect against stresses relevant to the niche of B. diazoefficiens. Paradoxically, mutants unable to synthesize the extended class of hopanoids participate in similarly successful symbioses compared to the wild type, despite being delayed in root nodule initiation. Here, we show that in B. diazoefficiens, the in vitro growth defects of extended hopanoid deficient mutants can be at least partially compensated for by the physicochemical environment, specifically by optimal osmotic and divalent cation concentrations. Through biophysical measurements, we show that extended hopanoids confer robustness to environmental variability. These results help explain the discrepancy between previous in vitro and in planta results and indicate that hopanoids may provide a greater fitness advantage to rhizobia in the variable soil environment than the more controlled environment within root nodules. To improve the legume-rhizobia symbiosis through either bioengineering or strain selection, it will be important to consider the full lifecycle of rhizobia, from the soil to the symbiosis.\n\nImportanceRhizobia, such as B. diazoefficiens, play an important role in the nitrogen cycle by making nitrogen gas bioavailable through symbiosis with legume plants. As climate change threatens soil health, this symbiosis has reentered the spotlight as a more sustainable source of soil nitrogen than the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Efforts to use rhizobia as biofertilizers have been effective; however, long term integration of rhizobia into the soil community has been less successful. This work represents a small step towards improving the legume-rhizobia symbiosis by identifying a cellular component--hopanoid lipids--that confers robustness to environmental stresses rhizobia are likely to encounter in soil microenvironments as sporadic desiccation and flooding events become more common.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a common commensal bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract as well as a frequent nosocomial pathogen. The secreted metalloprotease gelatinase (GelE) is an important E. faecalis virulence factor that contributes to numerous cellular activities such as autolysis, biofilm formation, and biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. Expression of gelE has been extensively studied and is regulated by the Fsr quorum-sensing system. Here, we identify two additional factors regulating gelatinase expression and activity in E. faecalis OG1RF. The Bph phosphatase is required for expression of gelE in an Fsr-dependent manner. Additionally, the membrane-anchored protein foldase PrsA is required for GelE activity, but not fsr or gelE gene expression. Disrupting prsA also leads to increased antibiotic sensitivity in biofilms independent of the loss of GelE activity. Together, our results expand the model for gelatinase production in E. faecalis, which has important implications for fundamental studies of GelE function in Enterococcus and also E. faecalis pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceIn Enterococcus faecalis, gelatinase (GelE) is a virulence factor that is also important for biofilm formation and interactions with other microbes as well as the host immune system. The long-standing model for GelE production is that the Fsr quorum sensing system positively regulates expression of gelE. Here, we update that model by identifying two additional factors that contribute to gelatinase production. The biofilm-associated Bph phosphatase regulates the expression of gelE through Fsr, and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PrsA is required for production of active GelE through an Fsr-independent mechanism. This provides important insight into how regulatory networks outside of the fsr locus coordinate expression of gelatinase.",

Furthermore, AK1 was enriched for tubular progenitor cells overexpressing profibrotic extracellular matrix genes. AK2, eight months after successful treatment of rejection, contained endothelial cells that expressed T-cell chemoattractant cytokines.

The approach is illustrated by coupling a model of the Ras-MAPK cascade to a model of the upstream activation of EGFR. Through this methodology, we aim to assist researchers and modellers in readily having access to more comprehensive biological systems models.\n\nAuthor summaryDetailed, multi-scale computational models bridging from biomolecular processes to entire organs and bodies have the potential to revolutionise medicine by enabling personalised treatments. One of the key challenges to achieving these models is connecting together the vast number of isolated biosimulation models into a coherent whole. Using recent advances in both modelling techniques and biological standards in the scientific community, we developed an approach to integrate and compose models in a physics-based environment. This provides significant advantages, including the automation of model composition and post-model-composition adjustments. We anticipate that our approach will enable the faster development of realistic and accurate models to understand complex biological systems.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Fear-based disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) steepen age-related cognitive decline and doubles the risk for developing Alzheimers disease. Due to the seemingly hyperactive properties of fear memories, PTSD symptoms can worsen with age. Perturbations in the synaptic circuitry supporting fear memory extinction are key neural substrates of PTSD. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a medial temporal lobe structure critical in the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of fear memories. As little is known about fear extinction memory and BLA synaptic dysfunction within the context of aging and AD, the goal of this study was to investigate how fear extinction memory deficits and basal amygdaloid nucleus (BA) synaptic dysfunction differentially associate in non-pathological aging and AD in the TgF344AD (TgAD) rat model of AD. Young, middle-aged, and older-aged WT and TgAD rats were trained on a delay fear conditioning and extinction procedure prior to ex vivo extracellular field potential recording experiments in the BA. Relative to young WT rats, long-term extinction memory was impaired, and in general, associated with a hyperexcitable BA and impaired LTP in TgAD rats at all ages. In contrast, long-term extinction memory was impaired in aged WT rats and associated with impaired LTP but not BA hyperexcitability. Interestingly, the middle-aged TgAD rats showed intact short-term extinction and BA LTP, suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, whereas differential neural recruitment in older-aged WT rats may have facilitated short-term extinction. As such, associations between fear extinction memory and amygdala deficits in non-pathological aging and AD are dissociable.\n\nSignificanceAdults with fear-based disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder are at an increased risk for developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimers disease (AD). Moreover, negative emotional affect is an early marker of AD. The link between fear-based disorders and AD creates a disadvantage for achieving positive outcomes later in life. Central to the circuitry underlying fear disorders are medial temporal lobe structures like the basal amygdaloid nucleus (BA). However, the role of the BA in fear-based disorders exacerbated by aging and AD is not well understood. Using the TgF344AD rat model of AD, we investigated how fear extinction memory impairments and BA synaptic function are impacted by aging and AD and whether these processes differentially associate in non-pathological aging and AD.",

One might expect that the processes of visual and haptic object recognition engage identical brain structures given the similarity of the problem and the advantages of avoiding redundant brain circuitry, but it has not yet been established the extent to which this is true. We recruited human participants to perform a one-back same-different visual and haptic shape comparison task both within (i.e., comparing two visual shapes or two haptic shapes) and across (i.e., comparing visual with haptic shapes) modalities. Participants saw or felt a shape and responded according to whether they thought the shape was the same or different from the previously felt or seen shape. We then used various shape metrics to predict performance based on the shape, orientation, and modality of the two stimuli which were being compared on each trial. We found that the fixed orientation of the shape stimuli was an important factor for predicting within-modal behavior, but the orientation of shapes compared across modality did not depend on knowing the presented orientation. We also found that the metrics which best predict shape comparison behavior heavily depended on the modality of the two shapes. We take these results as evidence that object recognition is not necessarily performed in a single, modality-agnostic region.",

Post-treatment of such an effluent prior to its applicability in irrigation can be of significant importance. In this study, the wastewater from a natural treatment plant was treated using a lab-scale filtration system with zeolite as a filter material. Three different column depths (0.5 m, 0.75 m, and 1 m) were used to investigate the effect of column depth on the treatment efficiency of the media. The suitability of the raw wastewater and the treated effluent from each column for irrigation purposes was investigated. The water quality parameters investigated were; electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+). From the analysis results, it was observed that the column depth had a significant influence on the removal efficiency of the pollutants. Where the removal efficiency was observed to be increasing with the increase in the column depth. The highest removal efficiency (94.58%) was achieved from the combination of electrical conductivity and 1 m column depth, while the lowest removal efficiency (10.05%) was observed from the combination of calcium and 0.5 m column depth. The raw wastewater fell mostly into a \"very high\" hazard, which is class four (C4) based on electrical conductivity and class four (S4) based sodium adsorption ratio; making it unsuitable for irrigation purposes. However, the status improved after the treatment using different column depths.",

Accordingly, recent modeling work indicates that stochastic processes, shaped by putative trade-offs between the cost and value of each connection, can successfully reproduce many topological properties of macroscale human connectomes measured with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Here, we derive a new formalism with the aim to more accurately capture the competing pressures of wiring cost minimization and topological complexity. We further show that model performance can be improved by accounting for developmental changes in brain geometry and associated wiring costs, and by using inter-regional transcriptional or microstructural similarity rather than topological wiring-rules. However, all models struggled to capture topologies spatial embedding. Our findings highlight an important role for genetics in shaping macroscale brain connectivity and indicate that stochastic models offer an incomplete account of connectome organization.",

In spite of this, the body of literature that accounts for the sex of participants in human locomotion studies is small and often produces controversial results. Here, we investigated the modular organization of muscle activation patterns for human locomotion using the concept of muscle synergies with a double purpose: i) uncover possible sex-specific characteristics of motor control and ii) assess whether these are maintained in older age. We recorded electromyographic activities from 13 ipsilateral muscles of the lower limb in young and older adults of both sexes walking (young and old) and running (young) on a treadmill. The data set obtained from the 215 participants was elaborated through non-negative matrix factorization to extract the time-independent (i.e., motor modules) and time-dependent (i.e., motor primitives) coefficients of muscle synergies. We found sparse sex-specific modulations of motor control. Motor modules showed a different contribution of hip extensors, knee extensors and foot dorsiflexors in various synergies. Motor primitives were wider (i.e., lasted longer) in males in the propulsion synergy for walking (but only in young and not in older adults) and in the weight acceptance synergy for running. Moreover, the complexity of motor primitives was similar in younger adults of both sexes, but lower in older females as compared to older males. In essence, our results revealed the existence of small but defined sex-specific differences in the way humans control locomotion and that these strategies are not entirely maintained in older age.",

Proteins that contain these domains, such as Tejas/Tapas in Drosophila, help localize Vasa to the germ granules and facilitate piRNA-mediated transposon silencing. The homologous proteins in mammals, TDRD5 and TDRD7, are required during spermiogenesis. Until now, proteins containing both LOTUS and Tudor domains in Caenorhabditis elegans have remained elusive. Here we describe LOTR-1 (D1081.7), which derives its name from its LOTUS and Tudor domains. Interestingly, LOTR-1 docks next to P granules to colocalize with the broadly conserved Z-granule helicase, ZNFX-1. LOTR-1s Z-granule association requires its Tudor domain, but both LOTUS and Tudor deletions affect brood size when coupled with a knockdown of the Vasa homolog glh-1. In addition to interacting with the germ-granule components WAGO-1, PRG-1 and DEPS-1, we identified a Tudor-dependent association with ZNFX-1. Like znfx-1 mutants, lotr-1 mutants lose small RNAs from the 3 ends of WAGO and Mutator targets, reminiscent of the loss of piRNAs from the 3 ends of piRNA precursor transcripts in mouse Tdrd5 mutants. Our work suggests that LOTR-1 acts in a conserved mechanism that brings small RNA generating mechanisms towards the 3 ends of small RNA templates or precursors.",

Small animal models have been used for studying OA progression mechanisms. However, numerical models to study cartilage responses under dynamic loading in preclinical animal models have not been developed. Here we present a musculoskeletal finite element (FE) model of a rat knee joint to evaluate cartilage biomechanical responses during a gait cycle. The rat knee joint geometries were obtained from a 3-D MRI dataset and the boundary conditions regarding loading in the joint were extracted from a musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb. The fibril-reinforced poroelastic (FRPE) properties of the rat cartilage were derived from data of mechanical indentation tests. Our numerical results showed the relevance of simulating anatomical and locomotion characteristics in the rat knee joint for estimating tissue responses such as contact pressures, stresses, strains, and fluid pressures. We found that the contact pressure and maximum principal strain were virtually constant in the medial compartment whereas they showed the highest values at the beginning of the gait cycle in the lateral compartment. Furthermore, we found that the maximum principal stress increased during the stance phase of gait, with the greatest values at midstance. We anticipate that our approach serves as a first step towards investigating the effects of gait abnormalities on the adaptation and degeneration of rat knee joint tissues and could be used to evaluate biomechanically-driven mechanisms of the progression of OA as a consequence of joint injury or obesity.\n\nAuthor SummaryOsteoarthritis is a disease of the musculoskeletal system which is characterized by the degradation of articular cartilage. Changes in the knee loading after injuries or obesity contribute to the development of cartilage degeneration. Since injured cartilage cannot be reversed back to intact conditions, small animal models have been widely used for investigating osteoarthritis progression mechanisms. Moreover, experimental studies have been complemented with numerical models to overcome inherent limitations such as cost, difficulties to obtain accurate measures and replicate degenerative situations in the knee joint. However, computational models to study articular cartilage responses under dynamic loading in small animal models have not been developed. Thus, here we present a musculoskeletal finite element model of a rat knee joint to evaluate cartilage biomechanical responses during gait. Our computational model considers both the anatomical and locomotion characteristics of the rat knee joint for estimating mechanical responses in the articular cartilage. We suggest that our approach can be used to investigate tissue adaptations based on the mechanobiological responses of the cartilage to prevent the progression of osteoarthritis.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), triggers enhanced accumulation of lipids to generate foamy macrophages (FMs). This process has been often attributed to the surge in the expression of lipid influx genes with a concomitant decrease in those involved in lipid efflux genes. Here, we define an Mtb-orchestrated modulation of the ubiquitination mechanism of lipid accumulation markers to enhance lipid accretion during infection. We find that Mtb infection represses the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, ITCH, resulting in the sustenance of key lipid accrual molecules viz. ADRP and CD36, that are otherwise targeted by ITCH for proteasomal degradation. In line, overexpressing ITCH in Mtb-infected cells was found to suppress Mtb-induced lipid accumulation. Molecular analyses including loss-of-function and ChIP assays demonstrated a role for the concerted action of the transcription factor YY1 and the arginine methyl transferase PRMT5 in restricting the expression of Itch gene by conferring repressive symmetrical H4R3me2 marks on its promoter. Consequently, siRNA-mediated depletion of YY1 or PRMT5 rescued ITCH expression, thereby compromising the levels of Mtb-induced ADRP and CD36 and limiting FM formation during infection. Accumulation of lipids within the host has been implicated as a pro-mycobacterial process that aids in pathogen persistence and dormancy. In our study, perturbation of PRMT5 enzyme activity resulted in compromised lipid levels and reduced mycobacterial survival in primary murine macrophages (ex vivo) and in a therapeutic mouse model of TB infection (in vivo). These findings provide new insights on the role of PRMT5 and YY1 in augmenting mycobacterial pathogenesis. Thus, we posit that our observations could help design novel adjunct therapies and combinatorial drug regimen for effective anti-TB strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryMycobacterium tuberculosis generates lipid-laden cells (foamy macrophages-FMs) that offer a favorable shelter for its persistence. During infection, we observe a significant reduction in the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, ITCH. This repression allows the sustenance of key lipid accretion molecules (ADRP and CD36), by curbing their proteasomal degradation. Further, we show the repression of ITCH to be dependent on the concerted action of the bifunctional transcription factor, YY1 and the arginine methyl transferase, PRMT5. NOTCH signaling pathway was identified as a master-regulator of YY1 expression. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed the significance of PRMT5 in regulating FM formation and consequently mycobacterial burden.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Engineered microbial cells present a sustainable alternative to fossil-based synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Cellular synthesis routes are readily assembled and introduced into microbial strains using state-of-the-art synthetic biology tools. However, the optimization of the strains required to reach industrially feasible production levels is far less efficient. It typically relies on trial-and-error leading into high uncertainty in total duration and cost. New techniques that can cope with the complexity and limited mechanistic knowledge of the cellular regulation are called for guiding the strain optimization.\n\nIn this paper, we put forward a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that learns from experiments to tune the metabolic enzyme levels so that the production is improved. Our method is model-free and does not assume prior knowledge of the microbes metabolic network or its regulation. The multi-agent approach is well-suited to make use of parallel experiments such as multi-well plates commonly used for screening microbial strains.\n\nWe demonstrate the methods capabilities using the genome-scale kinetic model of Escherichia coli, k-ecoli457, as a surrogate for an in vivo cell behaviour in cultivation experiments. We investigate the methods performance relevant for practical applicability in strain engineering i.e. the speed of convergence towards the optimum response, noise tolerance, and the statistical stability of the solutions found. We further evaluate the proposed MARL approach in improving L-tryptophan production by yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using publicly available experimental data on the performance of a combinatorial strain library.\n\nOverall, our results show that multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising approach for guiding the strain optimization beyond mechanistic knowledge, with the goal of faster and more reliably obtaining industrially attractive production levels.\n\nAuthor summaryEngineered microbial cells offer a sustainable alternative solution to chemical production from fossil resources. However, to make the chemical production using microbial cells economically feasible, they need to be substantially optimized. Due to the biological complexity, this optimization to reach sufficiently high production is typically a costly trial and error process.\n\nThis paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach to guide this task. Our tool learns a model from previous experiments and uses the model to suggest improvements to the engineering design, until a satisfactory production performance is reached. This paper evaluates the behaviour of the proposed AI method from several angles, including the amount of experiments needed, the tolerance to noise as well as the stability of the proposed designs.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Ecological memory refers to the influence of past events on the response of an ecosystem to exogenous or endogenous changes. Memory has been widely recognized as a key contributor to the dynamics of ecosystems and other complex systems, yet quantitative community models often ignore memory and its implications.\n\nRecent modeling studies have shown how interactions between community members can lead to the emergence of resilience and multistability under environmental perturbations. We demonstrate how memory can be introduced in such models using the framework of fractional calculus. We study how the outcomes of a well-characterized interaction model are affected by gradual increases in ecological memory under varying initial conditions, perturbations, and stochasticity.\n\nOur results highlight the implications of memory on several key aspects of community dynamics. In general, memory introduces inertia into the dynamics. This favors species coexistence under perturbation, enhances system resistance to state shifts, mitigates hysteresis, and can affect system resilience both ways depending on the time scale considered. Memory also promotes long transient dynamics, such as long-standing oscillations and delayed regime shifts, and contributes to the emergence and persistence of alternative stable states. Our study highlights the fundamental role of memory on ecological communities, and provides quantitative tools to introduce it in ecological models and analyse its impact under varying conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryAn ecosystem is said to exhibit ecological memory when its future states do not only depend on its current state but also on its initial state and trajectory. Memory may arise through various mechanisms as organisms adapt to their environment, modify it, and accumulate biotic and abiotic material. It may also emerge from phenotypic heterogeneity at the population level. Despite its commonness in nature, ecological memory and its potential influence on ecosystem dynamics have been so far overlooked in many applied contexts. Here, we use modeling to investigate how memory can influence the dynamics, composition, and stability landscape of ecological communities. We incorporate long-term memory effects into a multi-species model recently introduced to investigate alternative stable states in microbial communities. We assess the impact of memory on key aspects of model behavior and validate our findings using a model parameterized by empirical data from the human gut microbiota. Our approach for modeling memory and studying its implications has the potential to improve our understanding of microbial community dynamics and ultimately our ability to predict, manipulate, and experimentally design microbial ecosystems. It could also be applied more broadly in the study of systems composed of interacting components.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Despite the progress in prediction of protein complexes over the last decade, recent blind protein complex structure prediction challenges revealed limited success rates (less than 20% models with DockQ score > 0.4) on targets that exhibit significant conformational change upon binding. To overcome limitations in capturing backbone motions, we developed a new, aggressive sampling method that incorporates temperature replica exchange Monte Carlo (T-REMC) and conformational sampling techniques within docking protocols in Rosetta. Our method, ReplicaDock 2.0, mimics induced-fit mechanism of protein binding to sample backbone motions across putative interface residues on-the-fly, thereby recapitulating binding-partner induced conformational changes. Furthermore, ReplicaDock 2.0 clocks in at 150-500 CPU hours per target (protein-size dependent); a runtime that is significantly faster than Molecular Dynamics based approaches. For a benchmark set of 88 proteins with moderate to high flexibility (unbound-to-bound iRMSD over 1.2 [A]), ReplicaDock 2.0 successfully docks 61% of moderately flexible complexes and 35% of highly flexible complexes. Additionally, we demonstrate that by biasing backbone sampling particularly towards residues comprising flexible loops or hinge domains, highly flexible targets can be predicted to under 2 [A] accuracy. This indicates that additional gains are possible when mobile protein segments are known.\n\nSignificance StatementProteins bind each other in a highly specific and regulated manner, and these associated dynamics of binding are intimately linked to their function. Conventional techniques of structure determination such as cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography and NMR are time-consuming and arduous. Using a temperature-replica exchange Monte Carlo approach that mimics the kinetic mechanism of \"induced fit\" binding, we improved prediction of protein complex structures, particularly for targets that exhibit considerable conformational changes upon binding (Interface root mean square deviation (unbound-bound) > 1.2 [A]. Capturing these binding-induced conformational changes in proteins can aid us in better understanding biological mechanisms and suggest intervention strategies for disease mechanisms.",

Place cells have also been reported in the rat claustrum, an underexplored paracortical region with extensive corto-cortical connectivity. It has been hypothesised that claustral neuronal responses are anchored to cortical visual inputs. We show rat claustral place cells remap when visual inputs are eliminated from the environment and that this remapping is NMDA-receptor-dependent. Eliminating visual input enhances delta-band oscillatory activity in the claustrum, without affecting simultaneously-recorded visual cortical activity. We conclude that, like the hippocampus, claustral place field remapping might be mediated by NMDA receptor activity, and is modulated by visual cortical inputs. (106 words)",

We programmed interactive robot-controlled prey to flee from an approaching blue acara predator (Andinoacara pulcher), allowing us to manipulate the predictability of the preys initial escape direction. When repeatedly exposed to predictable prey, the predators adjusted their behaviour before the prey even began to escape: prey programmed to escape directly away were approached more rapidly than prey escaping at an acute angle. These faster approach speeds compensated for a longer time needed to capture such prey during the subsequent pursuit phase, and predators showed greater acceleration when pursuing unpredictable prey. Collectively, these behaviours resulted in the preys predictability having no net effect on the time to capture prey. Rather than minimising capture times, predators adjust their behaviour to maintain an adequate level of performance.",

It was posited that this CB-BG network provides support for cortical systems processing, spanning cognitive, emotional, and motor domains, implying subcortical network measures are strongly related to cortical network measures (Bostan & Strick, 2018); however, it is currently unknown how network measures within distinct CB-BG networks relate to cortical network measures. Here, 122 regions of interest comprising cognitive and motor CB-BG networks and 7 canonical cortical resting-state were used to investigate whether the integration (quantified using global efficiency, GE) of cognitive CB-BG network (CCBN) nodes and their segregation from motor CB-BG network (MCBN) nodes is related to cortical network GE and segregation in 233 non-related, right- handed participants (Human Connectome Project-1200). CCBN GE positively correlated with GE in the default mode, motor, and auditory networks and MCBN GE positively correlated with GE in all networks except the default mode and emotional. MCBN segregation was related to MN segregation. These findings highlight the CB-BG networks role in executive function, task switching, and verbal working memory. This work has implications for understanding cortical network organization and cortical-subcortical interactions in healthy adults and may help in deciphering subcortical differences seen in disease states.",

In salamanders, visually-guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labelled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labelled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.",

Mounting evidence causally links the SO to sleeps functions, and it has recently become possible to manipulate the SO non-invasively and phase-specifically. These developments represent promising clinical avenues, but they also highlight the importance of improving our understanding of how ON/OFF states affect incoming stimuli and what role they play in neuronal plasticity. Most studies using closed-loop stimulation rely on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) signals, which reflect neuronal ON and OFF states only indirectly. Here we develop an online detection algorithm based on spiking activity recorded from laminar arrays in mouse motor cortex. We find that online detection of ON and OFF states reflects specific phases of spontaneous LFP SO. Our neuronal-spiking-based closed-loop procedure offers a novel opportunity for testing the functional role of SO in sleep-related restorative processes and neural plasticity.",

This study aimed to understand the roles of molecules whose expression is affected by MTX in RA patients and find novel therapeutic targets.\n\nMethodsCD4+ T cells from 28 treatment naive RA patients before and 3 months after the initiation of MTX treatment were subjected to DNA microarray analyses. The expression of Semaphorin 3G (Sema3G), as one of the differentially-expressed genes, and its receptor, Neuropilin-2 (Nrp2), was evaluated in RA synovium and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) synovium. CIA and collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) were induced in Sema3G-deficient (Sema3G-/-) mice and control mice, and the clinical score, histological score, and serum cytokines were assessed. The migration and proliferation of Sema3G-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were analyzed in vitro. The effect of local Sema3G administration during CAIA on the clinical score and the quantity of infiltrating macrophages was evaluated.\n\nResultsThe expression of Sema3G in CD4+ T cells was downregulated by MTX treatment in RA patients. Sema3G was expressed in RA but not osteoarthritis synovium, and its receptor Nrp2 was mainly expressed on activated macrophages. Sema3G deficiency ameliorated CIA and CAIA. Sema3G stimulation enhanced the migration and proliferation of BMMs. The local administration of Sema3G deteriorated CAIA and increased infiltrating macrophages.\n\nConclusionsUpregulation of Sema3G in RA synovium is a novel mechanism to deteriorate joint inflammation through the accumulation of macrophages.\n\nKey messagesSemaphorin 3G is expressed in the inflamed synovium in human and mice.\n\nThe receptor of Semaphorin 3G is mainly expressed on M1 macrophages.\n\nSemaphorin 3G deteriorates inflammatory arthritis through macrophage proliferation and migration.",

Stimulation involved with CBI is often considered to be uncomfortable, and alternative ways to index connectivity between cerebellum and the cortex would be valuable. Utilising electroencephalography in conjunction with TMS (combined TMS-EEG) to record the response to CBI has the potential to achieve this, but has not been attempted previously.\n\nObjectiveTo investigate the utility of TMS-EEG for characterising cerebellar-cortical interactions recruited by CBI.\n\nMethodsA total of 33 volunteers (25.7 {+/-} 4.9 years, 20 females) participated across three experiments. These investigated EEG responses to CBI induced with a figure-of-eight (F8; experiment 1) or double cone (DC; experiment 2) conditioning coil over cerebellum, in addition to multisensory sham stimulation (experiment 3).\n\nResultsBoth F8 and DC coils suppressed early TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) produced by TMS to M1 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the TEP produced by CBI stimulation was related to the motor inhibitory response to CBI recorded in a hand muscle (P < 0.05), but only when using the DC coil. Multisensory sham stimulation failed to modify the M1 TEP.\n\nConclusionsCerebellar conditioning produced changes in the M1 TEP that were not apparent following sham stimulation, and that were related to the motor inhibitory effects of CBI. Our findings therefore suggest it is possible to index the response to CBI using TMS-EEG. In addition, while both F8 and DC coils appear to recruit cerebellar projections, the nature of these may be different.",

Using population genetic analyses, we investigated the demographic history, the contemporary genetic diversity and structure, and the occurrence of hybridization and introgression of two species of anadromous fish with contrasting life history strategies and which have undergone recent demographic declines, the allis shad (Alosa alosa) and the twaite shad (Alosa fallax). We genotyped 706 individuals from 20 rivers and 5 sites at sea in Southern Europe at thirteen microsatellite markers. Genetic structure between populations was lower for the nearly semelparous species A. alosa, which disperses greater distances compared to the iteroparous species, A. fallax. Individuals caught at sea were assigned at the river level for A. fallax and at the region level for A. alosa. Using an approximate Bayesian computation framework, we inferred that the most likely long term historical divergence scenario between both species and lineages involved historical separation followed by secondary contact accompanied by strong population size decline. Accordingly, we found evidence for contemporary hybridization and bidirectional introgression due to gene flow between both species and lineages. Moreover, our results support the existence of at least one distinct species in the Mediterrannean sea: A. agone in Golfe du Lion area, and another divergent lineage in Corsica. Overall, our results shed light on the interplay between historical and recent demographic processes and life history strategies in shaping population genetic diversity and structure of closely related species.

Here we introduce MiSSE, a trait-free, state-dependent speciation and extinction approach that can be used to estimate varying speciation, extinction, net-diversification, turnover rates, and extinction fraction at the tips of the tree. We compare the accuracy of tip rates inferred by MiSSE against similar methods and demonstrate that, due to certain characteristics of the model, the error is generally low across a broad range of speciation and extinction scenarios. MiSSE can be used alongside regular phylogenetic comparative methods in trait related diversification hypotheses, and we also describe a simple correction to avoid pseudoreplication from sister tips in analyses of independent contrasts. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of MiSSE, with a renewed focus on classic comparative methods, to examine correlation between plant height and turnover rates in eucalypts, a species-rich lineage of flowering plants.",

Surgical intervention remains standard care, since specific and efficient pharmacological treatment options are limited for pathologies with disturbed brain fluid homeostasis. Such lack of therapeutic targets originates, in part, from the incomplete map of the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion by the choroid plexus.\n\nMethodsThe transcriptomic profile of rat choroid plexus was generated by RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of whole tissue and epithelial cells captured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and compared to proximal tubules. The bioinformatic analysis comprised mapping to reference genome followed by filtering for type, location, and association with alias and protein function. The transporters and associated regulatory modules were arranged in discovery tables according to their transcriptional abundance and tied together in association network analysis.\n\nResultsThe transcriptomic profile of choroid plexus displays high similarity between sex and species (human, rat, and mouse) and lesser similarity to another secretory epithelium, the proximal tubules. The discovery tables provide lists of transport mechanisms that could participate in CSF secretion and suggest regulatory candidates.\n\nConclusionsWith quantification of the transport protein abundance in choroid plexus and their potentially linked regulatory modules, we envision a molecular tool to devise rational hypotheses regarding future delineation of choroidal transport proteins involved in CSF secretion and their regulation. Our vision is to obtain pharmaceutical targets towards modulation of CSF production in pathologies involving disturbed brain water dynamics.",

However, little is known about the consequences of somatic mutation accumulation for offspring fitness. We evaluate the fitness effects of somatic mutations in Mimulus guttatus by comparing progeny from self-pollinations made within the same flower (autogamy) to progeny from self-pollinations made between stems on the same plant (geitonogamy). The effects of somatic mutations are evident from this comparison, as autogamy leads to homozygosity of a proportion of somatic mutations, but progeny from geitonogamy remain heterozygous for mutations unique to each stem. In two different experiments, we find consistent fitness effects of somatic mutations from individual stems. Surprisingly, several progeny groups from autogamous crosses displayed increases in fitness compared to progeny from geitonogamy crosses, indicating that beneficial somatic mutations were prevalent in some stems. These results support the hypothesis that somatic mutations accumulate during vegetative growth, but they are filtered by different forms of selection that occur throughout development, resulting in the culling of expressed deleterious mutations and the retention of beneficial mutations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Interactions between physical forces and membrane proteins underpin many forms of environmental sensation and acclimation. Microbes survive sudden osmotic stresses with the help of mechanically gated ion channels and osmolyte transporters. Plant mechanosensitive ion channels have been shown to function in defense signaling. Here, we engineered genetically encoded osmolality sensors (OzTracs) by fusing green fluorescent protein spectral variants to the mechanosensitive ion channels MscL from E. coli or MSL10 from A. thaliana. When expressed in yeast cells, OzTrac sensors reported osmolality changes as a proportional change in emission ratio of the two fluorescent protein domains. Live-cell imaging revealed accumulation of fluorescent sensors in internal aggregates presumably derived from the endomembrane system. Thus, OzTrac sensors serve as osmolality-dependent reporters through an indirect mechanism, such as effects on molecular crowding or fluorophore solvation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Given the risk of Candida albicans overgrowth in the gut, novel complementary therapies should be developed to reduce fungal dominancy. This study highlights the antifungal characteristics of a Bacillus subtilis-derived secondary metabolite, surfactin with high potential against C. albicans. Surfactin inhibited the growth of C. albicans following a 1-hour exposure, in addition to reduced adhesion and morphogenesis. Specifically, surfactin did not affect the level of reactive oxygen species but increased the level of reduced glutathione. Surprisingly, ethanol production enhanced following 2 hours of surfactin exposure. Surfactin treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular iron, manganese and zinc content compared to control cells, whereas the level of copper was not affected. Alongside these physiological properties, surfactin also enhanced fluconazole efficacy. To gain detailed insights into the surfactin-related effects on C. albicans, genome-wide gene transcription analysis was performed. Surfactin treatment resulted in 1390 differentially expressed genes according to total transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Of these, 773 and 617 genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in transcription, respectively, were selected for detailed investigation. Several genes involved in morphogenesis or related to metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, fermentation, fatty acid biosynthesis) were down-regulated. Moreover, surfactin decreased the expression of ERG1, ERG3, ERG9, ERG10 and ERG11 involved in ergosterol synthesis, whereas genes associated with ribosome biogenesis and iron metabolism and drug transport-related genes were up-regulated. Our data demonstrate that surfactin significantly influences the physiology and gene transcription of C. albicans, and could contribute to the development of a novel innovative complementary therapy.\n\nImportanceAlthough gut colonization by Candida albicans can be considered normal, it may be associated with intestinal diseases. Furthermore, Candida dominance in the gut may pose a potent risk for systemic candidiasis, especially for immunocompromised individuals. In recent years, interest has been growing for the use of Bacillus subtilis as a safe and effective probiotic for human healthcare. Surfactin is a B. subtilis-derived lipopeptide with potential antifungal activity; however, the mechanism underlying this remains unknown. In this study, surfactin negatively affected the adherence, morphogenesis and metabolism of C. albicans and increased ethanol production. These were associated with a reduction in intracellular iron, manganese and zinc while the copper content was not affected. Alongside these physiological modulations, surfactin also had a potent synergistic effect on fluconazole. Our results provide a definitive explanation for the surfactin-related antifungal effect of B. subtilis; furthermore, these data provide a good basis for future probiotic development.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Bone regeneration in critical-sized defects is a clinical challenge, with biomaterials under constant development aiming at enhancing the natural bone healing process. The delivery of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in appropriate carriers represents a promising strategy for bone defect treatment but optimisation of the spatial-temporal release is still needed for the regeneration of bone with biological, structural, and mechanical properties comparable to the native tissue. Nonlinear micro finite element (FE) models can address some of these challenges by providing a tool able to predict the biomechanical strength and microdamage onset in newly formed bone when subjected to physiological or supraphysiological loads. Yet, these models need to be validated against experimental data. In this study, experimental local displacements in newly formed bone induced by osteoinductive biomaterials subjected to in situ X-ray computed tomography compression in the apparent elastic regime and measured using digital volume correlation (DVC) were used to validate FE models. Displacement predictions from homogeneous linear FE models were highly correlated to DVC-measured local displacements, while tissue heterogeneity capturing mineralisation differences showed negligible effects. Nonlinear FE models improved the correlation and showed that tissue microdamage occurs at low apparent strains. Microdamage seemed to occur next to large cavities or in biomaterial-induced thin trabeculae, independent of the mineralisation. While localisation of plastic strain accumulation was similar, the amount of damage accumulated in these locations was slightly higher when including material heterogeneity. These results demonstrate the ability of the nonlinear FE model to capture local microdamage in newly formed bone tissue and can be exploited to improve the current understanding of healing bone and mechanical competence. This will ultimately aid the development of BMPs delivery systems for bone defect treatment able to regenerate bone with optimal biological, mechanical, and structural properties.",

Region of interest (ROI)-specific cortical thickness and volume measures were extracted using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas. Cognitive reserve was quantified by residuals which subtract the predicted memory from the true memory. Cascade neural network (CNN) models were used to train RANN dataset for memory prediction. Transfer learning was applied to transfer the T1 imaging-based model from source domain (using RANN) to the target domain (HCPA or ADNI).\n\nThe CNN model trained on the RANN dataset exhibited strong linear correlation between true and predicted memory based on the chosen T1 cortical thickness and volume predictors. In addition, the model generated from healthy lifespan data (RANN) was able to generalize to an independent healthy lifespan data (HCPA) and older demented participants (ADNI) across different scanner types. The estimated CR was correlated with CR proxies such education and IQ across all three datasets.\n\nThe current findings suggest that the transfer learning approach is an effective way to generalize the residual-based CR estimation.

We show here that the native activity of CRISPR-Cas12c protects bacteria from phage infection by binding to DNA targets without cleaving them, revealing that antiviral interference can be accomplished without chemical attack on the invader or general metabolic disruption in the host. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that Cas12c is a site-specific ribonuclease capable of generating mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from precursor transcripts. Furthermore, we find that crRNA maturation is essential for Cas12c-mediated DNA targeting. Surprisingly, however, these crRNAs direct double-stranded DNA binding by Cas12c using a mechanism that precludes DNA cutting. Cas12cs RNA-guided DNA binding activity enables robust transcriptional repression of fluorescent reporter proteins in cells. Furthermore, this naturally DNase-free Cas12c enzyme can protect bacteria from lytic bacteriophage infection when targeting an essential phage gene. Together these results show that Cas12c employs targeted DNA binding to provide anti-viral immunity in bacteria, providing a native DNase-free pathway for transient antiviral immunity.",

However, it also serves as precursor for more deleterious species such as the hydroxyl anion or peroxynitrite and therefore, cellular defense mechanisms for superoxide neutralization have evolved. In addition to the soluble proteins superoxide dismutase and superoxide reductase, recently the membrane embedded diheme cytochrome b561(CybB) from E. coli has been proposed to act as a superoxide:quinone oxidoreductase. Here, we confirm superoxide and cellular ubiquinones or menaquinones as natural substrates and show that quinone binding to the enzyme accelerates the reaction with superoxide. The reactivity of the substrates is in accordance with the here determined midpoint potential of the two b hemes (+48 and -23 mV / NHE). Our data suggest that the enzyme can work near the diffusion limit in the forward direction and can also catalyse the reverse reaction efficiently under physiological conditions.

A growing number of studies have demonstrated that neural stemness is the source of the two cell properties, because neural stem cells and cancer cells share cell features and regulatory networks and neural stemness has an evolutionary advantage. However, it needs to validate whether neural stemness is a cell property that would unify tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential. SETDB1/Setdb1 is an epigenetic factor that is upregulated in cancer cells and promotes cancers, and correspondingly, is enriched in embryonic neural cells during vertebrate embryogenesis. We show that knockdown of SETDB1/Setdb1 led to neuronal differentiation in neural stem and cancer cells, concomitant with reduced tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential in these cells; whereas overexpression caused an opposite effect. On one hand, SETDB1 maintains a regulatory network comprised of proteins involved in developmental programs and basic cellular functional machineries, including epigenetic modifications (EZH2), ribosome biogenesis (RPS3), translation initiation (EIF4G), spliceosome assembly (SF3B1), etc., all of which play active roles in cancers. On the other, it represses transcription of genes promoting differentiation and cell cycle and growth arrest. Moreover, neural stemness, tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential were simultaneously enhanced during serial transplantation of cancer cells. Expression of proteins involved in developmental programs and basic cellular functional machineries, including SETDB1 and other proteins above, was gradually increased. In agreement with increased expression of spliceosome proteins, alternative splicing events also increased in tumor cells derived from later transplantations, suggesting that different machineries should work concertedly to match the status of high proliferation and pluripotent differentiation potential. The study presents the evidence that neural stemness unifies tumorigenicity and differentiation potential. Tumorigenesis represents a process of gradual loss of original cell identity and gain of neural stemness in somatic cells, which might be a distorted replay of neural induction during normal embryogenesis.",

We confirmed that four G-quartets were necessary for folding at sub-mM concentrations of potassium and found that the wrong choice of sequence for the linker between G-tracts could dramatically disrupt folding, presumably due to the presence of kinetic traps in the folding landscape. In the case of the triplex nanoswitch we examined, we found that the UV spectrum showed a small change in absorbance when a triplex was formed.

Studies examining (neuro-)computational mechanisms underlying choice behaviour typically focus on participants decisions. However, there is increasing evidence that option valuation might also be reflected in motor response vigour and eye movements, implicit measures of subjective utility.\n\nTo examine motor response vigour and visual fixation correlates of option valuation in intertemporal choice, we set up a task where the participants selected an option by pressing a grip force transducer, simultaneously tracking fixation shifts between options. As outlined in our preregistration (https://osf.io/k6jct), we used hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model the choices assuming hyperbolic discounting, compared variants of the softmax and drift diffusion model, and assessed the relationship between response vigour and the estimated model parameters.\n\nThe behavioural data were best explained by a drift diffusion model specifying a non-linear scaling of the drift rate by the subjective value differences. Replicating previous findings (Green et al., 1997; Wagner et al., 2020), we found a magnitude effect for temporal discounting, such that higher rewards were discounted less. This magnitude effect was further reflected in response vigour, such that stronger forces were exerted in the high vs. the low magnitude condition. Bayesian hierarchical linear regression further revealed higher grip forces, faster response times and a lower number of fixation shifts for trials with higher subjective value differences.\n\nOur data suggest that subjective utility or implicit valuation is reflected in response vigour during intertemporal choice. Taking into account response vigour might thus provide deeper insight into decision-making, reward valuation and maladaptive changes in these processes, e.g. in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

We use a newly-created line combining the msh1 mutant with mitochondrially-targeted GFP, and characterise mitochondrial dynamics with a combination of single-cell timelapse microscopy, computational tracking and network analysis. The collective physical behaviour of msh1 mitochondria is altered from wildtype in several ways: mitochondria become less evenly spread, and networks of inter-mitochondrial encounters become more connected with greater potential efficiency for inter-organelle exchange.

Importantly, this suggests that these standardized metrics can likely be directly compared between scenarios and individuals, with DV200 having an inflection point at [~]28 hrs.

Although investigated for decades, the underlying molecular mechanisms of transport and specificity remain elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological data on reconstituted Pdr5 demonstrating that this MDR efflux pump does not only actively translocate its substrates across the lipid bilayer, but generates a proton motif force in the presence of Mg2+-ATP and substrates by acting as a proton/drug co-transporter. Importantly, a strictly substrate dependent co-transport of protons was also observed in in vitro transport studies using Pdr5-enriched plasma membranes. Similar observations have not yet been reported for any other MDR efflux pump. We conclude from these results that the mechanism of MDR conferred by Pdr5 and likely other transporters is more complex than the sole extrusion of cytotoxic compounds and involves secondary coupled processes suitable to increase the effectiveness.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The lung epithelial barrier serves as a guardian towards environmental insults and responds to allergen encounter with a cascade of immune reactions that can possibly lead to inflammation. Whether the environmental sensor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) together with its downstream targets cytochrome P450 (CYP1) family members contribute to the regulation of allergic airway inflammation remains unexplored. By employing knockout mice for AhR and for single CYP1 family members, we found that AhR-/- and CYP1B1-/- but not CYP1A1-/- or CYP1A2-/- animals display enhanced allergic airway inflammation compared to WT. Expression analysis, immunofluorescence staining of murine and human lung sections and bone marrow chimeras suggest an important role of CYP1B1 in non-hematopoietic lung epithelial cells to prevent exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation. Transcriptional analysis of murine and human lung epithelial cells indicates a functional link of AhR to barrier protection/inflammatory mediator signaling upon allergen challenge. In contrast, CYP1B1 deficiency leads to enhanced expression and activity of CYP1A1 in lung epithelial cells and to an increased availability of the AhR ligand kynurenic acid following allergen challenge. Thus, differential CYP1 family member expression and signaling via the AhR in epithelial cells represents an immunoregulatory layer protecting the lung from exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation.",

APEC is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity associated with significant economic losses in the poultry industry.\n\nObjectiveThis study was aimed to determine the genomic diversity, virulence factor genes (VFGs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the APEC isolated from layer chickens using whole-genome sequencing (WGS).\n\nMethodAPEC MTR_BAU02 strain was isolated from the sick and dead birds. Genomic DNA from APEC MTR_BAU02 strain was extracted using commercial DNA extraction kit, WGS libraries were prepared using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit, and finally, paired-end (2 x 250) WGS performed using Illumina MiSeq sequencer.\n\nResultsThe genome size of strain APEC MTR_BAU02 is 4,924,680 bp with a GC content of 51.1% and 4,681 protein-coding sequences. Among the annotated WGS reads, 99.71% reads mapped to Enterobacteriaceae genomes. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the APEC MTR_BAU02 genome and 99 reference genomes of E. coli, the APEC MTR_BAU02 genome showed sequence similarities with enterotoxigenic E. coli strains isolated from infections of different clinical severity. Metabolic functional annotations detected 380 SEED subsystems including genes coding for carbohydrate metabolism (17.34%), amino acid and derivatives (14.20%), protein metabolism (10.64%), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments (7.49%), respiration (4.72%), membrane transport (4.49%), stress response (4.47%), motility and chemotaxis (4.46%), and virulence, disease and defense (2.22%). We also detected 92 VFGs and 122 AMR genes in the APEC MTR_BAU02 strain.\n\nConclusionAssessment of these genomic features with functional genomic validation in commonly occurring serogroups of APEC will increase our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, pave the way to early diagnosis and more effective control of colibacillosis, and improved animal welfare.",

Although less well characterized, the microtubule cytoskeleton also undergoes dramatic rearrangement during myogenesis. The centrosome-nucleated microtubule array found in myoblasts is lost as the nuclear membrane acquires microtubule nucleating activity and microtubules emerge from multiple sites in the cell, eventually rearranging into a grid-like pattern in myotubes. In order to characterize perinuclear microtubule organization using a biochemically tractable system, we isolated nuclei from mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle cells during the course of differentiation and incubated them in cytoplasmic extracts prepared from eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis. Whereas centrosomes associated with myoblast nuclei gave rise to radial microtubule arrays in extracts, myotube nuclei produced a sun-like pattern with microtubules transiently nucleating from the entire nuclear envelope. Perinuclear microtubule growth was suppressed by inhibition of Aurora A kinase or by degradation of RNA, treatments that also inhibited microtubule growth from sperm centrosomes. Myotube nuclei displayed microtubule motor-based movements leading to their separation, as occurs in myotubes. This in vitro assay therefore recapitulates key features of microtubule organization and nuclear movement observed during muscle cell differentiation.",

In 2015, L. sativae arrived on the Australian mainland and established on the Cape York Peninsula in the northeast of the country. Here, we assessed genetic variation in L. sativae based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated by double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) to uncover the potential origin(s) of this pest in Australia and contribute to reconstructing its global invasion history. Our principal component analyses (PCA) results suggested that Australian mainland populations were genetically close to populations from the Torres Strait and had connections to Bali and Papua New Guinea (PNG), whereas populations from Asia and Africa were more distantly related. Hawaii was genetically distinct from populations from Asia, Africa and Australia. Co-ancestry analyses pointed to signals of gene flow from the Torres Strait into the Australian mainland, while Indonesia/PNG were the likely sources of the initial invasion into the Torres Strait. Admixture analyses further revealed that L. sativae from the Torres Strait had genetic diversity originating from multiple sources, which has now spread to the Australian mainland. The L. sativae lineages from Asia/Africa appear closely related and may share co-ancestry. Isolation by distance (IBD) was found at a broad global scale, but not within small regions, suggesting human-mediated factors contribute to the local spread of this pest. Overall, our findings highlight the challenges in quarantine measures aimed at restricting the distribution of this global pest.",

Modern data-driven research has the power to promote novel biomedical discoveries through secondary analysis of such data. Therefore, it is important to ensure data-driven research with great reproducibility and robustness for promoting a precise and accurate secondary analysis of the immunogenomics data. In scientific research, rigorous conduct in designing and conducting experiments is needed, specifically in scientific and articulate writing, reporting and interpreting results. It is also crucial to make raw data available, discoverable, and well described or annotated in order to promote future re-analysis of the data. In order to assess the data availability of published T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data, we examined 11,918 TCR-Seq samples corresponding to 134 TCR-Seq studies ranging from 2006 to 2022. Among the 134 studies, only 38.1% had publicly available raw TCR-Seq data shared in public repositories. We also found a statistically significant association between the presence of data availability statements and the increase in raw data availability (p=0.014). Yet, 46.8% of studies with data availability statements failed to share the raw TCR-Seq data. There is a pressing need for the biomedical community to increase awareness of the importance of promoting raw data availability in scientific research and take immediate action to improve its raw data availability enabling cost-effective secondary analysis of existing immunogenomics data by the larger scientific community.",

A feature of many cerebellar ataxias is aberrant cerebellar output that contributes to motor dysfunction. We examined whether abnormal cerebellar output was present in the CMVMJD135 SCA3 mouse model and, if so, whether it correlated with the disease onset and progression. In vivo recordings showed that the activity of deep cerebellar nuclei neurons, the main output of the cerebellum, was altered. The aberrant activity correlated with the onset of ataxia. However, although the severity of ataxia increased with age, the severity of the aberrant cerebellar output was not progressive. The abnormal cerebellar output, however, was accompanied with non-progressive abnormal activity of their upstream synaptic inputs, the Purkinje cells. In vitro recordings indicated that alterations in both intrinsic Purkinje cell pacemaking and in their synaptic inputs contributed to abnormal Purkinje cell activity. These findings implicate abnormal cerebellar physiology as an early, consistent contributor to pathophysiology in SCA3, and suggest that the aberrant cerebellar output could be an appropriate therapeutic target in SCA3.\n\nSummary StatementIn a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 aberrant cerebellar physiology is apparent early in disease, before overt neuronal pathology or neuronal death.",

Elucidating this process is important both for fundamental research and assisted reproductive technology. However, only few computational tools, based on non-invasive measurements, are currently available to characterize oocyte meiotic maturation. Here, we develop a computational framework to phenotype oocytes based on images or movies acquired exclusively in transmitted light. We first trained neural networks to segment the contours of oocytes and their zona pellucida using a diverse cohort of both mouse and human oocytes. We then defined a comprehensive set of morphological features to describe a single oocyte. We have implemented these steps in a versatile and user-friendly open source Fiji plugin available to the mouse and human oocyte community. Then, we present a machine learning pipeline based on selected features to automatically recognize oocyte populations and determine their morphological differences. Its first application is a novel approach to screen oocyte strains and automatically identify their morphological characteristics. We demonstrate its potential by phenotyping a well characterized genetically modified mouse oocyte strain. Its second application is to predict and characterize the maturation potential of oocytes. Importantly, we identify two new features to assess mouse oocyte maturation potential, consisting in the texture of the zona pellucida and the cytoplasmic particles size. Eventually, we tested whether these mouse oocyte quality features were applicable to human oocytes developmental potential.",

However, our understanding of cell size control remains limited, due in large part to the challenges associated with accurate determination of cell volume. Much of our comprehension of size regulation derives from models such as budding and fission yeast, but even for these morphologically stereotypical cells, assessment of cell volume has relied on proxies and extrapolations from two-dimensional measurements. Recently, the fluorescence exclusion method (FXm) was developed to evaluate the size of mammalian cells, but whether it could be applied to smaller cells remained unknown. Using specifically designed microfluidic chips and an improved data analysis pipeline, we show here that FXm reliably detects subtle difference in the volume of fission yeast cells, even for those with altered shapes. Moreover, it allows for the monitoring of dynamic volume changes at the single-cell level with high time resolution. Collectively, our work reveals how coupling FXm with yeast genetics will bring new insights into the complex biology of cell growth.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTFluorescence exclusion provides a unique method to accurately measure the volume of yeast cells at both the population and single-cell levels.",

In some cases, performance clearly declines whereas in others compensatory mechanisms maintain performance even under dual-task conditions. This study set out to investigate the preliminary finding of behavioral improvement in Go-NoGo response inhibition task performance during walking compared to sitting, which was observed at the piloting stage. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) was used to record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, three-dimensional (3D) gait kinematics and behavioral responses in the cognitive task, during sitting or walking on a treadmill. In a cohort of twenty-six (26) young adults, fourteen (14) participants improved in measures of cognitive task performance while walking compared to sitting. These participants exhibited walking-related EEG amplitude reductions over frontal brain scalp regions during key stages of inhibitory control (conflict monitoring, control implementation and pre-motor stages), accompanied by reduced stride-to-stride variability and faster responses to stimuli compared to those who did not improve. In contrast, the twelve (12) participants who did not improve exhibited no EEG amplitude differences across physical condition. The neural activity changes associated with performance improvement during dual tasking hold promise as cognitive flexibility markers that can potentially help assess cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration.",

TPD52 directly interacts with AMPK and inhibits AMPK kinase activity in vitro and in vivo.

Drosophila Pericentrin (PCNT)-like protein (PLP) is a key centrosome component that directs formation of a pericentriolar material (PCM) scaffold required for PCM organization and MTOC function. Here, we investigate the post-transcriptional regulation of plp mRNA. We identify conserved binding sites for cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) proteins within the plp 3-untranslated region and examine the role of the CPEB ortholog, oo18 RNA-binding protein (Orb), in plp mRNA regulation. Our data show Orb biochemically interacts with plp mRNA and promotes PLP protein expression. Loss of orb, but not orb2, diminishes PLP levels in embryonic extracts. Consequently, PLP localization to centrosomes and function in PCM scaffolding is compromised in orb mutant embryos, resulting in genome instability and embryonic lethality. Moreover, we find PLP over-expression can restore centrosome scaffolding and rescue the cell division defects caused by orb depletion. Our data suggest Orb modulates PLP expression at the level of plp mRNA polyadenylation and showcases the post-transcriptional regulation of core, conserved centrosomal mRNAs as critical for centrosome function.",

We show that NTC is a two-stage process and that CE and AC do not overlap temporally while their spatial activity is distinct. PCP driven CE is restricted to the caudal part of the neural plate (NP) and takes place during the first stage. CE is essential for correct positioning of the NP rostral most region in the midline of the dorsoventral axis. AC occurs after CE throughout the NP and is the sole contributor of anterior NTC. We go on to show that the SE is mechanically coupled with the NP providing resistive forces during NTC. Its movement towards the midline is passive and driven by forces generated through NP morphogenesis. Last, we show that increase of SE resistive forces is detrimental for NP morphogenesis, showing that correct SE development is permissive for NTC.",

Organoids can be used as models for drug discovery and are being explored to guide clinical decision making. Patient derived organoids can have heterogeneous morphologies with unclear biological causes and relationship to treatment response. Here, we used high-throughput, image-based profiling to quantify phenotypes of over 5 million individual colorectal cancer organoids after treatment with more than 500 small molecules. Integration of data using a joint multi-omics modelling framework identified organoid size and cystic vs. solid organoid architecture as axes of morphological variation across organoids. Mechanistically, we found that organoid size was linked to IGF1 receptor signaling, while a cystic organoid architecture was associated with an LGR5+ stemness program. Treatment-induced organoid morphology reflected organoid viability, drug mechanism of action, and was biologically interpretable using joint modelling. Inhibition of MEK led to cystic reorganization of organoids and increased expression of LGR5, while inhibition of mTOR induced IGF1 receptor signaling. In conclusion, we identified shared axes of variation for colorectal cancer organoid morphology, their underlying biological mechanisms, and pharmacological interventions with the ability to move organoids along them. Image-based profiling of patient derived organoids coupled with multi-omics integration facilitates drug discovery by linking drug responses with underlying biological mechanisms.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Constantly in flux, low-molecular-weight organic substances (LMWOSs) are at the nexus between microorganisms, plant roots, detritus, and the soil mineral matrix. Nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) has been put forward as one way to parameterize microbial uptake rates of LMWOSs and efficiency of carbon incorporation into new biomass. In this study, we employed an ecophysiological approach to test these proposed relationships using targeted exometabolomics (1H-NMR, HR-LCMS) coupled with stable isotope (13C) probing. We assessed the role of compound class and oxidation state on uptake kinetics and substrate-specific carbon use efficiency (SUE) during the growth of three model soil microorganisms (Penicillium spinulosum, Paraburkholderia solitsugae, and Ralstonia pickettii) in media containing 34 common LMWOSs. Microbial isolates were chosen to span a gradient in growth rate (0.046-0.316 hr-1) and differ phylogenetically (a fungal isolate and two bacterial isolates). Clustered, co-utilization of LMWOSs occured for all three organisms, but temporal cluster separation was most apparent for P. solitsugae. Potential trends (p <0.05) for early utilization of more oxidized substrates were present for the two bacterial isolates (P. solitsugae and R. pickettii), but high variability (R2 > 0.15) and a small effect of NOSC indicate these are not useful relationships for prediction. The SUEs ranged from 0.16-0.99 and the hypothesized inverse relationship between NOSC and SUE was not observed. Thus, our results do not provide compelling support for NOSC as a predictive tool, implying that metabolic strategies of organisms may be more important than chemical identity in determining LMWOS cycling in soils.\n\nImportanceCommunity-level observations from soils indicate that low-molecular-weight compounds of higher oxidation state tend to be depleted from soil solution faster and incorporated less efficiently into microbial biomass under oxic conditions. Here, we tested hypothetical relationships between substrate chemical characteristics and the order of substrate utilization by aerobic heterotrophs at the population-level in culture, using two bacterial isolates (Ralstonia pickettii and Paraburkholderia solitsugae) and one fungal isolate from soil (Penicillium spinulosum). We found weak relationships indicating earlier uptake of more oxidized substrates by the two bacterial isolates but no relationship for the fungal isolate. We found no relationship between substrate identity and substrate use efficiency. Our findings indicate that substrate chemical characteristics have limited utility for modeling the depletion of low-molecular-weight organics from soil solution and incorporation into biomass over broader phylogenetic gradients.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a technique commonly used both in clinical and fundamental neurosciences. Classically, brain stimulation requires an implanted and wired electrode system to deliver stimulation directly to the target area. Although techniques such as temporal interference (TI) can provide stimulation at depth without involving any implanted electrodes, these methods still rely on a wired apparatus which limits free movement. Herein we report organic photocapacitors as untethered light-driven electrodes which convert deep-red light into electric current. Pairs of these ultrathin devices can be driven using lasers at two different frequencies to deliver stimulation at depth via temporally interfering fields. We validate this concept of laser TI stimulation using numerical modeling, ex vivo tests with phantom samples, and finally in vivo tests. Wireless organic photocapacitors are placed on the cortex and elicit stimulation in the hippocampus, while not delivering off-target stimulation in the cortex. This laser-driven wireless TI evoked a neuronal response at depth that is comparable to control experiments induced with deep brain stimulation protocols using implanted electrodes. Our work shows that a combination of these two techniques - temporal interference and organic electrolytic photocapacitors - provides a reliable way to target brain structures requiring neither deeply implanted electrodes nor tethered stimulator devices. The laser TI protocol demonstrated here address two of the most important drawbacks in the field of deep brain stimulation and thus holds potential to solve many issues in freely-moving animal experiments or for clinical chronic therapy application.",

Small molecules offer opportunities to both decode these cellular roles and develop therapeutics, yet there are few examples of small molecules that target biologically relevant RNA tertiary structures. While RNA triple helices are a particular attractive target, discovery of triple helix modulators has been hindered by the lack of correlation between small molecule affinity and effect on structural modulation, thereby limiting the utility of affinity-based screening as a primary filtering method. To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput RT-qPCR screening platform that reports on the effect of mutations and additives, such as small molecules, on the structuredness of triple helices. Using the 3-end of the oncogenic non-coding RNA MALAT1 as an example, we demonstrated the applicability of both a two-step and a one-pot method to assess the impact of mutations and small molecules on the stability of the triple helix. Employment of a functional high-throughput assay as a primary screen will significantly expedite the discovery of probes that modulate RNA triple helices structural landscape and, consequently, help gain insight into the roles of these pervasive structures.",

Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of acoustic detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in left prefrontal cortex than listeners with normal hearing, specifically in a region engaged in a separate spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment of left prefrontal cortex.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe variation in the pathogen type as well as the spatial heterogeneity of predictors make the generality of any associations with pathogen discovery debatable. Our previous work confirmed that the association of a group of predictors differed across different types of RNA viruses, yet there have been no previous comparisons of the specific predictors for RNA virus discovery in different regions. The aim of the current study was to close the gap by investigating whether predictors of discovery rates within three regions--the United States, China and Africa--differ from one another and from those at the global level.\n\nMethodsBased on a comprehensive list of human-infective RNA viruses, we collated published data on first discovery of each species in each region. We used a Poisson boosted regression tree (BRT) model to examine the relationship between virus discovery and 33 predictors representing climate, socio-economics, land use, and biodiversity across each region separately. The discovery probability in three regions in 2010-2019 was mapped using the fitted models and historical predictors.\n\nResultsThe numbers of human-infective virus species discovered in the United States, China and Africa up to 2019 were 95, 80 and 107 respectively, with China lagging behind the other two regions. In each region, discoveries were clustered in hotspots. BRT modelling suggested that in all three regions RNA virus discovery was best predicted by land use and socio- economic variables, followed by climatic variables and biodiversity, though the relative importance of these predictors varied by region. Map of virus discovery probability in 2010- 2019 indicated several new hotspots outside historical high-risk areas. Most new virus species since 2010 in each region (6/6 in the United States, 19/19 in China, 12/19 in Africa) were discovered in high risk areas as predicted by our model.\n\nConclusionsThe drivers of spatiotemporal variation in virus discovery rates vary in different regions of the world. Within regions virus discovery is driven mainly by land-use and socio- economic variables; climate and biodiversity variables are consistently less important predictors than at a global scale. Potential new discovery hotspots in 2010-2019 are identified. Results from the study could guide active surveillance for new human-infective viruses in local high risk areas.\n\nFundingDarwin Trust of Edinburgh; European Union.",

Here, we identify two acid-sensing ion channels, with very different proton sensing properties, and describe their role in an ultradian clock, the defecation motor program (DMP) of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. An ACD-5-containing channel, on the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium, is essential for maintenance of luminal acidity, and thus the rhythmic oscillations in lumen pH. In contrast, the second channel, composed of FLR-1, ACD-3 and/or DEL-5, located on the basolateral membrane, controls the intracellular Ca2+ wave and forms a core component of the master oscillator that controls timing and rhythmicity of the DMP. flr-1 and acd-3/del-5 mutants show severe developmental and metabolic defects. We thus directly link the proton-sensing properties of these channels to their physiological roles in pH regulation and Ca2+ signaling, the generation of an ultradian oscillator, and its metabolic consequences.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTwo acid-sensing DEG/ENaC channels play distinct roles in controlling different aspects of rhythmic proton and Ca2+ oscillations in the C. elegans intestine.",

Recent studies have suggested shared genes and pathways are enriched for DNMs across multiple disorders. However, existing analytic strategies only focus on genes that reach statistical significance for multiple disorders and require large trio samples in each study. As a result, these methods are not able to characterize the full landscape of genetic sharing due to polygenicity and incomplete penetrance. In this work, we introduce EncoreDNM, a novel statistical framework to quantify shared genetic effects between two disorders characterized by concordant enrichment of DNMs in the exome. EncoreDNM makes use of exome-wide, summary-level DNM data, including genes that do not reach statistical significance in single-disorder analysis, to evaluate the overall and annotation-partitioned genetic sharing between two disorders. Applying EncoreDNM to DNM data of nine disorders, we identified abundant pairwise enrichment correlations, especially in genes intolerant to pathogenic mutations and genes highly expressed in fetal tissues. These results suggest that EncoreDNM improves current analytic approaches and may have broad applications in DNM studies.",

Whether and how sleep deprivation modulates human brain physiology and cognition is not well understood. Here we examined how overnight sleep deprivation vs sufficient sleep affects (a) cortical excitability, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), (b) inducibility of LTP-and-LTD-like plasticity via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and (c) learning, memory and attention. The results suggest that sleep deprivation upscales cortical excitability due to enhanced glutamate-related cortical facilitation and decreased and/or reversed GABAergic cortical inhibition. Furthermore, tDCS-induced LTP-like plasticity abolishes while LTD-like plasticity converts to excitatory LTP-like plasticity under sleep deprivation. This is associated with increased EEG theta activity, which is related to sleep pressure. Finally, we show that learning and memory formation, behavioral counterparts of plasticity, and working memory and attention, which rely on cortical excitability, are impaired during sleep deprivation. Our data suggest that upscaled brain excitability, and altered plasticity, due to sleep deprivation, are associated with impaired cognitive performance.",

Here, we elucidate a potential hydrodynamic mechanism of rheotaxis through the study of the bidirectional coupling between fish and the surrounding fluid. By modeling a fish as a vortex dipole in an infinite channel with an imposed background flow, we establish a planar dynamical system for the cross-stream coordinate and orientation. The system dynamics captures the existence of a critical flow speed for fish to successfully orient while performing cross-stream, periodic sweeping movements. Model predictions are examined in the context of experimental observations in the literature on the rheotactic behavior of fish deprived of visual and lateral line cues. The crucial role of bidirectional hydrodynamic interactions unveiled by this model points at an overlooked limitation of existing experimental paradigms to study rheotaxis in the laboratory.",

Groups of genetic interactions known as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) play a key role in the generation of such patterns. However, how the topology and parameters of GRNs determine patterning in vivo remains unclear due to the complexity of most experimental systems. To address this, we use the zebrafish notochord, an organ where coin-shaped precursor cells are initially arranged in a simple unidimensional geometry. These cells then differentiate into vacuolated and sheath cells. Using newly developed transgenic tools together with in vivo imaging, we identify jag1a and her6/her9 as the main components of a Notch GRN that generates a lateral inhibition pattern and determines cell fate. Making use of this experimental system and mathematical modeling we show that lateral inhibition patterning requires that ligand-receptor interactions are stronger within the same cell than in neighboring cells. Altogether, we establish the zebrafish notochord as an experimental system to study pattern generation, and identify and characterize how the properties of GRNs determine self-organization of gene patterning and cell fate.",

This relationship is puzzling because overall changes in correlated variability should minimally affect optimal information coding. We hypothesize that this relationship arises because instead of using optimal strategies for decoding the specific stimuli at hand, observers prioritize generality: a single set of neuronal weights to decode any stimuli. We tested this using a combination of multineuron recordings in the visual cortex of behaving rhesus monkeys and a cortical circuit model. We found that general decoders optimized for broad rather than narrow sets of visual stimuli better matched the animals decoding strategy, and that their performance was more related to the magnitude of correlated variability. In conclusion, the inverse relationship between perceptual performance and correlated variability can be explained by observers using a general decoding strategy, capable of decoding neuronal responses to the variety of stimuli encountered in natural vision.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe frequently observed relationship between perceptual performance and correlated variability in sensory cortex can be explained by observers using a decoding strategy that prioritizes generality for many stimuli over precision.",

Here we report on the application of metabolomic tools to the genus Actinoallomurus, a poorly explored member of the Actinobacteria. From examining extracts derived from 88 isolates belonging to this genus, we identified a family of cyclodepsipeptides acylated with a C20 polyketide chain, which we named allopeptimicins. These molecules possess unusual structural features, including several double bonds in the amino-polyketide chain and four non-proteinogenic amino acids in the octapeptide. Remarkably, allopeptimicins are produced as a complex of active and inactive congeners, the latter carrying a sulfate group on the polyketide amine. This modification is also a mechanism of self-protection in the producer strain. The structural uniqueness of allopeptimicins is reflected in a biosynthetic gene cluster showing a mosaic structure, with dedicated gene cassettes devoted to formation of specialized precursors and modular assembly lines related to those from different pathways.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Despite being in a golden age of bacterial epigenomics, little work has systematically examined the plasticity and functional impacts of the bacterial DNA methylome. Here, we leveraged SMRT sequencing to examine the m6A DNA methylome of two Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium strains: 14028s and a {Delta}metJ mutant with derepressed methionine metabolism, grown in Luria Broth or a media that simulates the intracellular environment. We find that the methylome is remarkably static--over 95% of adenosine bases retain their methylation status across conditions. Integration of methylation with transcriptomic data revealed limited correlation between changes in methylation and gene expression. Further, examining the transcriptome in {Delta}yhdJ bacteria, lacking the m6A methylase with the most dynamic methylation pattern in our dataset, revealed little evidence of YhdJ-mediated gene regulation. Curiously, despite G(m6A)TC motifs being particularly resistant to change across conditions, incorporating dam mutants into our analyses revealed two examples where changes in methylation and transcription may be linked across conditions. This includes the novel finding that the {Delta}metJ motility defect may be partially driven by hypermethylation of the chemotaxis gene tsr. Together, these data redefine the S. Typhimurium epigenome as a highly stable system that has rare, but important, roles in transcriptional regulation. Incorporating these lessons into future studies will be critical as we progress through the epigenomic era.\n\nImportanceWhile recent breakthroughs have enabled intense study of bacterial DNA modifications, limitations in current work have potentiated a surprisingly untested narrative that DNA methylation is a common mechanism of the bacterial response to environmental conditions. Essentially, whether epigenetic regulation of bacterial transcription is a common, generalizable phenomenon is a critical unanswered question that we address here. We find that most DNA methylation is static in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, even when the bacteria are grown under dramatically different conditions that cause broad changes in the transcriptome. Further, even when the methylation of individual bases change, these changes generally do not correlate with changes in gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate methods by which data can be stratified in order to identify coupled changes in methylation and gene expression.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Hormonal contraceptives (HCs) are commonly used among reproductive aged women and alter the physiological state of the user by interfering with endogenous hormone concentrations and their actions on the reproductive tract. As hormones such as estradiol and progesterone modulate the incidence of substance abuse disorders in women, it is important to consider the influence HCs have on the female brain and behavior. This experiment explores how female sex steroid hormonal states associated with the rat estrous cycle, and modulating those states with HCs, influences measures of drug preference and responsivity. First, rats underwent food-light Pavlovian conditioning to measure conditioned orienting, a known predictor of amphetamine (AMP) place preference. Then, rats were conditioned and tested for AMP place preference with either an HC-implant or during estrous cycle stages associated with different ovarian hormone levels (i.e., proestrus (P) or metestrus/diestrus (M/D) while recording ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as an index of hedonic responsivity. Because of dopamines (DA) role in modulation of AMP actions, DA cell activity and availability were examined using tyrosine hydroxylase and FOS immunohistochemistry after final AMP challenge. Conditioned orienting did not differ between cycling and HC-implanted. P rats emitted more USVs during conditioning, showed higher AMP place preference throughout testing, and had higher DA cell activity in the substantia nigra compared to M/D and HC-implanted rats. Sex steroid hormone serum concentration and uterine horn thickness predicted some but not all of these measures. This experiment suggests ovarian hormones affect drug preference and responsivity, while providing novel insight into how hormone-altering contraceptives may reduce these measures.",

Thus, PFN1 is essential for the normal division, motility, and morphology of cells. Unfortunately, conventional fusion and direct labeling strategies compromise different facets of PFN1 function. As a consequence, the only methods used to determine known PFN1 functions have been indirect and often deduced in cell-free biochemical assays. We engineered and characterized two genetically encoded versions of tagged PFN1 that behave identical to each other and the tag-free protein. In biochemical assays purified proteins bind to PIP lipids, catalyze nucleotide exchange on actin monomers, stimulate formin-mediated actin filament assembly, and impact microtubule dynamics. Halo-PFN1 or mApple-PFN1 restored morphological and cytoskeletal functions in PFN1-deficient mammalian cells. In biochemical assays, mAp-PFN1 bound tubulin dimers (kD = 1.89 M) and the sides of microtubules in vitro. Titrations of self-labeling Haloligands were used to visualize molecules of PFN1. This approach combined with specific function-disrupting point-mutants (Y6D and R88E) revealed PFN1 bound to microtubules in live cells. Cells expressing the ALS-associated G118V disease variant did not associate with actin filaments or microtubules. Thus, these tagged PFN1s are reliable tools for studying the dynamic interactions of PFN1 with actin or microtubules in vitro as well as in important cell processes or disease-states.",

The main dietary sources of vitamin E are seed oils that often accumulate high levels of tocopherol isoforms with lower vitamin E activity. The tocochromanol biosynthetic pathway is conserved across plant species but an integrated view of the genes and mechanisms underlying natural variation of tocochromanol levels in seed of most cereal crops remains limited. To address this issue, we utilized the high mapping resolution of the maize Ames panel of [~]1,500 inbred lines scored with 12.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms to generate metabolomic (mature grain tocochromanols) and transcriptomic (developing grain) data sets for genetic mapping. By combining results from genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies, we identified a total of 13 candidate causal gene loci, including five that had not been previously associated with maize grain tocochromanols: four biosynthetic genes (arodeH2 paralog, dxs1, vte5, and vte7) and a plastid S-adenosyl methionine transporter (samt1). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping of these 13 gene loci revealed that they are predominantly regulated by cis-eQTL. Through a joint statistical analysis, we implicated cis-acting variants as responsible for co-localized eQTL and GWAS association signals. Our multi-omics approach provided increased statistical power and mapping resolution to enable a detailed characterization of the genetic and regulatory architecture underlying tocochromanol accumulation in maize grain and provided insights for ongoing biofortification efforts to breed and/or engineer vitamin E and antioxidant levels in maize and other cereals.",

To this end, we consider genetic modifier sites at which mutations, \"mutator alleles\", increase genome-wide mutation rates and model their evolution under purifying selection due to the additional deleterious mutations that they cause, genetic drift, and demographic processes. We solve the model analytically for a constant population size and characterize how evolution at modifier sites impacts variation in mutation rates within and among populations. We then use simulations to study the effects of modifier sites under a plausible demographic model for Africans and Europeans. When comparing populations that evolve independently, weakly selected modifier sites (2Nes {approx} 1), which evolve slowly, contribute the most to variation in mutation rates. In contrast, when populations recently split from a common ancestral population, strongly selected modifier sites (2Nes >> 1), which evolve rapidly, contribute the most to variation between them. Moreover, a modest number of modifier sites (e.g., 10 per mutation type in the standard classification into 96 types) subject to moderate to strong selection (2Nes > 1) could account for the variation in mutation rates observed among human populations. If such modifier sites indeed underlie differences among populations, they should also cause variation in mutation rates within populations and their effects should be detectable in pedigree studies.",

At some loci, however, it happens that one allele is favored to the expense of the other. Gamete killers are genetic systems where one allele (the killer) triggers the death of the gametes carrying the other (killed) allele. They have been found in many organisms, and are of major interest to understand mechanisms of evolution and speciation. Gamete killers are particularly prevalent in plants, where they can compromise crop breeding. Here, we deciphered a pollen killer in Arabidopsis thaliana by exploiting natural variation, de novo genomic sequencing and mutants, and analyzing segregations in crosses. We found that the killer allele carries an antidote gene flanked by two elements mandatory for the killing activity. We identified the gene encoding the antidote, a chimeric protein addressed to mitochondria. This gene appeared in the species by association of domains recruited from other genes, and it recently underwent duplications within a highly variable locus, particularly in the killer genotypes. Exploring the species diversity, we identified sequence polymorphisms correlated with the antidote activity.",

Understanding how this variation emerges over evolutionary time requires large-scale phylogenetic comparisons of behavioral repertoires. Here, we describe the evolution of walking in fruit flies by capturing high-resolution, unconstrained movement from 13 species and 15 strains of drosophilids. We find that walking can be captured in a universal behavior space, the structure of which is evolutionarily conserved. However, the occurrence of, and transitions between, specific movements have evolved rapidly, resulting in repeated convergent evolution in the temporal structure of locomotion. Moreover, a meta-analysis demonstrates that many behaviors evolve more rapidly than other traits. Thus, the architecture and physiology of locomotor circuits can both execute precise individual movements in one species and simultaneously support rapid evolutionary changes in the temporal ordering of these modular elements across clades.",

Inhibiting bone resorption or Mmp13 increases jaw length. Here, we uncover mechanisms establishing species-specific levels of Mmp13 and bone resorption. Quail show greater activation of, and sensitivity to Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF{beta}) signaling than duck; where mediators like SMADs and targets like Runx2, which bind Mmp13, become elevated. Inhibiting TGF{beta} signaling decreases bone resorption. We discover a SMAD binding element in the quail Mmp13 promoter not found in duck and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near a RUNX2 binding element that affect expression. Switching the SNPs and SMAD site abolishes TGF{beta}-sensitivity in the quail Mmp13 promoter but makes duck responsive. Thus, differential regulation of TGF{beta} signaling and Mmp13 promoter structure underlie avian jaw development and evolution.",

We demonstrate how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic variation including enrichment of blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis, defining monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and identifying intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that are critical for predisposition to acute leukemia.

The growing fetus continuously loads the maternal organs as circulating hormone levels surge, leading to significant changes in mechanical and hormonal cues during pregnancy. In response, maternal soft tissues undergo remarkable growth and remodeling to support the mother and baby for a healthy pregnancy. We focus on the maternal left ventricle, which increases its cardiac output and mass during pregnancy. This study develops a multiscale cardiac growth model for pregnancy to understand how mechanical and hormonal cues interact to drive this growth process. We coupled a cell signaling network model that predicts cell-level hypertrophy in response to hormones and stretch to a compartmental model of the rat heart and circulation that predicts organ-level growth in response to hemodynamic changes. We calibrated this multiscale model to data from experimental volume overload (VO) and hormonal infusions of angiotensin 2 (AngII), estrogen (E2), and progesterone (P4). We then validated the models ability to capture interactions between inputs by comparing model predictions against published observations for the combinations of VO+E2 and AngII+E2. Finally, we simulated pregnancy-induced changes in hormones and hemodynamics to predict heart growth during pregnancy. Our model produced growth consistent with experimental data. Overall, our analysis suggests that the rise in P4 during the first half of gestation is an important contributor to heart growth during pregnancy. We conclude with suggestions for future experimental studies that will provide a better understanding of how hormonal and mechanical cues interact to drive pregnancy-induced heart growth.",

At lab scale, petroleum-based hydrophobic bio-compatible solvents like dodecane can be used as a second phase on top of microbial cultures to act as a physical sink for heterologous hydrocarbon products like isoprenoids. However, this approach has significant drawbacks at scale due to the difficulty of handling solvents and their potential contamination with unwanted byproducts of their manufacture. We discovered that synthetic perfluorocarbon liquids (FCs), commonly used for heat transfer, can also act as physical sinks for microbially produced isoprenoid compounds. FCs are stable, inert, and are amenable to direct liquid-liquid extraction with alcohols for rapid product isolation. These liquids are more dense than water and form a lower phase to microbial cultures rather than an upper phase as with other solvents. Their ability to form an under-layer or  underlay also enables the cultivation of microbes directly at the FC-culture medium interface via gravity settling, which could open their application for filamentous or mat-forming organisms. We present comparisons of the isoprenoid extraction potential of three commercial FCs: FC-3283, FC-40, and FC-770 with engineered green microalga cultures producing patchoulol, taxadiene, casbene, or 13R(+) manoyl oxide. We demonstrate that FCs are promising alternatives to traditional solvents and open new avenues in bio-process design for microbial heterologous metabolite milking.",

However, transcription factors interact with each other, and their collaborative regulatory activities go beyond the linear DNA sequence. Therefore leveraging the informative 3D chromatin organization to investigate the collaborations among transcription factors is critical. We developed ECHO, a graph-based neural network, to predict chromatin features and characterize the collaboration among them by incorporating 3D chromatin organization from 200-bp high-resolution Micro-C contact maps. ECHO predicts 2, 583 chromatin features with significantly higher average AUROC and AUPR than the best sequence-based model. We observed that chromatin contacts of different distances affected different types of chromatin features prediction in diverse ways, suggesting complex and divergent collaborative regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, ECHO was interpretable via gradient-based attribution methods. The attributions on chromatin contacts identify important contacts relevant to chromatin features. The attributions on DNA sequences identify TF binding motifs and TF collaborative binding. Furthermore, combining the attributions on contacts and sequences reveals important sequence patterns in the neighborhood which are relevant to target sequences chromatin feature prediction. The attribution results that reveal TF collaboration activities are provided on a website https://echo.dcmb.med.umich.edu/echo/.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Mutation rates are of key importance for understanding evolutionary processes and predicting their outcomes. Empirical estimates of mutation rate are available for a number of RNA viruses, but few are available for DNA viruses, which tend to have larger genomes. Whilst some viruses have very high mutation rates, lower mutation rates are expected for viruses with large genomes to ensure genome integrity. Alphabaculoviruses are insect viruses with large genomes and often have high levels of polymorphism, suggesting high mutation rates despite evidence of proofreading activity by the replication machinery. Here, we report an empirical estimate of the mutation rate per base per strand copying (s/n/r) of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). To avoid biases due to selection, we analyzed mutations that occurred in a stable, non-functional genomic insert after five serial passages in Spodoptera exigua larvae. Population bottlenecks, viral mode of replication and thresholds for mutation detection likely affect mutation rate estimates, and we therefore used population genetic models that account for these processes to infer the mutation rate. We estimated a mutation rate of 1x10-7 s/n/r. This estimate was not sensitive to different model assumptions or including whole genome data. The rates at which different classes of mutations accumulate provide good evidence for neutrality of mutations occurring within the inserted region. We therefore present a robust approach for mutation rate estimation for viruses with stable genomes, and strong evidence of a much lower alphabaculovirus mutation rate than supposed based on the high levels of polymorphism observed.\n\nAuthor SummaryVirus populations can evolve rapidly, driven by the large number of mutations that occur during virus replication. It is challenging to measure mutation rates because selection will affect which mutations are observed: beneficial mutations are overrepresented in virus populations, while deleterious mutations are selected against and therefore underrepresented. Few mutation rates have been estimated for viruses with large DNA genomes, and there are no estimates for any insect virus. Here, we estimate the mutation rate for an alphabaculovirus, a virus that infects caterpillars and has a large, 134 kilobase pair DNA genome. To ensure that selection did not bias our estimate of mutation rate, we studied which mutations occurred in a large artificial region inserted into the virus genome, where mutations did not affect viral fitness. We deep sequenced evolved virus populations, and compared the distribution of observed mutants to predictions from a simulation model to estimate mutation rate. We found evidence for a relatively low mutation rate, of one mutation in every 10 million bases replicated. This estimate is in line with expectations for a virus with self-correcting replication machinery and a large genome.",

Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has an unusually large 5' UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5' terminal 360 nucleotide stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs by selective 2' hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Vision provides the most important sensory information for spatial navigation. Recent technical advances allow new options to conduct more naturalistic experiments in virtual reality (VR) while additionally gather data of the viewing behavior with eye tracking investigations. Here, we propose a method that allows one to quantify characteristics of visual behavior by using graph-theoretical measures to abstract eye tracking data recorded in a 3D virtual urban environment.\n\nThe analysis is based on eye tracking data of 20 participants, who freely explored the virtual city Seahaven for 90 minutes with an immersive VR headset with an inbuild eye tracker. To extract what participants looked at, we defined \"gaze\" events, from which we created gaze graphs. On these, we applied graph-theoretical measures to reveal the underlying structure of visual attention.\n\nApplying graph partitioning, we found that our virtual environment could be treated as one coherent city. To investigate the importance of houses in the city, we applied the node degree centrality measure. Our results revealed that 10 houses had a node degree that exceeded consistently two-sigma distance from the mean node degree of all other houses. The importance of these houses was supported by the hierarchy index, which showed a clear hierarchical structure of the gaze graphs. As these high node degree houses fulfilled several characteristics of landmarks, we named them \"gaze-graph-defined landmarks\". Applying the rich club coefficient, we found that these gaze-graph-defined landmarks were preferentially connected to each other and that participants spend the majority of their experiment time in areas where at least two of those houses were visible.\n\nOur findings do not only provide new experimental evidence for the development of spatial knowledge, but also establish a new methodology to identify and assess the function of landmarks in spatial navigation based on eye tracking data.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe ability to navigate and orient ourselves in an unknown environment is important in everyday life. To better understand how we are able to learn about a new environment, it is important to study our behavior during the process of spatial navigation. New technical advances allow us to conduct studies in naturalistic virtual environments with participants wearing immersive VR-headsets. In addition, we can use eye trackers to observe the participants eye movements. This is interesting, because observing eye movements allows us to observe visual attention and, therefore, important cognitive processes. However, it can be difficult to analyze eye tracking data that was measured in a VR environment, as there is no established algorithm yet. Therefore, we propose a new method to analyze such eye tracking data. In addition, our method allows us to transform the eye tracking data into graphs which we can use to find new patterns in behavior that were not accessible before. Using this methodology, we found that participants who spend 90 min exploring a new virtual town, viewed some houses preferentially and we call them gaze-graph-defined landmarks. Our further analysis reveals also new characteristics of those houses that were not yet associated with landmarks.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The sumoylation (SUMO) pathway is involved in a variety of processes during C. elegans development, such as gonadal and vulval fate specification, cell cycle progression and maintenance of chromosome structure. The ubiquitous expression of the sumoylation machinery and its involvement in many essential processes has made it difficult to dissect the tissue-specific roles of protein sumoylation and identify the specific target proteins. To overcome these challenges, we have established tools to block protein sumoylation and degrade sumoylated target proteins in a tissue-specific and temporally controlled manner. We employed the auxin-inducible protein degradation system (AID) to down-regulate AID-tagged SUMO E3 ligase GEI-17 or the SUMO ortholog SMO-1, either in the vulval precursor cells (VPCs) or in the gonadal anchor cell (AC). Tissue-specific inhibition of GEI-17 and SMO-1 revealed diverse roles of the SUMO pathway during vulval development, such as AC positioning, basement membrane (BM) breaching, vulval cell fate specification and epithelial morphogenesis. Inhibition of sumoylation in the VPCs resulted in an abnormal shape of the vulval toroids and ectopic cell fusions. Sumoylation of the ETS transcription factor LIN-1 at K169 mediates a subset of these SUMO functions, especially the proper contraction of the ventral vulA toroids. Thus, the SUMO pathway plays diverse roles throughout vulval development.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Global regulation of spindle-associated proteins is crucial in oocytes due to the absence of centrosomes and their very large cytoplasmic volume, but little is known about how this is achieved beyond involvement of the Ran-importin pathway. We previously uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism in Drosophila oocytes, in which the phospho-docking protein 14-3-3 suppresses microtubule binding of Kinesin-14/Ncd away from chromosomes. Here we report systematic identification of microtubule-associated proteins regulated by 14-3-3 from Drosophila oocytes. Proteins from ovary extract were co-sedimented with microtubules in the presence or absence of a 14-3-3 inhibitor. Through quantitative mass-spectrometry, we identified proteins or complexes whose ability to binding microtubules is suppressed by 14-3-3, including the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), the centralspindlin complex and Kinesin-14/Ncd. We showed that 14-3-3 binds to the disordered region of Borealin, and this binding is regulated differentially by two phosphorylations on Borealin. Mutations at these two phospho-sites compromised normal Borealin localisation and centromere bi-orientation in oocytes, showing that phospho-regulation of 14-3-3 binding is important for Borealin localisation and function. The mass spectrometry data are available from ProteomeXchange, identifier <ID to be provided when available, PXD000xxx>.\n\nAuthor SummaryAccurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division is fundamental for genome stability. Chromosome segregation is mediated by the spindle, which is made of dynamic microtubules and associated proteins that regulate microtubule behaviour. How these microtubule-associated proteins are regulated is not well understood. Furthermore, as oocytes have an exceptionally large volume of cytoplasm and lack centrosomes, regulation of microtubule-associated proteins is especially crucial for organisation and function of the meiotic spindle. In this study, we showed that 14-3-3, a protein that binds to phosphorylated proteins, plays an important role to regulate multiple microtubule-associated proteins in fly oocytes. The regulated proteins include subunits of the conserved kinase complex called the chromosomal passenger complex. We further found that interaction of one of the subunits with 14-3-3 is regulated by two phosphorylations, and that these phosphorylations are important for localisation and function of this subunit. As these proteins are widely conserved including humans, this study may provide an insight into chromosome mis-segregation in human oocytes, which is very frequent and a major cause of human infertility, miscarriages and congenital birth conditions.",

To achieve an HIV-1 cure, the reservoir of activatable proviruses should be eliminated while permanently silenced proviruses may be tolerated. We have developed a method to assess the proviral nuclear microenvironment in single cells. In latently HIV-1 infected cells, a zinc finger protein tethered to the HIV-1 promoter produced a fluorescent signal as a protein of interest came in its proximity, such as the viral transactivator Tat when recruited to the nascent RNA. Tat is essential for viral replication. In these cells we assessed the proviral activation and chromatin composition. By linking Tat recruitment to proviral activity, we dissected the mechanisms of HIV-1 latency reversal and the consequences of HIV-1 production. A pulse of promoter-associated Tat was identified that contrasted to the continuous production of viral proteins. As expected, promoter H3K4me3 led to substantial expression of the provirus following T cell stimulation. However, the activation-induced cell cycle arrest and death led to a surviving cell fraction with proviruses encapsulated in repressive chromatin. Further, this cellular model was used to reveal mechanisms of action of small molecules. In a proof-of-concept study we determined the effect of an enhancer specific CBP/P300-inhibitor on HIV-1 latency reversal. Only proviruses resembling active enhancers, associated with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, efficiently recruited Tat. Tat-independent HIV-1 latency reversal of unknown significance still occurred. We present a method for single cell assessment of the microenvironment of the latent HIV-1 proviruses, used here to reveal how T cell stimulation modulates the proviral activity and how the subsequent fate of the infected cell depends on the chromatin context.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Super-resolution imaging techniques have provided a better understanding of the relationship between the nanoscale organization of function of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in cardiomy-ocytes. Interestingly recent data have indicated that this relationship is disrupted in heart failure (HF), as RyRs are dispersed into smaller and more numerous clusters. However, RyRs are also hyperphosphorylated in this condition, and this is reported to occur preferentially within the cluster centre. Thus, the combined impact of RyR relocalization and sensitization on Ca2+ spark generation in failing cardiomyocytes is likely complex and these observations suggest that both the nanoscale organization of RyRs and the pattern of phosphorylated RyRs within clusters could be critical determinants of Ca2+ spark dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we used computational modeling to quantify the relationships between RyR cluster geometry, phosphorylation patterns, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release. We found that RyR cluster disruption results in a decrease in spark fidelity and longer sparks with a lower amplitude. Phosphorylation of some RyRs within the cluster can play a compensatory role, recovering healthy spark dynamics. Interestingly, our model predicts that such compensation is critically dependent on the phosphorylation pattern, as phosphorylation localized within the cluster center resulted in longer Ca2+ sparks and higher spark fidelity compared to a uniformly distributed phosphorylation pattern. Our results strongly suggest that both the phosphorylation pattern and nanoscale RyR reorganization are critical determinants of Ca2+ dynamics in HF.\n\nSignificance StatementRyRs are ion channels located on the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum that are responsible for an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ during cell excitation. Here, we investigate how the geometry of RyR clusters combined with spatial phosphorylation patterns impacts on Ca2+ spark generation and kinetics. The findings from our study show that both phosphorylation pattern and RyR cluster shape and dispersion have implications on Ca2+ spark activity and provide insights into altered Ca2+ dynamics during HF.",

The dynamics of ecosystems have been drawn as state-transition graphs for more than a century, from state-and-transition models to assembly graphs. Thus, model-checking can provide insights into both empirical data and theoretical models, as long as they sum up into state-transition graphs. While model-checking proved to be a valuable tool in systems biology, it remains largely underused in ecology. Here we promote the adoption of the model-checking toolbox in ecology through its application to an illustrative example. We assessed the dynamics of a vegetation model inspired from state-and-transition models by model-checking Computation Tree Logic formulas built from a proposed catalogue of patterns. Model-checking encompasses a wide range of concepts and available software, mentioned in discussion, thus its implementation can be fitted to the specific features of the described system. In addition to the automated analysis of ecological state-transition graphs, we believe that defining ecological concepts with temporal logics could help clarifying and comparing them.\n\nAuthor summaryEcologists have drawn state-transition graphs representing the dynamics of ecosystems for more than a century. Model-checking is an automated method for the analysis of such graphs developed in computer science and acknowledged by a Turing award in 2007. Ecologists appear to be mostly unaware of model-checking despite its successes in systems biology to assess the dynamics of biological networks.\n\nWe promote model-checking of ecological state-transition graphs through its application to an illustrative vegetation model. We exemplify the insights provided by model-checking by assessing management policies aiming to tackle savanna encroachment. We also provide a catalogue of patterns to help ecologists with the difficulty of formally expressing dynamical properties. We also discuss the wide range of model-checking concepts and available software, enabling to fit the specific features of the studied system, such as durations or probabilities.\n\nModel-checking can be applied to both empirical data and theoretical models, as long as they sum up into state-transition graphs.

Here, we describe a highly accurate SleepV (video) system and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based adult brain chimeric (ABC)- expression/knockout (KO) platform for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice.

    "preprint_abstract": "We used pupillometry to evaluate the effects of attention cueing on perceptual bi-stability, as reported by adult human observers. Perceptual alternations and pupil diameter were measured during two forms of rivalry, generated by presenting a white and a black disk to the two eyes (binocular rivalry) or splitting the disks between eyes (interocular grouping rivalry). In line with previous studies, we found that subtle pupil size oscillations (about 0.05 mm) tracked alternations between exclusive dominance phases of the black or white disk. These oscillations were larger for perceptually stronger stimuli: presented to the dominant eye or with physically higher luminance contrast. However, cueing of endogenous attention to one of the rivaling percepts did not affect pupil oscillations during exclusive dominance phases. This was in spite of the reliable effects of endogenous attention on perceptual dominance, which shifted in favor of the cued percept by about 10%. The results were comparable for binocular and interocular grouping rivalry. Cueing only had a marginal modulatory effect on pupil size during mixed percepts in binocular rivalry. This may suggest that, rather than acting by modulating perceptual strength, endogenous attention primarily acts during periods of unresolved competition, which is compatible with attention being automatically directed to the rivaling stimuli during periods of exclusive dominance and thereby sustaining perceptual alternations.\n\nSignificance StatementBinocular rivalry depends on attention. When it is diverted away from the stimuli, perceptual alternations slow down; when it is preferentially directed to one stimulus, perception lingers more on it, consistent with attention enhancing the effective strength of the rivaling stimuli. Here we introduce pupillometry as a means to indirectly track changes in effective stimulus strength. We find that pupil size oscillates, accurately tracking perceived luminance during two forms of rivalry: binocular rivalry and interocular grouping rivalry. Both show robust effects of attention cueing on perceptual dominance, but pupil oscillations during exclusive dominance are unaffected by cueing. This suggests that endogenous attention does not affect perceptual strength during exclusive dominance, though it might do so during transition phases.",

Chromatin organization is a dynamic process that can be affected by biotic and abiotic stresses. Three-dimensional imaging technology allows to follow these dynamic changes, but only a few semi-automated processing methods currently exist for quantitative analysis of the 3D chromatin organization.\n\nResultsWe present an automated method, Nuclear Object DetectionJ (NODeJ), developed as an imageJ plugin. This program segments and analyzes high intensity domains in nuclei from 3D images. NODeJ performs a Laplacian convolution on the mask of a nucleus to enhance the contrast of intra-nuclear objects and allows their detection. We reanalyzed public datasets and determined that NODeJ is able to accurately identify heterochromatin domains from a diverse set of Arabidopsis thaliana nuclei stained with DAPI or Hoechst. NODeJ is also able to detect signals in nuclei from DNA FISH experiments, allowing for the analysis of specific targets of interest.\n\nConclusion and availabilityNODeJ allows for efficient automated analysis of subnuclear structures by avoiding the semi-automated steps, resulting in reduced processing time and analytical bias.

    "preprint_abstract": "Hybridization between lineages that have not reached complete reproductive isolation appears more and more like a common phenomenon. Indeed, speciation genomics studies have now extensively shown that many species genomes have hybrid ancestry. However, genomic patterns of introgression are often heterogeneous across the genome. In many organisms, a positive correlation between introgression levels and recombination rate has been observed. It is usually explained by the purging of deleterious introgressed material due to incompatibilities. However, the opposite relationship was observed in a North American population of Drosophila melanogaster with admixed European and African ancestry. In order to explore how directional and epistatic selection can impact the relationship between introgression and recombination, we performed forward simulations of whole D. melanogaster genomes reflecting the North American populations history. Our results revealed that the simplest models of positive selection often yield negative correlations between introgression and recombination such as the one observed in D. melanogaster. We also confirmed that incompatibilities tend to produce positive introgression-recombination correlations. And yet, we identify parameter space under each model where the predicted correlation is reversed. These findings deepen our understanding of the evolutionary forces that may shape patterns of ancestry across genomes, and they strengthen the foundation for future studies aimed at estimating genome-wide parameters of selection in admixed populations.",

Asymmetric lignin deposition within endocarpb cell walls is one such innovation that is required for explosive seed dispersal and evolved in association with the trait. However, the genetic control of this novel lignin pattern is unknown. Here, we identify three lignin-polymerizing laccases, LAC4, 11 and 17, that precisely co-localize with, and are redundantly required for, asymmetric lignification of endocarpb cells. By screening for C. hirsuta mutants with less lignified fruit valves, we found that loss of function of the transcription factor gene SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 7 (SPL7) caused a reduction in endocarpb cell wall lignification and a consequent reduction in seed dispersal range. SPL7 is a conserved regulator of copper homeostasis and is both necessary and sufficient for copper to accumulate in the fruit. Laccases are copper-requiring enzymes. We discovered that laccase activity in endocarpb cell walls depends on the SPL7 pathway to acclimate to copper deficiency and provide sufficient copper for lignin polymerization. Hence, SPL7 links mineral nutrition to efficient dispersal of the next generation.",

Recently, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) has been identified as an essential assembly cofactor that efficiently produces both immature virions in vivo and immature virus-like particles in vitro. To date, however, several distinct mechanistic roles for IP6 have been proposed on the basis of independent functional, structural, and kinetic studies. In this work, we investigate the molecular influence of IP6 on the structural outcomes and dynamics of CA/SP1 assembly using coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations. Here, we derive a bottom-up, low-resolution, and implicit-solvent CG model of CA/SP1 and IP6, and simulate their assembly under conditions that emulate both in vitro and in vivo systems. Our analysis identifies IP6 as an assembly accelerant that promotes curvature generation and fissure-like defects throughout the lattice. Our findings suggest that IP6 induces kinetically-trapped immature morphologies, which may be physiologically important for later stages of viral morphogenesis and potentially useful for virus-like particle technologies.",

These devices compensate for the loss of photoreceptors by electrically stimulating neurons in the retina. Currently, the visual function that can be recovered with such devices is very limited. This is due, in part, to current spread, unintended axonal activation, and the limited resolution of existing devices. Here we show, using a recent model of prosthetic vision, that optimizing how visual stimuli are encoded by the device can help overcome some of these limitations, leading to dramatic improvements in visual perception. We propose a strategy to do this in practice, using patients feedback in a visual task. The main challenge of our approach comes from the fact that, typically, one only has access to a limited number of noisy responses from patients. We propose two ways to deal with this: first, we use a model of prosthetic vision to constrain and simplify the optimization; second, we use preferential Bayesian optimization to efficiently learn the encoder using minimal trials. To test our approach, we presented healthy subjects with visual stimuli generated by a recent model of prosthetic vision, to replicate the perceptual experience of patients fitted with an implant. Our optimization procedure led to significant and robust improvements in perceived image quality, that transferred to increased performance in other tasks. Importantly, our strategy is agnostic to the type of prosthesis and thus could readily be implemented in existing implants.",

While these domains are often imagined as static structures, they are highly dynamic and show cell-to-cell variability. Since processes such as gene regulation and DNA replication occur in the context of these domains, it is important to understand their organization, fluctuation and dynamics. To simulate chromatin domains, one requires knowledge of interaction strengths among chromatin segments. Here, we derive interaction strength parameters from experimentally known contact maps and use them to predict chromatin organization and dynamics. Taking two domains on the human chromosome as examples, we investigate its 3D organization, size/shape fluctuations, and dynamics of different segments within a domain, accounting for hydrodynamic effects. Considering different cell types, we quantify changes in interaction strengths and chromatin shape fluctuations in different epigenetic states. Perturbing the interaction strengths systematically, we further investigate how epigenetic-like changes can alter the spatio-temporal nature of the domains. Our results show that heterogeneous weak interactions are crucial in determining the organization of the domains. Computing effective stiffness and relaxation times, we investigate how perturbations in interactions affect the solid-like and liquid-like nature of chromatin domains. Quantifying dynamics of chromatin segments within a domain, we show how the competition between polymer entropy and interaction energy influence the timescales of loop formation and maintenance of stable loops.",

Nevertheless, little is known about cell individuality in antibiotic accumulation. Here we hypothesize that phenotypic diversification can be driven by fundamental cell-to-cell differences in drug transport rates. To test this hypothesis, we employed microfluidics-based single-cell microscopy, libraries of fluorescent antibiotic probes and mathematical modelling. This approach allowed us to rapidly identify phenotypic variants that avoid antibiotic accumulation within populations of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Staphylococcus aureus. Crucially, we found that fast growing phenotypic variants avoid macrolide accumulation and survive treatment without genetic mutations. These findings are in contrast with the current consensus that cellular dormancy and slow metabolism underlie bacterial survival to antibiotics. Our results also show that fast growing variants display significantly higher expression of ribosomal promoters before drug treatment compared to slow growing variants. Drug-free active ribosomes facilitate essential cellular processes in these fast growing variants, including efflux that can reduce macrolide accumulation. Using this new knowledge, we phenotypically engineered bacterial populations by eradicating variants that displayed low antibiotic accumulation through the chemical manipulation of their outer membrane inspiring new avenues to overcome current antibiotic treatment failures.",

Two pioneering tools for clustering sequences are CD-HIT and UCLUST, both of which are fast and consume reasonable amounts of memory; however, there is a big room for improvement in terms of cluster quality. Motivated by this opportunity for improving cluster quality, we applied the mean shift algorithm in MeShClust v1.0. The mean shift algorithm is an instance of unsupervised learning. Its strong theoretical foundation guarantees the convergence to the true cluster centers. Our implementation of the mean shift algorithm in MeShClust v1.0 was a step forward; however, it was not the original algorithm. In this work, we make progress toward applying the original algorithm while utilizing alignment-free identity scores in a new tool: MeShClust v3.0.\n\nResultsWe evaluated CD-HIT, MeShClust v1.0, MeShClust v3.0, and UCLUST on 22 synthetic sets and five real sets. These data sets were designed or selected for testing the tools in terms of scalability and different similarity levels among sequences comprising clusters. On the synthetic data sets, MeShClust v3.0 outperformed the related tools on all sets in terms of cluster quality. On two real data sets obtained from human microbiome and maize transposons, MeShClust v3.0 outperformed the related tools by wide margins, achieving 55%--300% improvement in cluster quality. On another set that includes degenerate viral sequences, MeShClust v3.0 came third. On two bacterial sets, MeShClust v3.0 was the only applicable tool because of the long sequences in these sets. MeShClust v3.0 requires more time and memory than the related tools; almost all personal computers at the time of this writing can accommodate such requirements. MeShClust v3.0 can estimate an important parameter that controls cluster membership with high accuracy.\n\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate the high quality of clusters produced by MeShClust v3.0 and its ability to apply the mean shift algorithm to large data sets and long sequences. Because clustering tools are utilized in many studies, providing high-quality clusters will help with deriving accurate biological knowledge.",

Experiments were conducted across approximately one year and linear mixed effects models were used to assess significance.\n\nResultsContinuous stimulation at high frequencies led to rapid decreases in intensity, while low frequency stimulation maintained percept intensity for longer periods. Burst-modulated stimulation extended the time before the intensity began to decrease, but all protocols ultimately resulted in complete sensation loss within one minute. Intermittent stimulation paradigms with several seconds between stimulus trains also led to decreases in intensity on many electrodes, but never resulted in extinction of sensation after over three minutes of stimulation. Additionally, longer breaks between each pulse train resulted in some recovery of the stimulus-evoked percepts. For several electrodes, intermittent stimulation had almost no effect on the perceived intensity.\n\nConclusionsIntermittent ICMS paradigms were more effective at maintaining percepts, and given that transient activity in the somatosensory cortex dominates the response to object contact, this stimulation method may mimic natural cortical activity and improve the perception of stimulation over time.",

We generated mock communities of controlled biomass ratios from 28 species from all major soil mesofauna groups: mites, springtails, nematodes, tardigrades and potworms. We shotgun-sequenced these communities and taxonomically assigned them with a database of over 270 soil invertebrate genomes.\nC_LIO_LIWe recovered 90% of the species, and observed relatively high false positive detection rates. We found strong differences in reads assigned to different taxa, with some groups (e.g. springtails) consistently attracting more hits than others (e.g. enchytraeids). Original biomass could be predicted from read counts after considering these taxon-specific differences. Species with larger genomes, and with more complete assemblies consistently attracted more reads than species with smaller genomes. The GC content of the genome assemblies had no effect on the biomass-read relationships.\nC_LIO_LIThe results show considerable differences in taxon recovery and taxon specificity of biomass recovery from metagenomic sequence data. The properties of reference genomes and genome assemblies also influence biomass recovery, and they should be considered in metagenomic studies of eukaryotes. We provide a roadmap for investigating factors which influence metagenomics-based eukaryotic community reconstructions. Understanding these factors is timely as accessibility of DNA sequencing, and momentum for reference genomes projects show a future where the taxonomic assignment of DNA from any community sample becomes a reality.\nC_LI",

CheW-like domains occur in CheW scaffolding proteins, CheA kinases, and CheV proteins that regulate bacterial chemotaxis. We analyzed 16 domain architectures that included 94% of all CheW-like domains found in nature. We identified six Classes of CheW-like domains with presumed functional differences. CheV and most CheW proteins contained Class 1 domains, whereas some CheW proteins contained Class 6 ([~]20%) or Class 2 ([~]1%) domains instead. Most CheA proteins contained Class 3 domains.

Despite the dangers, proteins are sometimes born de novo from non-coding DNA. Proteins are more likely to be born from non-coding regions that produce peptides that do little to no harm when translated than from regions that produce harmful peptides. To investigate which newborn proteins are most likely to \"first, do no harm\", we estimate fitnesses from an experiment that competed Escherichia coli lineages that each expressed a unique random peptide. A variety of peptide metrics significantly predict lineage fitness, but this predictive power stems from simple amino acid frequencies rather than the ordering of amino acids. Amino acids that are smaller and that promote intrinsic structural disorder have more benign fitness effects. We validate that the amino acids that indicate benign effects in random peptides expressed in E. coli also do so in an independent dataset of random N-terminal tags in which it is possible to control for expression level. The same amino acids are also enriched in young animal proteins.\n\nSignificance statementProteins are sometimes born de novo. In an experiment to reproduce this process in Escherichia coli, we were able to predict 15% of the variation in random peptide fitness effects from their amino acid frequencies.

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundThe use of rumen microbial community (RMC) profiles to predict methane emissions has driven interest in ruminal DNA preservation and extraction protocols that can be processed cheaply while also maintaining or improving DNA quality for RMC profiling. Our standard approach for preserving rumen samples, as defined in the Global Rumen Census (GRC), requires time-consuming pre-processing steps of freeze drying and grinding prior to international transportation and DNA extraction. This impedes researchers unable to access sufficient funding or infrastructure. To circumvent these pre-processing steps, we investigated three methods of preserving rumen samples for subsequent DNA extraction, based on existing lysis buffers Tris-NaCl-EDTA-SDS (TNx2) and guanidine hydrochloride (GHx2), or 100% ethanol.\n\nResultsRumen samples were collected via stomach intubation from 151 sheep at two time-points two weeks apart. Each sample was separated into four subsamples and preserved using the three preservation methods and the GRC method (n = 4x302). DNA was extracted and sequenced using Restriction Enzyme-Reduced Representation Sequencing to generate RMC profiles. Differences in DNA yield, quality and integrity, and sequencing metrics were observed across the methods (p < 0.0001). Ethanol exhibited poorer quality DNA (A260/A230 < 2) and more failed samples compared to the other methods. Samples preserved using the GRC method had smaller relative abundances in gram-negative genera Anaerovibrio, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Selenomonas, and Succiniclasticum, but larger relative abundances in the majority of 56 additional genera compared to TNx2 and GHx2. However, log10 relative abundances across all genera and time-points for TNx2 and GHx2 were on average consistent (R2 > 0.99) but slightly more variable compared to the GRC method. Relative abundances were moderately to highly correlated (0.68 {+/-} 0.13) between methods for samples collected within a time-point, which was greater than the average correlation (0.17 {+/-} 0.11) between time-points within a preservation method.\n\nConclusionsThe two modified lysis buffers solutions (TNx2 and GHx2) proposed in this study were shown to be viable alternatives to the GRC method for RMC profiling in sheep. Use of these preservative solutions reduces cost and improves throughput associated with processing and sequencing ruminal samples. This development could significantly advance implementation of RMC profiles as a tool for breeding ruminant livestock.",

Although various biological membranes have shown to alter the structure and aggregation propensity of SN, a thorough understanding of the molecular and mechanical mechanism of amyloidogenesis in membranes remains unanswered. Herein, we examined the structural changes, binding properties, and amyloidogenicity of three variations of SN mutants under two types of liposomes, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and presynaptic vesicle mimetic (Mimic) membranes. While neutrally charged DOPC membranes elicited marginal changes in the structure and amyloid fibrillation of SNs, negatively charged Mimic membranes induced dramatic helical folding and biphasic amyloid generation. At low concentration of Mimic membranes, the amyloid fibrillation of SNs was promoted in a dose-dependent manner. However, further increases in the concentration constrained the fibrillation process. These results suggest the dual effect of Mimic membranes on regulating the amyloidogenesis of SN, which is rationalized by the amyloidogenic structure of SN and condensation-dilution of local SN concentration. Finally, we propose physicochemical properties of SN and membrane surfaces, and their propensity to drive electrostatic interactions as decisive factors of amyloidogenesis.",

They have improved the cost-effectiveness of genotyping hundreds of individuals by using combinatorially-barcoded adapters. These strategies, however, can potentially misassign reads to incorrect samples. Here we used a modified quaddRAD protocol to analyse the occurrence of index hopping and PCR chimeras in a series of experiments with up to a 100 multiplexed samples per sequencing lane (total n = 639). We created two types of sequencing libraries: four libraries of Type A, where PCR reactions were run on individual samples before multiplexing, and three libraries of Type B, where PCRs were run on pooled samples. We used fixed pairs of inner barcodes to identify chimeric reads. Type B libraries show a higher percentage of misassigned reads (1.15%) compared to Type A libraries (0.65%). We also quantify the commonly undetectable chimeric sequences that occur whenever multiplexed groups of samples with different outer barcodes are sequenced together on a single flow cell. Our results suggest that these types of chimeric sequences represent up to 1.56% and 1.29% of reads in Type A and B libraries, respectively. We review the source of such errors, provide recommendations for developing highly-multiplexed RAD-seq protocols and analysing the resulting data to minimise the generation of chimeric sequences, allow their quantification, and provide finer control over the number of PCR cycles necessary to generate enough input DNA for library preparation.",

P-acquisition by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and their impacts on SOM decomposition may become even more relevant in these conditions. Yet, experimental evidence of the interactive effect of AM fungi and P availability influencing altered SOM cycling under eCO2 is scarce and the mechanisms of this control are poorly understood. Here, we performed a pot experiment manipulating P availability, AM fungal presence and atmospheric CO2 levels and assessed their impacts on soil C cycling and plant growth. Plants were grown in chambers with a continuous 13C-input that allowed differentiation between plant- and SOM-derived fractions of respired CO2 (R), dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass (MBC) as relevant C pools in the soil C cycle. We hypothesised that under low P availability, increases in SOM cycling may support sustained plant growth under eCO2 and that AM fungi would intensify this effect. We found the impacts of CO2 enrichment and P availability on soil C cycling were generally independent of each other with higher root biomass and slight increases in soil C cycling under eCO2 occurring regardless of the P treatment. Contrary to our hypotheses, soil C cycling was enhanced with P addition suggesting that low P conditions were limiting soil C cycling. eCO2 conditions increased the fraction of SOM-derived DOC pointing to increased SOM decomposition with eCO2. Finally, AM fungi increased microbial biomass under eCO2 conditions and low-P without enhanced soil C cycling, probably due to competitive interactions with free-living microorganisms over nutrients. Our findings in this plant-soil system suggest that, contrary to what has been reported for N-limited systems, the impacts of eCO2 and P availability on soil C cycling are independent of each other.",

Due to the extensive number of mutations, this variant has high level of immune evasion, which drastically reduced the efficacy of existing antibodies and vaccines. Thus, it is important to test an Omicron-specific vaccine, evaluate its immune response against Omicron and other variants, and compare its immunogenicity as boosters with existing vaccine designed against the reference wildtype virus (WT). Here, we generated an Omicron-specific lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA vaccine candidate, and tested its activity in animals, both alone and as a heterologous booster to existing WT mRNA vaccine. Our Omicron-specific LNP-mRNA vaccine elicited strong and specific antibody response in vaccination-naive mice. Mice that received two-dose WT LNP-mRNA, the one mimicking the commonly used Pfizer/Moderna mRNA vaccine, showed a >40-fold reduction in neutralization potency against Omicron variant than that against WT two weeks post second dose, which further reduced to background level >3 months post second dose. As a booster shot for two-dose WT mRNA vaccinated mice, a single dose of either a homologous booster with WT LNP-mRNA or a heterologous booster with Omicron LNP-mRNA restored the waning antibody response against Omicron, with over 40-fold increase at two weeks post injection as compared to right before booster. Interestingly, the heterologous Omicron LNP-mRNA booster elicited neutralizing titers 10-20 fold higher than the homologous WT booster against the Omicron variant, with comparable titers against the Delta variant. All three types of vaccination, including Omicron mRNA alone, WT mRNA homologous booster, and Omicron heterologous booster, elicited broad binding antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, Beta, and Delta variants, as well as other Betacoronavirus species such as SARS-CoV, but not Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These data provided direct proof-of-concept assessments of an Omicron-specific mRNA vaccination in vivo, both alone and as a heterologous booster to the existing widely-used WT mRNA vaccine form.",

Genetic assignment can be achieved with different types of molecular markers, but technical advantages and cost saving are recently promoting the shift from short tandem repeats (STRs) to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we designed, developed, and tested a small panel of SNPs for cost-effective geographic assignment of individuals with unknown origin of the endangered Mediterranean tortoise Testudo hermanni. We started by performing a ddRAD-seq experiment on 70 wild individuals of T. hermanni from 38 locations. Results obtained using 3,182 SNPs are comparable to those previously obtained using STR markers in terms of genetic structure and power to identify the macro-area of origin. However, our SNPs revealed further insights into the substructure in Western populations, especially in Southern Italy. A small panel of highly informative SNPs was then selected and tested by genotyping 190 individuals using the KASP genotyping chemistry. All the samples from wild populations of known geographic origin were genetically re-assigned with high accuracy to the original population. This reduced SNPs panel represents an efficient molecular tool that enables individuals to be genotyped at low cost (less than {euro}15 per sample) for geographical assignment and identification of hybrids. This information is crucial for the management in-situ of confiscated animals and their possible re-allocation in the wild. Our methodological pipeline can easily be extended to other species.",

However, a specific tool for computing similarity based on high resolution genome-wide copy number profiles is lacking. Here, we present CNpare, which identifies similar cell line models based on genome-wide DNA copy number. CNpare compares copy number profiles using four different similarity metrics, quantifies the extent of genome differences between pairs, and facilitates comparison based on copy number signatures. CNpare incorporates a precomputed database of 1,170 human cancer cell line profiles for comparison. In an analysis of separate cultures of 304 cell line pairs, CNpare identified the matched lines in all cases. CNpare provides a powerful solution to the problem of selecting the best cell line models for cancer research, especially in the context of studying chromosomal instability.",

Viral gene overexpression screening identified the essential VZV tegument protein ORF9 as a cGAS antagonist. Ectopically and virally expressed ORF9 bound to endogenous cGAS. Confocal microscopy revealed co-localisation of cGAS and ORF9, which reduced the type I IFN response to transfected DNA. ORF9 and cGAS also interacted directly in a cell-free system and phase-separated together with DNA. Furthermore, ORF9 inhibited cGAMP production by cGAS. Taken together, we uncovered the importance of the cGAS/STING DNA sensing pathway for VZV recognition and identified a VZV immune antagonist that directly interferes with DNA sensing via cGAS.",

The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the BOLD signal - a neural marker of spontaneous brain activity during rest - was analyzed.\n\nAs has been shown before, in normally sighted controls we observed an increase in ALFF during rest with the eyes open compared to rest with eyes closed in visual association areas and in parietal cortex but a decrease in auditory and sensorimotor regions. In congenital cataract-reversal individuals, we found an increase of the amplitude of slow BOLD fluctuations in visual cortex during rest with eyes open compared to rest with eyes closed too but this increase was larger in amplitude than in normally sighted controls. At the same time, congenital cataract-reversal individuals lagged a similar increase in parietal regions and did not show the typical decrease of ALFF in auditory and sensorimotor cortex. Congenitally blind individuals displayed an overall higher amplitude in slow BOLD fluctuations in visual cortex compared to sighted individuals and compared to congenital cataract-reversal individuals in the eyes closed condition.\n\nHigher ALFF in visual cortex of congenital cataract-reversal individuals than in normally sighted controls during eyes open might indicate an altered excitatory-inhibitory balance of visual neural circuits. By contrast, the lower parietal increase and the missing downregulation in auditory and sensorimotor regions suggest a reduced influence of the visual system on multisensory and the remaining sensory systems after restoring sight in congenitally blind individuals. These results demonstrate a crucial dependence of multisensory neural networks on visual experience during a sensitive phase in human brain development.",

However, while the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) form a large portion of the mammalian genome, their biological functions are mostly poorly characterized in cancers. In this study, using a newly developed tool, SomaGene, we reanalyze de novo somatic point mutations from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) whole-genome sequencing data of 1,855 breast cancers. We identify 929 candidates of ncRNAs that are significantly and explicitly mutated in breast cancer samples. By integrating data from the ENCODE regulatory features and FANTOM5 expression atlas, we show that the candidate ncRNAs in breast cancer samples significantly enrich for active chromatin histone marks (1.9 times), CTCF binding sites (2.45 times), DNase accessibility (1.76 times), HMM predicted enhancers (2.26 times) and eQTL polymorphisms (1.77 times). Importantly, we show that the 929 ncRNAs contain a much higher level (3.64 times) of breast cancer-associated genome-wide association (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than genome-wide expectation. Such enrichment has not been seen with GWAS SNPs from other diseases. Using breast tissue related Hi-C data we then show that 82% of our candidate ncRNAs (1.9 times) significantly interact with the promoter of protein-coding genes, including previously known cancer-associated genes, suggesting the critical role for candidate ncRNA genes in activation of essential regulators of development and differentiation in breast cancer. We provide an extensive web-based resource (http://ncrna.ictic.sharif.edu), to communicate our results with the research community. Our list of breast cancer-specific ncRNA genes has the potential to provide a better understanding of the underlying genetic causes of breast cancer.

Our previous analysis of the opium poppy genome suggested the STORR gene fusion event occurred before a whole genome duplication event 7.2 million years ago. Here we use a combination of phylogenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, biochemical and genomic analysis to investigate the origin of the STORR gene fusion across the Papaveraceae family. The pro-morphinan/morphinan subclass of BIAs was present in a subset of 10 Papaver species including P. somniferum (opium poppy) and this correlated with the presence of the STORR gene fusion with one important exception. P. californicum does not produce morphinans but it does contain a STORR gene fusion that epimerizes (S)- to (R)-reticuline when heterologously expressed in yeast. The high similarity of the amino acid sequence linking the two modules of STORR along with phylogenetic gene tree analysis strongly suggests the gene fusion occurred only once and between 17-25 million years ago before the separation of P. californicum from the other Papaver species. We discovered that the most abundant BIA in P. californicum is (R)-glaucine, a member of the aporphine subclass of BIAs. Only the (S) isomer of this compound has previously been reported from nature. These results lead us to conclude that the function of the STORR gene fusion is not exclusive to morphinan production in the Papaveraceae.",

Here we undertake a comprehensive genetic analysis of how the major human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae responds to 20 antibiotics. We built a genome-wide atlas of drug susceptibility determinants and generate a genetic interaction network that connects cellular processes and genes of unknown function, which we show can be used as therapeutic targets. Pathway analysis reveals a genome-wide \"tolerome\", defined by cellular processes that can make a bacterium less susceptible, and often tolerant, in an antibiotic specific manner. Importantly, modulation of these processes confers fitness benefits during active infections under antibiotic selection. Moreover, screening of sequenced clinical isolates demonstrates that mutations in tolerome genes readily evolve and are frequently associated with resistant strains, indicating such mutations may be an important harbinger for the emergence of antibiotic resistance.",

    "preprint_abstract": "IntroductionAn emerging pre-clinical approach for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy is targeting the microRNA (miRNA) system. MiRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that suppress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Targeting miRNAs, which is possible using antisense oligonucleotide  antimiRs can produce broad effects on gene expression suited to the complex pathophysiology in temporal lobe epilepsy. Potent anti-seizure and disease- modifying effects have been reported for antimiRs targeting microRNA-134 (antimiR-134). To date, however, pre-clinical testing has been performed using in vitro cell cultures and rodent models. It is uncertain how well this approach will translate to the clinic. Here, we develop an antimiR testing platform in human brain tissue sections.\n\nMethodologyHuman brain specimens were obtained with consent from patients undergoing resective surgery to treat focal drug-resistant epilepsy. Neocortical specimens were submerged in modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), dissected for clinical neuropathological examination, and unused material transferred for sectioning. Individual tissue sections were incubated in oxygenated ACSF, containing either antimiR-134 or a non-targeting control antimiR, for 24 hours at room temperature. RNA integrity was assessed using BioAnalyzer processing, and individual miRNA levels measured using RT-qPCR.\n\nResultsACSF transport had no obvious impact on any clinical neurosurgical or neuropathological procedure and specimens were confirmed to be viable following this process. RNA was well- preserved by transportation of specimens in ACSF, with RNA integrity scores significantly higher than tissue transported without ACSF. AntimiR-134 mediated a specific and dose- dependent knockdown of miR-134 in human neocortical sections, with approximately 75% reduction of miR-134 at 1 {micro}M and 90% reduction at 3 {micro}M. These doses did not have off- target effects on expression of a selection of three other miRNAs (miR-10, miR-129 or miR- 132).\n\nSignificanceThis is the first demonstration of antimiR-134 effects in live human brain tissues. The findings lend further support to the preclinical development of miR-134 and offer a flexible platform for the pre-clinical testing of antimiRs, and other antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, in human brain.\n\nKey pointsO_LIASO antimiRs are promising treatments for pharmacoresistant epilepsy\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a pipeline to preserve live human neocortical brain specimens from people undergoing resective surgery\nC_LIO_LIRNA integrity was sufficient to measure miRNA levels in human brain tissues transported in modified ACSF\nC_LIO_LIIncubation of acute human neocortical specimens in antimiR-134 resulted in potent and specific reduction in miR-134 levels\nC_LIO_LIAcute human brain slices are a promising model for testing ASOs\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "The bitter taste, triggered via gustatory receptors, serves as an important natural defense against the ingestion of poisonous foods in animals, and the diversity of food diet is usually linked to an increase in the number of gustatory receptor genes. This has been especially observed in polyphagous insect species, such as noctuid species from the Spodoptera genus. However, the dynamic and physical mechanisms leading to these gene expansions and the evolutionary pressures behind them remain elusive. Among major drivers of genome dynamics are the transposable elements but, surprisingly, their potential role in insect gustatory receptors expansion has not been considered yet.\n\nIn this work, we hypothesized that transposable elements and possibly positive selection would be involved in the active dynamic of gustatory receptor evolution in Spodoptera spp. We first sequenced de novo the full 465Mb genome of S. littoralis, and manually annotated all chemosensory genes, including a large repertoire of 373 gustatory receptor genes (including 19 pseudogenes). We also improved the completeness of S. frugiperda and S. litura gustatory receptor repertoires. Then, we annotated transposable elements and revealed that a particular category of class I retrotransposons, the SINE transposons, was significantly enriched in the vicinity of gustatory receptor gene clusters, suggesting a transposon-mediated mechanism for the formation of these clusters. Selection pressure analyses indicated that positive selection within the gustatory receptor gene family is cryptic, only 7 receptors being identified as positively selected.\n\nAltogether, our data provide a new good quality Spodoptera genome, pinpoint interesting gustatory receptor candidates for further functional studies and bring valuable genomic information on the mechanisms of gustatory receptor expansions in polyphagous insect species.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Transition path ensemble is of special interest in reaction coordinate identification as it consists of reactive trajectories that start from the reactant state and end in the product one. As a theoretical framework for describing the transition path ensemble, the transition path theory has been introduced more than ten years ago and so far its applications have been only illustrated in several low-dimensional systems. Given the transition path ensemble, expressions for calculating flux, current (a vector field), and principal curve are derived here in the space of collective variables from the transition path theory and they are applicable to time-series obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of high-dimensional systems, i.e., the position coordinates as a function of time in the transition path ensemble. The connection of the transition path theory is made to a density-weighted average flux, a quantity proposed in a previous work to appraise the relevance of a coordinate to the reaction coordinate [W. Li, J. Chem. Phys. 156, 054117 (2022)]. Most importantly, as an extension of the existing quantities, time-lagged quantities such as flux and current are also proposed. The main insights and objects provided by these time-lagged quantities are illustrated in the application to the alanine peptide in vacuum.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Recent developments in neural interfaces enable the real-time and non-invasive tracking of motor neuron spiking activity. Such novel interfaces provide a promising basis for human motor augmentation by extracting potential high-dimensional control signals directly from the human nervous system. However, it is unclear how flexibly humans can control the activity of individual motor neurones to effectively increase the number of degrees-of-freedom available to coordinate multiple effectors simultaneously. Here, we provided human subjects (N=7) with real-time feedback on the discharge patterns of pairs of motor units (MUs) innervating a single muscle (tibialis anterior) and encouraged them to independently control the MUs by tracking targets in a 2D space. Subjects learned control strategies to achieve the target-tracking task for various combinations of MUs. These strategies rarely corresponded to a volitional control of independent input signals to individual MUs. Conversely, MU activation was consistent with a common input to the MU pair, while individual activation of the MUs in the pair was predominantly achieved by alterations in de-recruitment order that could be explained with history-dependent changes in motor neuron excitability. These results suggest that flexible MU control based on independent synaptic inputs to single MUs is not a simple to learn control strategy.",

It efficiently aligns images, detects beads, and corrects for confounding factors of the fluorescence signal, such as crosstalk and phasing. Furthermore, Optocoder employs supervised machine learning to strongly increase the number of matches between optically decoded and sequenced barcodes. We benchmark Optocoder using data from an in-house spatial transcriptomics platform, as well as from Slide-Seq(V2), and we show that it efficiently processes all datasets without modification.\n\nAvailabilityOptocoder is publicly available, open-source and provided as a stand-alone Python package on GitHub: https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/optocoder",

ClC-7, a Cl-/H+ antiporter responsible for lysosomal Cl- permeability, is a candidate to contribute to the acidification process as part of this \"counterion pathway\". The signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2 modulates lysosomal dynamics, including by regulating lysosomal ion channels, raising the possibility that it could contribute to lysosomal pH regulation. Here we demonstrate that depleting PI(3,5)P2 by inhibiting the PIKfyve kinase causes lysosomal hyperacidification, primarily via an effect on ClC-7. We further show that PI(3,5)P2 directly inhibits ClC-7 transport and that this inhibition is eliminated in a disease-causing gain-of-function ClC-7 mutation. Together these observations suggest an intimate role for ClC-7 in lysosomal pH regulation.",

The impact of CD4CTLs in immunity and the mechanisms controlling their generation, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we show that CD4CTLs abundantly differentiate during mouse infection with the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. CD4CTLs display parallel kinetics to Th1 cells in the spleen, mediate specific cytotoxicity against cells presenting pathogen-derived antigens and express immunoregulatory and/or exhaustion markers. We demonstrate that CD4CTL absolute numbers and activity are severely reduced in both Myd88-/- and Il18ra-/- mice. Of note, the infection of mixed-bone marrow chimeras revealed that WT but not Myd88-/- cells transcribe the CD4CTL gene signature and that Il18ra-/- and Myd88-/- CD4+ T cells phenocopy each other. Moreover, adoptive transfer of WT CD4+GzB+ T cells to infected Il18ra-/- mice extended their survival. Importantly, cells expressing the CD4CTL phenotype predominate among CD4+ T cells infiltrating the infected mouse cardiac tissue and are increased in the blood of Chagas patients, in which the frequency of CD4CTLs correlates with the severity of cardiomyopathy. Our findings describe CD4CTLs as a major player in immunity to a relevant human pathogen and disclose T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling as a key pathway controlling the magnitude of the CD4CTL response.",

Epidemiological studies have implicated that exposure to these antibiotic residues in food may be associated to childhood obesity. Herein, the effect of exposure to residual dose of tylosin--an antibiotic growth promoter--on host metabolism and gut microbiota was explored in vivo. Theoretical maximal daily intake (TMDI) doses of tylosin were found to facilitate high-fat diet-induced obesity, induce insulin resistance, and perturb the composition of gut microbiota in mice. The obesity-related phenotypes were transferrable to germ-free recipient mice, indicating that the effects of TMDI dose of tylosin on obesity and insulin resistance occurred mainly via alteration of the gut microbiota. Tylosin TMDI exposure restricted to early life, which is the critical period of gut microbiota development, altered the abundance of specific bacteria related to host metabolic homeostasis later in life. Moreover, early-life exposure to tylosin TMDI was sufficient to modify the ratio of primary to secondary bile acids, thereby inducing lasting metabolic consequences via the downstream FGF15 signaling pathway. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that exposure to very low dose of antibiotic residues, whether continuously or in early life, can exert long-lasting effects on host metabolism by altering gut microbiota and its metabolites.\n\nImportanceEvidence has indicated that chronic exposure to antibiotic residues in food could contribute to obesity. However, few studies have investigated the effect of chronic exposure to very low-dose antibiotic residue in food (~1000-fold lower than the therapeutic dose) on gut microbiota and host metabolism. Our study demonstrates that even with limited exposure in early life, a residual dose of tylosin causes lasting metabolic disturbances through altering gut microbiota and its metabolites.

Although Fbxo7 is an F-box protein that recruits substrates for SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, it also promotes the formation of cyclin D/Cdk6/p27 complexes in an E3-ligase independent fashion. We discovered PFKP, the major gatekeeper of glycolysis, in a screen for Fbxo7 substrates. PFKP has been previously shown to be a critical substrate of Cdk6 for the viability of T-ALL cells. We investigated the molecular relationships between Fbxo7, Cdk6 and PFKP, and the functional effect Fbxo7 has on T cell metabolism, viability, and activation. Fbxo7 promotes Cdk6-independent ubiquitination and Cdk6-dependent phosphorylation of PFKP. Importantly Fbxo7-deficient cells have reduced Cdk6 activity, and haematopoietic and lymphocytic cell lines show a significant dependency on Fbxo7. Compared to WT cells, CD4+ T cells with reduced Fbxo7 expression show increased glycolysis, despite lower cell viability and activation levels. Metabolomic studies of activated CD4+ T cells confirm increased glycolytic flux in Fbxo7-deficient cells, as well as altered nucleotide biosynthesis and arginine metabolism. We show Fbxo7 expression is glucose-responsive at the mRNA and protein level, and we propose Fbxo7 inhibits PFKP and glycolysis via its activation of Cdk6.",

Therefore, new ideas and approaches for treating this aggressive disease are essential to drive progress forward. Conventional therapies, such as radiation and Temozolomide (TMZ), function to cause oxidative stress and DNA damage yielding a senescent-like state of replicative arrest in susceptible cells. However, increasing evidence demonstrates malignant cells can escape senescence leading to tumor recurrence. Ablation of non-replicating senescent tumor cells after radiation and chemotherapy may be an avenue to reduce the rates of tumor recurrence. Senolytic agents have been developed that selectively target senescent cells, but it remains unknown whether senolytics might be utilized against senescent-like glioma cells. We employed radiation or TMZ to induce a functionally senescent state in human glioblastoma cells. Viable cells that survive these treatments were then utilized to screen candidate senolytic drugs, to identify those selectively effective at ablating senescent-like cells over naive non-tumor and proliferative cells. Among 10 candidate senolytic drugs evaluated, only Bcl-XL inhibitors demonstrated reproducible senolytic activity in radiated or TMZ-treated glioma across the majority of GBM cell lines evaluated. Conversely, Bcl-2 inhibitors and other established senolytic drugs failed to show any consistent senolytic activity. In agreement with these data, Bcl-XL knockdown selectively reduced the viability of senescent-like GBM cells, whereas knockdown of Bcl-2 or Bcl-W yielded no senolytic effect. These findings demonstrate the potential to harness radiation-induced biology to ablate latent surviving cells and highlight Bcl-XL dependency as a potential vulnerability of surviving GBM cells after exposure to radiation or TMZ.",

Additional activities have been ascribed to this enzyme in vitro: site-specific (cis) single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage and indiscriminate (trans) degradation of ssDNA, RNA, and dsDNA after activation by a complementary target. The ability of Cas12a to cleave nucleic acids indiscriminately has been harnessed for many applications, including diagnostics, but it remains unknown if it contributes to bacterial immunity. Here, we provide evidence that cleavage of ssDNA in cis or in trans by Cas12a is insufficient to impact immunity. Using LbCas12a expressed in either Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli, we observed that cleavage of dsDNA targets did not elicit cell death or dormancy, suggesting insignificant levels of collateral damage against host RNA or DNA. Canonical immunity against invasive dsDNA also had no impact on the replicative fitness of co-infecting ssDNA phage or plasmid in trans.

Overall, these results suggest that CRISPR-Cas12a immunity predominantly occurs via canonical targeting of dsDNA, and that the other activities are in vitro irregularities.",

How TMEM16F is activated during cell fusion is unclear. Here, we used trophoblasts as a model for cell fusion and demonstrated that Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid channel TRPV4 is critical for TMEM16F activation and subsequent human trophoblast fusion. GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 specific agonist, robustly activates TMEM16F in trophoblasts. Patch-clamp electrophysiology demonstrated that TRPV4 and TMEM16F are functionally coupled within Ca2+ microdomains in human trophoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of TRPV4 hindered TMEM16F activation and subsequent trophoblast syncytialization. Our study uncovers the functional expression of TRPV4 and a physiological activation mechanism of TMEM16F in human trophoblasts, thus providing us with novel strategies to regulate CaPLSase activity as a critical checkpoint of physiologically- and disease-relevant cell fusion events.",

Based on our previously obtained transcriptome data, we screened two WUSCHCEL-related homeobox (WOX) genes closely related to bulbil formation, LlWOX9 and LlWOX11. However, the biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 are unclear. In this study, we cloned the full-length coding sequences of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11. Transgenic Arabidopsis showed increased branch numbers, and the overexpression of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 in stem segments promoted bulbil formation, while the silencing of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 inhibited bulbil formation, indicating that LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 are positive regulators of bulbil formation. Cytokinins acting through type-B response regulators (type-B RRs) could bind to the promoters of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 and promote their transcription. LlWOX11 could enhance cytokinin pathway signalling by inhibiting the transcription of type-A LlRR9. Our study enriches the understanding of the regulation of plant development by the WOX gene family and lays a foundation for further research on the molecular mechanism of bulbil formation in lily.",

In the past several years, smallholder and commercial cultivation of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), a global cereal and forage crop, has been threatened by a global outbreak of an aggressive new biotype of sugarcane aphid (SCA; Melanaphis sacchari). Here we characterized genomic signatures of adaptation in a Haitian sorghum breeding population, which had been recently founded from admixed global germplasm, extensively intercrossed, and subjected to intense selection under SCA infestation. We conducted evolutionary population genomics analyses of 296 post-selection Haitian lines compared to 767 global accessions at 159,683 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Despite intense selection, the Haitian population retains high nucleotide diversity through much of the genome due to diverse founders and an intercrossing strategy. A genome-wide fixation (FST) scan and geographic analyses suggests that adaptation to SCA in Haiti is conferred by a globally-rare East African allele of RMES1, which has also spread to other breeding programs in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. De novo genome sequencing data for SCA resistant and susceptible lines revealed putative causative variants at RMES1. Convenient low-cost markers were developed from the RMES1 selective sweep and successfully predicted resistance in independent U.S. x African breeding lines and eight U.S. commercial and public breeding programs, demonstrating the global relevance of the findings. Together, the findings highlight the potential of evolutionary genomics to develop adaptive trait breeding technology and the value of global germplasm exchange to facilitate evolutionary rescue.",

The caspase-hemoglobinase fold has been conserved throughout nearly one billion years of evolution and is utilized for both the monomeric and dimeric subfamilies of apoptotic caspases, called initiator and effector caspases, respectively. We compared the folding and assembly of procaspase-3b from zebrafish to that of human effector procaspases in order to examine the conservation of the folding landscape. Urea-induced equilibrium folding/unfolding of procaspase-3b showed a minimum three-state folding pathway, where the native dimer isomerizes to a partially folded dimeric intermediate, which then unfolds. A partially folded monomeric intermediate observed in the folding landscape of human procaspase-3 is not well-populated in zebrafish procaspase-3b. By comparing effector caspases from different species, we show that the effector procaspase dimer undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change, and that the conformational species in the folding landscape exhibit similar free energies. Together, the data show that the landscape for the caspase-hemoglobinase fold is conserved, yet it provides flexibility for species-specific stabilization or destabilization of folding intermediates resulting in changes in stability. The common pH-dependent conformational change in the native dimer, which yields an enzymatically inactive species, may provide an additional, albeit reversible, mechanism for controlling caspase activity in the cell.",

    "preprint_abstract": "ObjectiveIn hepatocytes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) acts as a lipid sensor that regulates hepatic lipid catabolism during fasting and orchestrates a genomic response required for whole-body homeostasis. This includes the biosynthesis of ketone bodies and the secretion of the starvation hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Several lines of evidence suggest that adipose tissue lipolysis contributes to this specific process. However, whether adipose tissue lipolysis is a dominant signal for the extensive remodeling of liver gene expression dependent on PPAR has not been investigated.\n\nMethodsFirst, using mice lacking adipose tissue lipolysis through adipocyte-specific deletion of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), we characterized the responses dependent on adipocyte ATGL during fasting. Next, we performed liver whole genome expression analysis in fasted mice upon deletion of adipocyte ATGL or hepatocyte PPAR. Finally, we tested the consequences of hepatocyte-specific PPAR deficiency during pharmacological induction of adipocyte lipolysis with a {beta}3-adrenergic receptor agonist.\n\nResultsIn the absence of ATGL in adipocytes, ketone body and FGF21 productions were impaired in response to starvation. Liver transcriptome analysis revealed that adipocyte ATGL is critical for regulation of hepatic gene expression during fasting and highlighted a strong enrichment in PPAR target genes in this condition. Genome expression analysis confirmed that a large set of fasting-induced genes are sensitive to both ATGL and PPAR. Adipose tissue lipolysis induced by acute activation of the {beta}3-adrenergic receptor also triggered PPAR-dependent responses in the liver, supporting a role for adipocyte-derived fatty acids as dominant signals for hepatocyte PPAR activity. In addition, the absence of hepatocyte PPAR altered brown adipose tissue (BAT) morphology and reduced UCP1 expression upon stimulation of the {beta}3-adrenergic receptor. In agreement with this finding, mice lacking hepatocyte PPAR showed decreased tolerance to acute cold exposure.\n\nConclusionsThese results underscore the central role of hepatocyte PPAR in the sensing of adipocyte-derived fatty acids and reveal that its activity is essential for full activation of BAT. Intact PPAR activity in hepatocytes is required for cross-talk between adipose tissues and the liver during fat mobilization during fasting and cold exposure.",

However, whether and how TET1 exerts catalytic activity-independent functions in regulating bivalent genes is not well understood. Using a proteomics approach, we mapped the TET1 interactome in mouse ESCs and identified PSPC1 as a novel TET1 partner. Genome-wide location analysis reveals that PSPC1 functionally associates with TET1 and Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) complex. We establish that PSPC1 and TET1 repress, and Neat1, the PSPC1 cognate lncRNA, activates the bivalent gene expression. In ESCs, Neat1 tethers the TET1-PSPC1 pair with PRC2 at bivalent promoters. During the ESC-to-formative epiblast-like stem cell (EpiLC) transition, PSPC1 and TET1 promote PRC2 chromatin occupancy at bivalent gene promoters while restricting Neat1 functions in facilitating PRC2 binding to bivalent gene transcripts. Our study uncovers a novel TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis that modulates PRC2 binding affinity to chromatin and bivalent gene transcripts in controlling stem cell bivalency.\n\nIn BriefTET1 is a transcriptional repressor for bivalent genes in pluripotent stem cells, but its mechanistic action on stem cell bivalency is unclear.

    "preprint_abstract": "Early marine invertebrates like the Branchiopoda began their sojourn into dilute media some 500 million years ago in the Middle Cambrian. Others like the Mollusca, Annelida and many crustacean taxa have followed, accompanying major marine transgressions and regressions, shifting landmasses, orogenies and glaciations. In adapting to these events and new habitats such invertebrates acquired novel physiological abilities that attenuate the ion loss and water gain that constitute severe challenges to life in dilute media. Among these taxon-specific adaptations, selected from the subcellular to organismal levels of organization, are reduced body permeability and surface (S) to volume (V) ratios, lowered osmotic gradients, increased surface areas of interface epithelia, relocation of membrane proteins in ion-transporting cells and augmented transport enzyme abundance, activity and affinity. We examine adaptations in taxa that have penetrated into fresh water, revealing diversified modifications, a consequence of distinct body plans, morpho-physiological resources and occupation routes. Contingent on life history and reproductive strategy, numerous patterns of osmotic regulation have emerged, including intracellular isosmotic regulation in weak hyper-regulators and well-developed anisosmotic extracellular regulation in strong hyper-regulators, likely reflecting inertial adaptations to early life in an estuarine environment. Our analyses show that across sixty-four freshwater invertebrate species from six phyla/classes, hemolymph osmolalities decrease logarithmically with increasing S: V ratios. The arthropods have the highest osmolalities, from 300 to 650 mOsmoles/kg H2O in the Decapoda with 220 to 320 mOsmoles/kg H2O in the Insecta; osmolalities in the Annelida range from 150 to 200 mOsmoles/kg H2O, the Mollusca showing the lowest osmolalities at 40 to 120 mOsmoles/kg H2O. Overall, osmolalities reach a cut-off at {approx}200 mOsmoles/kg H2O, independently of increasing S: V ratio. The ability of species with small S: V ratios to maintain large osmotic gradients is mirrored in their putatively higher Na+/K+-ATPase activities that drive ion uptake processes. Selection pressures on these morpho-physiological characteristics have led to differential osmoregulatory abilities, rendering possible the conquest of fresh water while retaining some tolerance of the ancestral medium.",

Current guidelines for DNT testing are notably costly, time consuming, and unsuitable for testing large numbers of chemicals. Therefore, there is a need for adequate alternatives to conventional animal testing for neurotoxicity and DNT. Here we show that detailed kinematic analysis can provide a strong indicator for DNT, using known (chlorpyrifos, CPS) or putative ({beta}-N-methylamino-L-alanine, BMAA) neurotoxic compounds. We exposed Drosophila melanogaster to these compounds during development and evaluated for common general toxicity -- notably developmental survival and pupal positioning, together with the FlyWalker system, a detailed adult kinematics evaluation method.\n\nAt concentrations that do not induce general toxicity, the solvent DMSO had a significant effect on kinematic parameters. Nonetheless, CPS not only induced developmental lethality but also significantly impaired coordination in comparison to DMSO, altering 16 motor parameters, validating the usefulness of our kinematic approach.\n\nInterestingly, BMAA, although not lethal during development, induced a dose-dependent motor decay, targeting most parameters in young adult animals, phenotypically resembling normally aged, non-exposed flies. This effect was subsequently attenuated during ageing, indicating an adaptive response. Furthermore, BMAA induced an abnormal terminal differentiation of leg motor neurons, without inducing degeneration, underpinning the observed altered mobility phenotype. Overall, our results support our kinematic approach as a novel, highly sensitive and reliable tool to assess potential DNT of chemical compounds.",

The integrative multi-platform analyses based on genome-wide RNA sequencing, methylation, copy number variations, and whole exome sequencing identified over 100 dysregulated canonical pathways involving immunity, tissue differentiation and transformation as initiators of bladder carcinogenesis. Widespread dysregulation of interleukin signaling was the dominant change signifying the important role of inflammation and immunity in the incipient phases of urothelial carcinogenesis. The analyses of mutational patterns identified three types of mutations based on their geographic distribution and variant allele frequencies. The most common were low frequency subclonal mutations restricted to individual mucosal samples which were the progeny of their respective uroprogenitor cells. The two additional types of mutations were associated with clonal expansion and involved large areas of bladder mucosa. The first group referred to as  mutations, showed a low mutational frequency across the mucosa. The second group referred to as {beta} mutations increased in their frequencies with disease progression and a large proportion of them represented mutated transcriptional regulators controlling proliferation. Time modeling revealed that bladder carcinogenesis is spanning 10-15 years and can be divided into dormant and progressive phases. The progressive phase lasted 1-2 years and was primarily driven by {beta} mutations with high proliferative advantage. This is the first detailed molecular characterization of mucosal field effects initiating bladder carcinogenesis on the whole-organ scale. It provides novel insights into incipient phases of bladder carcinogenesis and biomarkers for early detection of bladder cancer as well as targets for preventive therapies.",

Since September 2021, an out-of-season HPIV3 rebound has been noted in Korea. The objective of this study was to analyze the molecular characteristics of the HPIV3 strains responsible for the outbreak in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nMethodsA total of 61 HPIV3-positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected between October and November 2021. Using 33 HPIV3-positive specimens, partial nucleotide sequences of the HPIV3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene were aligned with previously published HN gene sequences for phylogenetic and genetic distance (p-distance) analyses.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic tree revealed that all Seoul HPIV3 strains grouped within the phylogenetic subcluster C3. However, these strains formed a unique cluster that branched separately from the C3a lineage. This cluster showed 99% bootstrap support with a p-distance < 0.001. Genetic distances within the other C3 lineages ranged from 0.013 (C3a) to 0.023 (C3c). Deduced amino acid sequences of the HN gene revealed four protein substitutions in Seoul HPIV3 strains that have rarely been observed in other reference strains: A22T, K31N, G387S, and E514K.\n\nConclusionsPhylogenetic analysis of Seoul HPIV3 strains revealed that the strain belonged to a separate cluster within subcluster C3. Genetic distances among strains within subcluster C3 suggest the emergence of a new genetic lineage. The emergence of a new genetic lineage could pose a potential risk of a new epidemic. Further monitoring of the circulating HPIV3 strains is needed to understand the importance of newly discovered mutations.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundTranscription factor (TF) regulates the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA by binding to upstream sequence motifs. Identifying the locations of known motifs in whole genomes is computationally intensive.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThis study presents a computational tool, named \"Grit\", for screening TF-binding sites (TFBS) by coordinating transcription factors to their promoter sequences in orthologous genes. This tool employs a newly developed mixed Students t-test statistical method that detects high-scoring conserved and non-conserved binding sites among species. The program performs sequence scanning at a rate of 3.2 Mb/s on a quad-core Amazon server and has been benchmarked by the well-established ChIP-Seq datasets, putting Grit amongst the top-ranked TFBS predictors. It marginally outperforms the well-known transcription factor motif scanning tools, Pscan (4.8%) and FIMO (17.8%), in analyzing well-documented ChIP-Atlas human genome Chip-Seq datasets.\n\nSignificanceGrit is a good alternative to current available motif scanning tools and is publicly available at http://www.thua45.cn/grit under an academic free license.\n\nAuthor SummaryLocating transcription factor-binding (TF-binding) site in the genome and identification their function is fundamental in understanding various biological processes. Improve the performance of the prediction tools is important because accurate TF-binding site prediction can save cost and time for wet-lab experiments. Also, genome wide TF-binding site prediction can provide new insights for transcriptome regulation in system biology perspective. This study developed a new TF-binding site prediction tool based on mixed Students t-test statistical method. The tool is amongst the top-ranked TF-binding site predictors, as such, it can help the researchers in TF-binding site identification and transcriptional regulation mechanism interpretation of genes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Photoreceptor degeneration leads to irreversible vision loss in humans with retinal dystrophies such as Retinitis Pigmentosa. Whereas photoreceptor loss is permanent in mammals, zebrafish possesses the ability to regenerate retinal neurons and restore visual function. Following acute damage, Muller glia (MG) re-enter the cell cycle and produce multipotent progenitors whose progeny differentiate into mature neurons. Both MG reprogramming and proliferation of retinal progenitor cells require reactive microglia and associated inflammatory signaling. Paradoxically, MG in zebrafish models of photoreceptor degeneration fail to re-enter the cell cycle and regenerate lost cells. Here, we used the zebrafish cep290 mutant to demonstrate that progressive cone degeneration generates an immune response but does not stimulate MG proliferation. Acute light damage triggered photoreceptor regeneration in cep290 mutants but cones were only restored to pre-lesion densities. Using irf8 mutant zebrafish, we found that the chronic absence of microglia reduced inflammation and rescued cone degeneration in cep290 mutants. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed sustained expression of notch3 in MG of cep290 mutants and inhibition of Notch signaling induced MG to re-enter the cell cycle. Our findings provide new insights on the requirements for MG to proliferate and the potential for immunosuppression to prolong photoreceptor survival.",

Consistent with expectations, and potentially owing to their low thermal inertia, water shrews had a significantly higher diving metabolic rate in 10{degrees}C (8.77 mL O2 g-1 hr-1) compared to 30{degrees}C water (6.57 mL O2 g-1 hr-1). Unlike larger-bodied divers, muscle myoglobin contributed minimally (7.7-12.4%) to total onboard O2 stores of juvenile and adult water shrews, respectively, but was offset by high blood O2 carrying capacities (26.4-26.9 vol. %). Diving was predominantly aerobic, as only 1.2-2.3% of dives in 10 and 30{degrees}C water, respectively, exceeded the calculated aerobic dive limits at these temperatures (10.8-14.4 sec). The mean voluntary dive time of water shrews during 20-min trials in 3-30{degrees}C water was 5.0{+/-}0.1 sec (N=25, n=1628), with a mean maximum dive time of 10.1{+/-}0.4 sec. However, the average dive duration (6.9{+/-}0.2 sec, n=257) of radio-telemetered shrews exclusively foraging in a simulated riparian environment (3{degrees}C water) for 12- to 28-hr suggest that mean (but not maximum) dive times of water shrews in the wild may be longer. Mean dive duration, duration of the longest dive, and total time in water all decreased significantly as water temperature declined, suggesting that shrews employed behavioral thermoregulation to defend against immersion hypothermia. Additionally, free-diving shrews in the 24-hr trials consistently elevated core body temperature by [~]1{degrees}C immediately prior to initiating aquatic foraging bouts, and ended these bouts when body temperature was still at or above normal resting levels ([~]37.8{degrees}C). We suggest this observed pre-dive hyperthermia aids to heighten the impressive somatosensory physiology, and hence foraging efficiency, of this diminutive predator while submerged.",

Despite this, nuclear genome assemblies have been under-represented for agricultural insect pests, particularly from the order Coleoptera. Here we present a de novo genome assembly and structural annotation for the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read data generated from a wild-caught female, as well as the assembly process that also led to the recovery of the complete circular genome assemblies of the beetles mitochondrial genome and that of the biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). As an invasive pest of palm trees, O. rhinoceros is undergoing an expansion in its range across the Pacific Islands, requiring new approaches to management that may include strategies facilitated by genome assembly and annotation.\n\nResultsHigh-quality DNA isolated from an adult female was used to create four ONT libraries that were sequenced using four MinION flow cells, producing a total of 27.2 Gb of high-quality long-read sequences. We employed an iterative assembly process and polishing with one lane of high-accuracy Illumina reads, obtaining a final size of the assembly of 377.36 Mb that had high contiguity (fragment N50 length = 12 Mb) and accuracy, as evidenced by the exceptionally high completeness of the benchmarked set of conserved single-copy orthologous genes (BUSCO completeness = 99.11%). These quality metrics place our assembly as the most complete of the published Coleopteran genomes. The structural annotation of the nuclear genome assembly contained a highly-accurate set of 16,371 protein-coding genes showing BUSCO completeness of 92.09%, as well as the expected number of non-coding RNAs and the number and structure of paralogous genes in a gene family like Sigma GST.\n\nConclusionsThe genomic resources produced in this study form a foundation for further functional genetic research and management programs that may inform the control and surveillance of O. rhinoceros populations, and we demonstrate the efficacy of de novo genome assembly using long-read ONT data from a single field-caught insect.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Embryonic development results in the production of distinct tissue types, and different cell types within each tissue. A major goal of developmental biology is to uncover the \"parts list\" of cell types that comprise each organ. Here we perform single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the Drosophila embryo to identify the genes that characterize different cell and tissue types during development. We assay three different timepoints, revealing a coordinated change in gene expression within each tissue. Interestingly, we find that the elav and mhc genes, whose protein products are widely used as markers for neurons and muscles, respectively, show broad pan-embryonic expression, indicating the importance of post-transcriptional regulation. We next focus on the central nervous system (CNS), where we identify genes characterizing each stage of neuronal differentiation: from neural progenitors, called neuroblasts, to their immediate progeny ganglion mother cells (GMCs), followed by new-born neurons, young neurons, and the most mature neurons. Finally, we ask whether the clonal progeny of a single neuroblast (NB7-1) share a similar transcriptional identity. Surprisingly, we find that clonal identity does not lead to transcriptional clustering, showing that neurons within a lineage are diverse, and that neurons with a similar transcriptional profile (e.g. motor neurons, glia) are distributed among multiple neuroblast lineages. Although each lineage consists of diverse progeny, we were able to identify a previously uncharacterized gene, Fer3, as an excellent marker for the NB7-1 lineage. Within the NB7-1 lineage, transcriptional clusters are identifiable in neuroblasts and neurons, and each cluster is composed of current temporal transcription factor (e.g. Hunchback, Kruppel, Pdm, and Castor), novel temporal factors, and/or targets of the temporal transcription factors. In conclusion, we have characterized the embryonic transcriptome for all major tissue types and for three stages of development, as well as the first transcriptomic analysis of a single, identified neuroblast lineage, finding a lineage-enriched transcription factor.",

These data may come from from simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model or from laboratory current clamp experiments. In each case the reduced dimension data driven forecasting (DDF) models are shown to predict accurately for times after the training period.\n\nWhen the available observations for neuron preparations are, for example, membrane voltage V(t) only, we use the technique of time delay embedding from nonlinear dynamics to generate an appropriate space in which the full dynamics can be realized.\n\nThe DDF constructions are reduced dimension models relative to HH models as they are built on and forecast only observables such as V(t). They do not require detailed specification of ion channels, their gating variables, and the many parameters that accompany an HH model for laboratory measurements, yet all of this important information is encoded in the DDF model.\n\nAs the DDF models use only voltage data and forecast only voltage data, they can be used in building networks with biophysical connections. Both gap junction connections and ligand gated synaptic connections among neurons involve presynaptic voltages and induce postsynaptic voltage response. Biophysically based DDF neuron models can replace other reduced dimension neuron models, say of the integrate-and-fire type, in developing and analyzing large networks of neurons.\n\nWhen one does have detailed HH model neurons for network components, a reduced dimension DDF realization of the HH voltage dynamics may be used in network computations to achieve computational efficiency and the exploration of larger biological networks.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Human perception and experience of time is strongly influenced by ongoing stimulation, memory of past experiences, and required task context. When paying attention to time, time experience seems to expand; when distracted, it seems to contract. When considering time based on memory, the experience may be different than in the moment, exemplified by sayings like \"time flies when youre having fun\". Experience of time also depends on the content of perceptual experience - rapidly changing or complex perceptual scenes seem longer in duration than less dynamic ones. The complexity of interactions between attention, memory, and perceptual stimulation is a likely reason that an overarching theory of time perception has been difficult to achieve. Here, we introduce a model of perceptual processing and episodic memory that makes use of hierarchical predictive coding, short-term plasticity, spatio-temporal attention, and episodic memory formation and recall, and apply this model to the problem of human time perception. In an experiment with ~ 13, 000 human participants we investigated the effects of memory, cognitive load, and stimulus content on duration reports of dynamic natural scenes up to ~ 1 minute long. Using our model to generate duration estimates, we compared human and model performance. Model-based estimates replicated key qualitative biases, including differences by cognitive load (attention), scene type (stimulation), and whether the judgement was made based on current or remembered experience (memory). Our work provides a comprehensive model of human time perception and a foundation for exploring the computational basis of episodic memory within a hierarchical predictive coding framework.\n\nAuthor summaryExperience of the duration of present or past events is a central aspect of human experience, the underlying mechanisms of which are not yet fully understood. In this work, we combine insights from machine learning and neuroscience to propose a combination of mathematical models that replicate human perceptual processing, long-term memory, attention, and duration perception. Our computational implementation of this framework can process information from video clips of ordinary life scenes, record and recall important events, and report the duration of these clips. To assess the validity of our proposal, we conducted an experiment with ~ 13, 000 human participants. Each was shown a video between 1-64 seconds long and reported how long they believed it was. Reports of duration by our computational model qualitatively matched these human reports, made about the exact same videos. This was true regardless of the video content, whether time was actively judged or based on memory of the video, or whether the participants focused on a single task or were distracted - all factors known to influence human time perception. Our work provides the first model of human duration perception to incorporate these diverse and complex factors and provides a basis to probe the deep links between memory and time in human experience.",

How does the sensory modality of symbols (tactile vs. visual) influence their neural representations? We examined these questions by comparing reading of visual print (sighted group, n=19) and tactile Braille (congenitally blind group, n=19). Blind and sighted readers were presented with written (words, consonant strings, non-letter shapes) and spoken stimuli (words, backward speech) that varied in word-likeness. Consistent with prior work, the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC) was active during Braille and visual reading. A posterior/anterior vOTC word-form gradient was observed only in sighted readers with more anterior regions preferring larger orthographic units (words). No such gradient was observed in blind readers. Consistent with connectivity predictions, in blind compared to sighted readers, posterior parietal cortices were recruited to a greater degree and contained word-preferring patches. Lateralization of Braille in blind readers was predicted by laterality of spoken language and reading hand. The effect of spoken language increased along a cortical hierarchy, whereas effect of reading-hand waned. These results suggested that the neural basis of reading is influenced by symbol modality and spoken language and support connectivity-based views of cortical function.",

Administration of amniotic fluid stem cell extracellular vesicles (AFSC-EVs) rescues branching morphogenesis in rodent fetal models of pulmonary hypoplasia. Herein, we hypothesized that AFSC-EVs exert their regenerative potential by affecting autophagy, a process required for normal lung development.\n\nObjectivesTo evaluate autophagy in hypoplastic lungs throughout gestation and establish whether AFSC-EV administration improves branching morphogenesis through autophagy-mediated mechanisms.\n\nMethodsEVs were isolated from c-kit+ AFSC conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation and characterized for size, morphology, and EV markers. Branching morphogenesis was inhibited in rat fetuses by nitrofen administration to dams and in human fetal lung explants by blocking RAC1 activity with NSC23766. Expression of autophagy activators (BECN1 and ATG5) and adaptor (SQSTM1/p62) was analyzed in vitro (rat and human fetal lung explants) and in vivo (rat fetal lungs). Mechanistic studies on rat fetal primary lung epithelial cells were conducted using inhibitors for microRNA-17 and -20a contained in the AFSC-EV cargo and known to regulate autophagy.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsRat and human models of fetal pulmonary hypoplasia showed reduced autophagy mainly at pseudoglandular and canalicular stages. AFSC-EV administration restored autophagy in both pulmonary hypoplasia models by transferring miR-17[~]92 cluster members contained in the EV cargo.\n\nConclusionsAFSC-EV treatment rescues branching morphogenesis partly by restoring autophagy through miRNA cargo transfer. This study enhances our understanding of pulmonary hypoplasia pathogenesis and creates new opportunities for fetal therapeutic intervention in CDH babies.",

We used photoacoustic imaging to investigate the injection site dynamics of dye-labeled insulin lispro in the Humalog(R) and Lyumjev(R) formulations using the murine ear cutaneous model and correlated it with results from unlabeled insulin lispro in pig subcutaneous injection model.\n\nMethodsWe employed dual-wavelength optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy to study the absorption and diffusion of the near-infrared dye-labeled insulin lispro in the Humalog and Lyumjev formulations in mouse ears. We mathematically modeled the experimental data to calculate the absorption rate constants and diffusion coefficients. We studied the pharmacokinetics of the unlabeled insulin lispro in both the Humalog and Lyumjev formulations as well as a formulation lacking both the zinc and phenolic preservative in pigs. The association state of insulin lispro in each of the formulations was characterized using SV-AUC and NMR spectroscopy.\n\nResultsThrough experiments using murine and swine models, we show that the hexamer dissociation rate of insulin lispro is not the absorption rate-limiting step. We demonstrated that the excipients in the Lyumjev formulation produce local tissue expansion and speed both insulin diffusion and microvascular absorption. We also show that the diffusion of insulin lispro at the injection site drives its initial absorption; however, the rate at which the insulin lispro crosses the blood vessels is its overall absorption rate-limiting step.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides insights into injection site dynamics of insulin lispro and the impact of formulation excipients.

    "preprint_abstract": "Ventral temporal cortex (VTC) consists of high-level visual regions that are arranged in consistent anatomical locations across individuals. This consistency has led to several hypotheses about the factors that constrain the functional organization of VTC. A prevailing theory is that white matter connections influence the organization of VTC, however, the nature of this constraint is unclear. Here, we test two hypotheses: (1) white matter tracts are specific for each category or (2) white matter tracts are specific to cytoarchitectonic areas of VTC. To test these hypotheses, we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to identify white matter tracts and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify category-selective regions in VTC in children and adults. We find that in childhood, white matter connections are linked to cytoarchitecture rather than category-selectivity. In adulthood, however, white matter connections are linked to both cytoarchitecture and category-selectivity. These results suggest a rethinking of the view that category-selective regions in VTC have category-specific white matter connections early in development. Instead, these findings suggest that the neural hardware underlying the processing of categorical stimuli may be more domain-general than previously thought, particularly in childhood.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundImplantable neuroprostheses consisting of a central electronic unit wired to electrodes benefit thousands of patients worldwide. However, they present limitations that restrict their use. Those limitations, which are more adverse in motor neuroprostheses, mostly arise from their bulkiness and the need to perform complex surgical implantation procedures. Alternatively, it has been proposed the development of distributed networks of intramuscular wireless microsensors and microstimulators that communicate with external systems for analyzing neuromuscular activity and performing stimulation or controlling external devices. This paradigm requires the development of miniaturized implants that can be wirelessly powered and operated by an external system. To accomplish this, we propose a wireless power transfer (WPT) and communications approach based on volume conduction of innocuous high frequency (HF) current bursts. The currents are applied through external textile electrodes and are collected by the wireless devices through two electrodes for powering and bidirectional digital communications. As these devices do not require bulky components for obtaining power, they may have a flexible threadlike conformation, facilitating deep implantation by injection.\n\nMethodsWe report the design and evaluation of advanced prototypes based on the above approach. The system consists of an external unit, floating semi-implantable devices for sensing and stimulation, and a bidirectional communications protocol. The devices are intended for their future use in acute human trials to demonstrate the distributed paradigm. The technology is assayed in vitro using an agar phantom, and in vivo in hindlimbs of anesthetized rabbits.\n\nResultsThe semi-implantable devices were able to power and bidirectionally communicate with the external unit. Using 13 commands modulated in innocuous 3 MHz HF current bursts, the external unit configured the sensing and stimulation parameters, and controlled their execution. Raw EMG was successfully acquired by the wireless devices at 1 ksps.\n\nConclusionsThe demonstrated approach overcomes key limitations of existing neuroprostheses, paving the way to the development of distributed flexible threadlike sensors and stimulators. To the best of our knowledge, these devices are the first based on WPT by volume conduction that can work as EMG sensors and as electrical stimulators in a network of wireless devices.",

We further investigated the temporal evolution and modulation on the social trait representation, and we employed encoding and decoding models to reveal the critical social traits for the trait space. We also recorded from another 259 neurons and replicated our findings using different social traits.

We found that CD4 T and B cells were independently enriched for MS genetics and further refined the driver subsets to Th17 and memory B cells, respectively. We replicated our findings in data from untreated and treated MS patients and found that immunomodulatory treatments suppress chromatin accessibility at driver cell types.

    "preprint_abstract": "Decoding cognitive processes from recordings of brain activity has been an active topic in neuroscience research for decades. Traditional decoding studies focused on pattern classification in specific regions of interest and averaging brain activity over many trials. Recently, brain decoding with graph neural networks has been shown to scale at fine temporal resolution and on the full brain, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the human connectome project benchmark. The reason behind this success is likely the strong inductive connectome prior that enables the integration of distributed patterns of brain activity. Yet, the nature of such inductive bias is still poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the impact of the inclusion of multiple path lengths (through high-order graph convolution), the homogeneity of brain parcels (graph nodes), and the type of interactions (graph edges). We evaluate the decoding models on a large population of 1200 participants, under 21 different experimental conditions, acquired from the Human Connectome Project database. Our findings reveal that the optimal choice for large-scale cognitive decoding is to propagate neural dynamics within empirical functional connectomes and integrate brain dynamics using high-order graph convolutions. In this setting, the model exhibits high decoding accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks on the graph architecture, including randomization in functional connectomes and lesions in targeted brain regions and networks. The trained model relies on biologically meaningful features for the prediction of cognitive states and generates task-specific graph representations resembling task-evoked activation maps. These results demonstrate that a full-brain integrative model is critical for the large-scale brain decoding. Our study establishes principles of how to effectively leverage human connectome constraints in deep graph neural networks, providing new avenues to study the neural substrates of human cognition at scale.",

However, because of its use of short-reads, it is severely limited at detecting full-length features of transcripts such as alternative splicing. New library preparation techniques attempt to extend single-cell sequencing by utilizing both long-and short-reads. These techniques split the library material, after it is tagged with cellular barcodes, into two pools: one for short-read sequencing and one for long-read sequencing. However, the challenge of utilizing these techniques is that they require matching the cellular barcodes sequenced by the erroneous long-reads to the cellular barcodes detected by the short-reads. To overcome this challenge, we introduce scTagger, a computational method to match cellular barcodes data from long-and short-reads. We tested scTagger against another state-of-the-art tool on both real and simulated datasets and we demonstrate that scTagger has both significantly better accuracy and time efficiency.",

Non-target effects of pesticides and fertilizers have put agricultural intensification in the focus as a driver for biodiversity loss. However, other pollutants, such as heavy metals, particulate matter, or microplastic also enter the environment, e.g. via traffic and industrial activities in urban areas. As soil acts as a potential sink for such pollutants, soil invertebrates like earthworms may be particularly affected by them. Under natural conditions soil invertebrates will likely be confronted with combinations of pollutants simultaneously, which may result in stronger negative effects if pollutants act synergistically.\n\nWithin this work we study how multiple pollutants affect the soil-dwelling, substrate feeding earthworm Eisenia fetida. We compared the effects of the single stressors, polystyrene microplastic fragments, polystyrene fibers, brake dust and soot, with the combined effect of these pollutants when applied as a mixture. Endpoints measured were survival, growth, reproductive fitness, and changes in three oxidative stress markers. We found that among single pollutant treatments, brake dust imposed the strongest negative effects on earthworms in all measured endpoints including increased mortality rates. Sub-lethal effects were found for all pollutants. Exposing earthworms to all four pollutants simultaneously led to effects on mortality and oxidative stress markers that were smaller than expected by the respective null models. These antagonistic effects are likely a result of the adsorption of toxic substances found in brake dust to the other pollutants. With this study we show that effects of combinations of pollutants cannot necessarily be predicted from their individual effects and that combined effects will likely depend on identity and concentration of the pollutants.",

Its symmetric structure and ring-like bacteriochlorophyll arrangement make it an ideal system for theoreticians and spectroscopists. LH2 complexes from most bacterial species are thought to have eightfold or ninefold symmetry, but recently a sevenfold symmetric LH2 structure from the bacterium Mch. purpuratum was solved by Cryo-Electron microscopy. This LH2 also possesses unique nearinfrared absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectral properties. Here we use an atomistic strategy to elucidate the spectral properties of Mch. purpuratum LH2 and understand the differences with the most commonly studied LH2 from Rbl. acidophilus. Our strategy exploits a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, multiscale polarizable quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, and lineshape simulations. Our calculations reveal that the spectral properties of LH2 complexes are tuned by site energies and exciton couplings, which in turn depend on the structural fluctuations of the bacteriochlorophylls. Our strategy proves effective in reproducing the absorption and CD spectra of the two LH2 complexes, and in uncovering the origin of their differences. This work proves that it is possible to obtain insight into the spectral tuning strategies of purple bacteria by quantitatively simulating the spectral properties of their antenna complexes.",

The model is consistent with the observed antibody concentrations required to induce immunity and with the observed dependence of vaccine efficacy on antibody concentration and thus is a useful tool in the development of models to relate, for an individual person, risk of infection given measured antibody concentration. It can be used to relate population breakthrough infection risk to the distribution across the population of antibody concentration, and its variation with time.",

This has been a key obstacle to the development of cannabinoid-based therapeutics. However, most of the published work has been performed with only three compounds, namely {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol, CP55,940 and WIN55,212-2. Hypothesizing that different compounds may lead to distinct outcomes, we herein used the highly potent CB1R/CB2R full agonist HU-210, and first aimed at replicating cannabinoid-induced long-lasting effects, by exposing adolescent female Sprague-Dawley rats to increasing doses of HU-210, for 11 days and testing them at adulthood, after a 30-day drug washout. Surprisingly, HU-210 did not significantly impact adult anxious- or depressive-like behaviors. We then tested whether chronic adolescent HU-210 treatment resulted in short-term (24h) alterations in depressive-like behavior. Remarkably, HU-210 treatment simultaneously induced marked antidepressant- and prodepressant-like responses, in the modified forced swim (mFST) and sucrose preference tests (SPT), respectively. Hypothesizing that mFST results were a misleading artifact of HU-210-induced behavioral hyperreactivity to stress, we assessed plasmatic noradrenaline and corticosterone levels, under basal conditions and following an acute swim-stress episode. Notably, we found that while HU-210 did not alter basal noradrenaline or corticosterone levels, it greatly augmented the stress-induced increase in both.\n\nOur results show that, contrary to previously studied cannabinoid receptor agonists, HU-210 does not induce persisting depressive-like alterations, despite inducing marked short-term increases in stress-induced reactivity. By showing that not all cannabinoid receptor agonists may induce long-term negative effects, these results hold significant relevance for the development of cannabinoid-based therapeutics.",

In the brain, the probes allowed robust electrical measurement and optogenetic stimulation. Scalable fabrication strategies can be used with various electrical and optical materials, making the probes highly customizable to experimental requirements, including length, diameter, and mechanical properties.

    "preprint_abstract": "PiRNAs prevent transposable elements wreaking havoc on the germline genome. Changes in piRNA expression over the lifetime of an individual may impact on ageing through continued suppression, or release, of transposable element expression. We identified piRNA producing clusters in the genome of Daphnia magna by a combination of bioinformatic methods, and then contrasted their expression between parthenogenetically produced eggs representing maternally-deposited germline piRNAs of young (having their 1st clutch) and old (having their 5th clutch) mothers. Results from eggs were compared to cluster expression in three generations of adults. As for other arthropods, D. magna encodes long uni-directionally transcribed non-coding RNAs which consist of transposable element fragments which account for most piRNAs expressed. Egg tissues showed extensive differences between clutches from young mothers and those from old mothers, with 578 and 686 piRNA clusters upregulated, respectively, although most log fold-change differences for significant clusters were modest. When considering only highly expressed clusters, there was a bias towards 1st clutch eggs at 41 upregulated versus eight clusters in the eggs from older mothers. F0 generation differences between young and old mothers were fewer than eggs, as 179 clusters were up-regulated in young versus 170 old mothers. This dropped to 31 versus 22 piRNA clusters when comparing adults in the F1 generation, and no differences were detected in the F3 generation. These patterns were similar to that observed for D. magna micro-RNA expression. Little overlap in differentially expressed clusters was found between adults containing mixed somatic and germline (ovary) tissues and germ-line representing eggs. A cluster encompassing a Tudor domain containing gene important in the piRNA pathway was upregulated in the eggs from old mothers. We hypothesise that regulation of this gene this could form part of a feedback loop that reduces piRNA pathway activity explaining the reduced number of highly-expressed clusters in eggs from old mothers.\n\nAuthor SummarySmall RNAs shorter than 200 nucleotides often function by targeting RNAs with complementary nucleotide sequences for destruction. A subset of small RNAs, the Piwi-interacting RNAs or piRNAs are best known for silencing sequences of DNA that can jump between locations in the genome which can compromise the integrity of genomes. This protects offspring from sterility and other undesirable effects, hence piRNAs have been termed  guardians of the genome. PiRNAs have several characteristics, such as a characteristic length and origin in genomic graveyards of junk DNA, that can be used to distinguish them from other small RNAs. Here, we used a combination of computational approaches to identify piRNA-producing clusters in the genome of the water flea Daphnia magna. We then contrasted expression of these clusters between genetically identical adults of different ages, their eggs, adult offspring and great-granddaughters. Adults and their eggs were markedly different in cluster expression by age, which was mostly lost by adulthood in offspring and not seen at all in great-granddaughters. By taking an innovative approach that can be applied to similar datasets of diverse organisms we have shown that piRNA expression, and therefore, stability of the genome can change with age.",

    "preprint_abstract": "BackgroundLong sequencing reads allow increasing contiguity and completeness of fragmented, short-read based genome assemblies by closing assembly gaps, ideally at high accuracy. While several gap closing methods have been developed, these methods often close an assembly gap with sequence that does not accurately represent the true sequence.\n\nFindingsHere, we present DENTIST, a sensitive, highly accurate and automated pipeline method to close gaps in short-read assemblies with long error-prone reads. DENTIST comprehensively determines repetitive assembly regions to identify reliable and unambiguous alignments of long reads to the correct loci, integrates a consensus sequence computation step to obtain a high base accuracy for the inserted sequence, and validates the accuracy of closed gaps. Unlike previous benchmarks, we generated test assemblies that have gaps at the exact positions where real short-read assemblies have gaps. Generating such realistic benchmarks for Drosophila (134 Mb genome), Arabidopsis (119 Mb), hummingbird (1 Gb) and human (3 Gb) and using simulated or real PacBio continuous long reads, we show that DENTIST consistently achieves a substantially higher accuracy compared to previous methods, while having a similar sensitivity.\n\nConclusionDENTIST provides an accurate approach to improve the contiguity and completeness of fragmented assemblies with long reads. DENTISTs source code including a Snakemake workflow, conda package and Docker container is available at https://github.com/a-ludi/dentist. All test assemblies as a resource for future benchmarking are at https://bds.mpi-cbg.de/hillerlab/DENTIST/.",

The hippocampus has been suggested to play a pivotal role in both learning environmental statistics, as well as exploiting them to generate perceptual predictions. However, it is unclear how the hippocampus balances encoding new predictive associations with the retrieval of existing ones. Here, we present the results of two high resolution human fMRI studies (N=24 for both experiments) directly investigating this. Participants were exposed to auditory cues that predicted the identity of an upcoming visual shape (with 75% validity). Using multivoxel decoding analysis, we found that the hippocampus initially preferentially represented unexpected shapes (i.e., those that violated the cue regularities), but later switched to representing the cue-predicted shape regardless of which was actually presented. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus in involved both acquiring and exploiting predictive associations, and switches between these modes depending on whether learning is ongoing or complete.",

FlhG is a paralog of the Escherichia coli cell division regulator MinD, which has a longer N-terminal region. Deleting the N-terminal region of FlhG results in cells with multiple flagella. The Q9A mutation in the DQAxxLR motif of the N-terminal region prevents it from activating the GTPase activity of FlhF in vitro and results in a multi-flagellation phenotype. The mutant FlhG protein was remarkably reduced compared to that of the wild-type protein in vivo. When the mutant FlhG was expressed at the same level as the wild-type FlhG, the number of flagella was restored to the wild-type level. Once synthesized in Vibrio cells, the N-terminal region mutation in FlhG seems not to affect the protein stability. We speculated that the flhG translation efficiency is decreased by N-terminal mutation. Our results suggest that the N-terminal region of FlhG controls the number of flagella by adjusting the FlhF activity and the amount of FlhG in vivo. We speculate that the regulation by FlhG, achieved through transcription by the master regulator FlaK, is affected by the mutations, resulting in reduced flagellar formation by FlhF.",

Whether and how these two aspects interact to shape computations is currently unclear. Using a novel approach to extract computational mechanisms from networks trained on neuroscience tasks, here we show that the dimensionality of the dynamics and cell-class structure play fundamentally complementary roles. While various tasks can be implemented by increasing the dimensionality in networks with fully random population structure, flexible input-output mappings instead required a non-random population structure that can be described in terms of multiple sub-populations. Our analyses revealed that such a population structure enabled flexible computations through a mechanism based on gain-controlled modulations that flexibly shape the dynamical landscape of collective dynamics. Our results lead to task-specific predictions for the structure of neural selectivity, inactivation experiments, and for the implication of different neurons in multi-tasking.",

Development of broadly effective coronavirus vaccines that can mitigate these threats is needed 8, 9. Notably, several recent studies have revealed that vaccination of recovered COVID-19 donors results in enhanced nAb responses compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination alone 10-13. Here, we utilized a targeted donor selection strategy to isolate a large panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to sarbecoviruses from two such donors. Many of the bnAbs are remarkably effective in neutralization against sarbecoviruses that use ACE2 for viral entry and a substantial fraction also show notable binding to non-ACE2-using sarbecoviruses. The bnAbs are equally effective against most SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and many neutralize the Omicron variant. Neutralization breadth is achieved by bnAb binding to epitopes on a relatively conserved face of the receptor binding domain (RBD) as opposed to strain-specific nAbs to the receptor binding site that are commonly elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination 14-18. Consistent with targeting of conserved sites, select RBD bnAbs exhibited in vivo protective efficacy against diverse SARS-like coronaviruses in a prophylaxis challenge model. The generation of a large panel of potent bnAbs provides new opportunities and choices for next-generation antibody prophylactic and therapeutic applications and, importantly, provides a molecular basis for effective design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.",

Our findings provide insights into structural modification caused by the mutations in the Omicrons receptor-binding domain and look into the effects on interaction with the hosts neutralising antibodies CR3022, B38, CB6, P2B-2F6, and REGN, as well as ACE2R using an in silico approach. We have employed secondary structure prediction, structural superimposition, protein disorderness, molecular docking, and MD simulation to investigate host-pathogen interactions, immune evasion, and transmissibility caused by mutations in the RBD region of the spike protein of the Omicron variant and compared it to the Delta variants (AY.1, AY.2, & AY.3) and wild type. Computational analysis revealed that the Omicron variant has a higher binding affinity for the human ACE2 receptor than the wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2 strains), but lower than the Delta AY.3 strain. MD simulation and docking analysis suggest that the omicron and Delta AY.3 were found to have relatively unstable and compact RBD structures and hampered interactions with antibodies more than wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2), which may lead to relatively more pathogenicity and antibody escape. In addition, we observed lower binding affinity of Omicron for human monoclonal antibodies (CR3022, B38, CB6, and P2B2F6) when compared to wild and Delta (AY.1 & AY.2). However, the binding affinity of Omicron RBD variants for CR3022, B38, and P2B2F6 antibodies is lower as compared to Delta AY.3, which might promote immune evasion and reinfection and needs further experimental investigation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Plant-pathogenic fungi span diverse taxonomic lineages. Their host-infection strategies are often specialised and require the coordinated regulation of molecular virulence factors. Transcription factors (TFs) are fundamental regulators of gene expression, controlling development and virulence in plant pathogenic fungi. Recent research has established regulatory roles for several taxonomically conserved fungal TFs, but the evolution of specific virulence regulators is not well understood. This study sought to explore the representation of TFs across a taxonomically-diverse range of fungi, with a focus on plant pathogens. A significant trend was observed among the obligate, host-associated pathogens, which possess a reduced overall TF repertoire, alluding to a lack of pressure for maintaining diversity. A novel orthology-based analysis is then presented that refined TF classifications, traditionally based on the nature of the DNA-binding domains. Using this analysis, cases of TF over/underrepresentation across fungal pathogen lineages are systematically highlighted. Specific examples are then explored and discussed that included the TF orthologues of Ste12, Pf2 and EBR1, plus phytotoxic secondary-metabolite cluster regulators, which all presented novel and distinct evolutionary insights. Ultimately, as the examples presented demonstrate, this resource can be interrogated to guide functional studies that seek to characterise virulence-specific regulators and shed light on the factors underpinning plant pathogenicity.",

As differences in spike (S) proteins may underlie differences in their pathobiology, here we determine cryo-EM structures of a BA.2 S ectodomain and compare these to previously determined BA.1 S structures. BA.2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) mutations induced remodeling of the internal RBD structure resulting in its improved thermostability and tighter packing within the 3-RBD-down spike. In the S2 subunit, the fusion peptide in BA.2 was less accessible to antibodies than in BA.1. Pseudovirus neutralization and spike binding assays revealed extensive immune evasion while defining epitopes of two RBD-directed antibodies, DH1044 and DH1193, that bound the outer RBD face to neutralize both BA.1 and BA.2. Taken together, our results indicate that stabilization of the 3-RBD-down state through interprotomer RBD-RBD packing is a hallmark of the Omicron variant, and reveal differences in key functional regions in the BA.1 and BA.2 S proteins.",

Here, we describe a previously unknown mechanism by which mono- and diderm bacteria survive infection with diverse lytic phages. Phage exposure leads to a rapid and near complete conversion of walled cells to a cell wall-deficient state, which remain viable in osmoprotective conditions and can revert to the walled state. While shedding the cell wall dramatically reduces the number of progeny phages produced by the host, it does not always preclude phage infection. Altogether, these results show that the formation of cell wall-deficient cells prevents complete eradication of the bacterial population and suggest that cell wall-deficiency may limit the efficacy of phage therapy, especially in highly osmotic environments or when used together with antibiotics that target the cell wall.",

Dispersal behavior may be shaped by many factors, such as mate-finding, the spatial distribution of resources, or wind and currents, yet most models of spatial dynamics assume random dispersal. We examined the spatial dynamics of a day-flying moth species (Arctia virginalis) that forms mating aggregations on hilltops ( hilltopping) based on long-term adult and larval population censuses. Using time-series models, we compared spatial population dynamics resulting from empirically-founded hilltop-based connectivity indices, and modeled the interactive effects of temperature, precipitation, and density dependence. Model comparisons supported hilltop-based connectivity metrics over random connectivity, suggesting an effect of hilltopping behavior on dynamics. We also found strong interactive effects of temperature and precipitation on dynamics. Simulations based on fitted time series models showed lower patch occupancy and regional synchrony, and higher colonization and extinction rates when hilltopping was included, with potential implications for the probability of persistence of the patch network. Overall, our results show the potential for dispersal behavior to have important effects on spatial population dynamics and persistence, and we advocate inclusion of such non-random dispersal in metapopulation models.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) serve two fundamental functions in insects: protection against desiccation and chemical signaling. CHC profiles can consist of dozens of different compounds and are considered a prime example for a complex trait. How the interaction of genes shapes CHC profiles, which are essential for insect survival, adaptation, and reproductive success, is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the genetic and genomic basis of CHC biosynthesis and variation in parasitoid wasps of the genus Nasonia. Taking advantage of the wasps haplo-diploid sex determination and cross-species fertility, we mapped 91 quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining variation of a total of 43 CHCs in F2 hybrid males from interspecific crosses between three Nasonia species. To identify candidate genes, we localized orthologs of CHC biosynthesis-related genes in the Nasonia genomes. By doing so, we discovered multiple genomic regions where the location of QTL coincides with the location of CHC biosynthesis-related candidate genes. Most conspicuously, on a region on chromosome 1 close to the centromere, multiple CHC biosynthesis-related candidate genes co-localize with several QTL explaining variation in methyl-branched alkanes. The genetic underpinnings behind this compound class are not well understood so far, despite their high potential for encoding chemical information as well as their prevalence in both Nasonia CHC profiles and many other Hymenoptera. Our study considerably extends our knowledge on the so far little-known genetic and genomic architecture governing biosynthesis and variation of this fundamental compound class, establishing a model for methyl-branched alkane genetics in the Hymenoptera in general.",

Differential gene expression and alternative splicing are two elements of the transcriptomic stress response that may work in tandem, but relatively few studies have investigated these interactions in fishes of conservation concern. We studied the imperilled redside dace (Clinostomus elongatus) as thermal stress is hypothesised to be an important cause of population declines. We tested the hypothesis that gene expression-splicing interactions contribute to the thermal stress response. Wild fish exposed to acute thermal stress were compared with both handling controls and fish sampled directly from a river. Liver tissue was sampled to study the transcriptomic stress response. Thermally stressed fish showed a prominent transcriptional response (estimated with mRNA transcript abundance) related to transcription regulation and responses to unfolded proteins, and prominent alternatively spliced genes related to gene expression regulation and metabolism. One splicing factor, prpf38b, was upregulated in the thermally stressed group compared to the other treatments. This splicing factor may have a role in the Jun/AP-1 cellular stress response, a pathway with wide-ranging and context-dependent effects. Given large gene interaction networks and the context-dependent nature of transcriptional responses, our results highlight the importance of understanding interactions between gene expression and splicing for understanding transcriptomic responses to thermal stress. Our results also reveal transcriptional pathways that can inform conservation breeding, translocation, and reintroduction programs for redside dace and other imperilled species by identifying appropriate source populations.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTGene expression and alternative splicing interact in response to thermal stress in an imperilled fish, with implications for conservation and mechanisms of thermal tolerance in vertebrate ectotherms.",

However, combining the techniques that provide both streams of data represents an experimental challenge. When studying glomerular column circuits in the mouse olfactory bulb, this approach involves e.g. recording the neuronal activity with in vivo 2-photon (2P) calcium imaging, retrieving the circuit structure with synchrotron X-ray computed tomography with propagation-based phase contrast (SXRT) and/or serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) and correlating these datasets. Sample preparation and dataset correlation are two key bottlenecks in this correlative workflow. Here, we first quantify the occurrence of different artefacts when staining tissue slices with heavy metals to generate X-ray or electron contrast. We report improvements in the staining procedure, ultimately achieving perfect staining in [~]67% of the 0.6 mm thick olfactory bulb slices that were previously imaged in vivo with 2P. Secondly, we characterise the accuracy of the spatial correlation between functional and structural datasets. We demonstrate that direct, single-cell precise correlation between in vivo 2P and SXRT tissue volumes is possible and as reliable as correlating between 2P and SBEM. Altogether, these results pave the way for experiments that require retrieving physiology, circuit structure and synaptic signatures in targeted regions.

Here, we posit a comprehensive framework based on bipartite graphs for interbrain networks and address whether they provide meaningful insights into the neural underpinnings of social interactions. First, we show that the nodal density of such graphs exhibits nonrandom properties. While the current analyses mostly rely on global metrics, we encode the regions roles via matrix decomposition to obtain an interpretable network representation yielding both global and local insights. With Bayesian modeling, we reveal how synchrony patterns seeded in specific brain regions contribute to global effects. Beyond inferential inquiries, we demonstrate that graph representations can be used to predict individual social characteristics, outperforming functional connectivity estimators for this purpose.

    "preprint_abstract": "Multi-armed restless bandit tasks are regularly applied in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to assess exploration and exploitation behavior in structured environments. These models are also readily applied to examine effects of (virtual) brain lesions on performance, and to infer neurocomputational mechanisms using neuroimaging or pharmacological approaches. However, to infer individual, psychologically meaningful parameters from such data, computational cognitive modeling is typically applied. Recent studies indicate that softmax (SM) decision rule models that include a representation of environmental dynamics (e.g. the Kalman Filter) and additional parameters for modeling exploration and perseveration (Kalman SMEP) fit human bandit task data better than competing models. Parameter and model recovery are two central requirements for computational models: parameter recovery refers to the ability to recover true data-generating parameters; model recovery refers to the ability to correctly identify the true data generating model using model comparison techniques. Here we comprehensively examined parameter and model recovery of the Kalman SMEP model as well as nested model versions, i.e. models without the additional parameters, using simulation and Bayesian inference. Parameter recovery improved with increasing trial numbers, from around .8 for 100 trials to around .93 for 300 trials. Model recovery analyses likewise confirmed acceptable recovery of the Kalman SMEP model. Model recovery was lower for nested Kalman filter models as well as delta rule models with fixed learning rates.\n\nExploratory analyses examined associations of model parameters with model-free performance metrics. Random exploration, captured by the inverse softmax temperature, was associated with lower accuracy and more switches. For the exploration bonus parameter modeling directed exploration, we confirmed an inverse-U-shaped association with accuracy, such that both an excess and a lack of directed exploration reduced accuracy. Taken together, these analyses underline that the Kalman SMEP model fulfills basic requirements of a cognitive model.",

Chemicals are routinely used to control major pathogens, including the causal agents of grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) and lettuce drop (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum). With increasing prevalence of pathogen resistance to fungicides and environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to identify sources of genetic resistance to B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum in lettuce. We demonstrated genetic variation for quantitative resistance to B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum in a set of 97 diverse lettuce and wild relative accessions, and between the parents of lettuce mapping populations. Transcriptome profiling across multiple lettuce accessions enabled us to identify genes with expression correlated with resistance, predicting the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in the lettuce defence response. We identified five genetic loci influencing quantitative resistance in a F10 mapping population derived from a Lactuca serriola (wild relative) x lettuce cross, which each explained 5-10% of the variation. Differential gene expression analysis between the parent lines, and integration of data on correlation of gene expression and resistance in the diversity set, highlighted potential causal genes underlying the quantitative trait loci.\n\nKey MessageWe demonstrate genetic variation for quantitative resistance against important fungal pathogens in lettuce and its wild relatives, map loci conferring resistance and predict key molecular mechanisms using transcriptome profiling.",

They are ubiquitously distributed across different microhabitats in all terrestrial ecosystems around the world and were among the first animals colonizing terrestrial habitats as decomposers and scavengers. Despite their species richness and ecological importance genomic resources are lacking for oribatids. Here, we present a 190-Mb genome assembly of the clonal, all-female oribatid mite species Archegozetes longisetosus Aoki, a model species used by numerous laboratories for the past 30 years. Comparative genomic and transcriptional analyses revealed patterns of reduced body segmentation and loss of segmental identity gene abd-A within Acariformes, and unexpected expression of key eye development genes in these eyeless mites across developmental stages. Consistent with their soil dwelling lifestyle, investigation of the sensory genes revealed a species-specific expansion of gustatory receptors, the largest chemoreceptor family in the genome used in olfaction, and evidence of horizontally transferred enzymes used in cell wall degradation of plant and fungal matter, both components of the A. longisetosus diet. Oribatid mites are also noted for their biosynthesis capacities and biochemical diversity. Using biochemical and genomic data, we were able to delineate the backbone biosynthesis of monoterpenes, an important class of compounds found in the major exocrine gland system of Oribatida - the oil glands. Given the mites strength as an experimental model, the new high-quality resources provided here will serve as the foundation for molecular research in Oribatida and will enable a broader understanding of chelicerate evolution.",

In the present study we investigated molecular motions of four types of model membranes to shed light on the variations of dynamics and structure as a function of temperature as protocells might have existed close to hot vents.

However, as a result of a bias in the availability of data-types that are collected, the vast majority of gene regulatory network resources and tools have focused on either transcriptional regulation or protein-protein interactions. This has left other areas of regulation, for instance translational regulation, vastly underrepresented despite them having been shown to play a critical role in both health and disease.\n\nResultsIn order to address this we have developed CLIPreg, a package that integrates RNA, Ribo and CLIP-sequencing data in order to construct translational regulatory networks coordinated by RNA-binding proteins. This is the first tool of its type to be created, allowing for detailed investigation into a previously unseen layer of regulation.\n\nAvailability and implementationCLIPreg is available at https://github.com/SGDDNB/CLIPreg.\n\nContactowen.rackham@duke-nus.edu.sg or sonia.chothani@u.duke.nus.edu",

Actin filament nucleation and elongation activities reside in the formin homology 1 (FH1) and FH2 domains, common to all formins. However, the rate of these reactions varies between formins by at least 20-fold. Typically, each cell expresses several distinct formins, each contributing to the assembly of one or several actin structures, raising the question of what confers each formin its specificity. Here, using the formin Fus1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we systematically probed the importance of formin nucleation and elongation rates for function in vivo. Fus1 assembles the actin fusion focus, an aster-like structure of actin filaments at the contact site between gametes, necessary for the process of cell fusion to form the zygote during sexual reproduction. By constructing chimeric formins with combinations of FH1 and FH2 domains previously characterized in vitro, we establish that changes in formin nucleation and elongation rates have direct consequences on the architecture of the fusion focus, and that Fus1 native high nucleation and low elongation rates are optimal for fusion focus assembly. We further describe a point mutant in the Fus1 FH2 domain that preserves native nucleation and elongation rates in vitro but alters function in vivo, indicating an additional property of the FH2 domain. Thus, rates of actin assembly are tailored for assembly of specific actin structures.",

How migration and differentiation are coordinated and impact each other to form functional structures is not fully understood. Neural crest cells migrate extensively giving rise to many cell types. In the trunk, neural crest migrate collectively forming chains comprised of cells with distinct migratory identities: one leader cell at the front of the group directs migration, while followers track the leader forming the body of the chain. Herein we analysed the relationship between trunk neural crest migratory identity and terminal differentiation. We found that trunk neural crest migration and fate allocation is coherent. Leader cells that initiate movement give rise to the most distal derivativities. Interestingly, the asymmetric division of leaders separates migratory identity and fate. The distal daughter cell retains the leader identity and clonally forms the Sympathetic Ganglia. The proximal sibling migrates as a follower and gives rise to Schwann cells. The sympathetic neuron transcription factor phox2bb is strongly expressed by leaders from early stages of migration, suggesting that specification and migration occur concomitantly and in coordination. Followers divide symmetrically and their fate correlates with their position in the chain.",

In the present study, we reconstructed intrahepatic bile ducts in a rat decellularized liver graft by recellularization with liver ductal organoids. Using an ex vivo perfusion culture system, we demonstrated the biliary characteristics of repopulated mouse liver organoids, which maintained bile duct markers and reconstructed biliary tree-like networks with luminal structures. We also established a method for the co-recellularization with engineered bile ducts and primary hepatocytes, revealing the appropriate cell distribution to mimic the native liver. We then utilized this model in human organoids to demonstrate the reconstructed bile ducts.

    "preprint_abstract": "An important goal for conservation is to define minimum viable population (MVP) sizes for long-term persistence. Although many MVP size estimates focus on ecological processes, with increasing evidence for the role of genetic problems in population extinction, conservation practitioners have also increasingly started to incorporate inbreeding depression (ID). However, small populations also face other genetic problems such as mutation accumulation (MA) and loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift that are usually factored into population viability assessments only via verbal arguments. Comprehensive quantitative theory on interacting genetic problems is missing. Here we develop eco-evolutionary quantitative models that track both population size and levels of genetic diversity. Our models assume a biallelic multilocus genome whose loci can be under either a single or interacting genetic forces. In addition to mutation-selection-drift balance (for loci facing ID and MA), we include three forms of balancing selection (for loci where variation is lost through genetic drift). We define MVP size as the lowest population size that avoids an eco-evolutionary extinction vortex after a time sufficient for an equilibrium allele frequency distribution to establish. Our results show that MVP size decreases rapidly with increasing mutation rates for populations whose genomes are only under balancing selection, while for genomes under mutation-selection-drift balance, the MVP size increases rapidly. MVP sizes also increase rapidly with increasing number of loci under the same or different selection mechanisms until a point is reached at which even arbitrarily large populations cannot survive anymore. In the case of fixed number of loci under selection, interaction of genetic problems did not necessarily increase MVP sizes. To further enhance our understanding about interaction of genetic problems, there is need for more empirical studies to reveal how different genetic processes interact in the genome.",

Prior studies in our group have identified a temporal coupling of Autonomic and Central Events (ACEs) during sleep using electrocardiogram to measure heart rate and electroencephalography to measure brain rhythms, with heart rate bursts (HRBs) temporally coincided with increased slow-wave-activity (SWA, 0.5-1Hz) and sigma activity (12-15Hz), followed by parasympathetic surge (RRHF) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. ACEs predicted working memory (WM) improvement in young adults. Given that there are paralleling age-related declines in both the ANS and CNS, the current study investigated differences in ACE activity during daytime sleep in older and younger adults and their functional impact on working memory. Compared to youngers, older adults showed lower amplitude of ACEs during NREM sleep, but no age-related difference during Wake. Furthermore, while younger adults demonstrated a parasympathetic surge after HRBs, older adults showed a different pattern, with a earlier rise and maintenance of the RRHF. Finally, we examined whether ACE predicted WM in older adults. We found that older adults with good WM show stronger coupling, whereas low WM performers had less robust ACE activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that autonomic-central coupling declines with age, with possible links to deterioration in WM function. Given that age-related deterioration in autonomic and central nervous system activity is implicated in pathological decline, the current findings may facilitate novel insights to the cognitive neuroscience of aging.",

Here, using isolated and demembranated flagella from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii), we build efficient axonemally-driven micro-swimmers that consume ATP to propel micron-sized beads. Depending on the calcium concentration, we observed two main classes of motion: Whereas beads move along curved trajectories at calcium concentrations below 0.03 mM, they are propelled along straight paths when the calcium concentration increases. In this regime, they reached velocities of approximately 20 m/sec, comparable to human sperm velocity in vivo. We relate this transition to the properties of beating axonemes, in particular the reduced static curvature with increasing calcium concentration. To quantify the motion, we used mode decomposition of the flagellar waveform, and we studied both analytically and numerically the propulsion of the bead as a function of the axonemal waveform and bead-axoneme attachment geometry. While our analysis semi-quantitatively describes the experimental results, it also reveals the existence of a counter-intuitive propulsion regime where the speed of the axonemally-driven bead increases with the size of the bead. Moreover, we demonstrated that asymmetric, sideways attachment of the axoneme to the bead can also contribute to the rotational velocity of the micro-swimmer. The uncovered mechanism has potential applications in the fabrication of synthetic micro-swimmers, and in particular, bio-actuated medical micro-robots for targeted drug delivery.",

We found allelic imbalances in the expression of PIK3CA in normal breast tissue and mapped a germline candidate regulatory variant. An imbalance was also frequently observed in the expression of the missense mutant and wild-type PIK3CA alleles in breast tumors from METABRIC and TCGA projects. Moreover, although 60% of tumors preferentially expressed the mutant allele, 10% did preferentially express the wild-type allele. Mechanistically, we show that these imbalances are more frequently due to regulatory variants in cis than altered copy-number and predict that somatic variants have a more significant role than germline ones. We further found that imbalanced allelic expression between mutant and wild-type alleles due to cis-regulatory variants associated with poor prognosis (p=0.0081).\n\nInterestingly, ER+, PR+, and Her2- tumors expressing very low levels of the mutant allele had the poorest prognosis (DSS <7.5yrs for ER+ and PR+ tumors and <5yrs for Her2- tumors). Hence, our work provides compelling evidence to support the clinical utility of PIK3CA allelic expression in breast cancer in identifying this cohort of low mutant allele expressing patients of poorer prognosis, who will unlikely benefit from PI3K inhibitors.

An example is nitrite oxidation in partial nitritation-anammox (PNA) reactors during wastewater treatment, where suppression of nitrite oxidizers like Nitrospira is sought. In these ecosystems, biofilms provide microhabitats with oxygen gradients, allowing the coexistence aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. We designed a disturbance experiment where PNA biofilms treating water from a high rate activated sludge process removing organic matter (mainstream wastewater), were constantly or intermittently exposed to the effluent of anaerobic sewage sludge digestion dewatering (sidestream wastewater), which has been proposed to inhibit nitrite oxidizers. With increasing sidestream exposure we observed decreased abundance, alpha-diversity, functional versatility, and hence functional redundancy, among Nitrospira in the PNA biofilms, while the opposite patterns were observed for anammox bacteria within Brocadia. At the same time, species turnover was observed for the aerobic ammonia-oxidizing Nitrosomonas populations. The different exposure regimens were associated with metagenomic assembled genomes of Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, and Brocadia, encoding genes related to N-cycling, substrate usage, and osmotic stress response, possibly explaining the three different patterns by niche differentiation. These findings imply that disturbances can be used to manage the functional redundancy of biofilm microbiomes in a desirable direction, which should be considered when designing operational strategies for wastewater treatment.",

We have previously shown that intrinsic kinase activity of LRRK2 isolated from PBMCs of G2019S carriers is elevated, irrespective of disease status. In the present study we find that phosphorylation of Rab10 is also elevated in G2019S carriers, but only those with PD. Additionally, phosphorylation of this substrate is also elevated in 2 separate idiopathic PD cohorts, but not in carriers of the A53T mutation in -synuclein. In contrast, Rab29 phosphorylation was specifically reduced in urinary exosomes from A53T and idiopathic PD patients. Taken together, our findings highlight the need for the assessment of multiple complimentary targets for a more comprehensive picture of the disease.",

Despite the growing knowledge on the anatomy and diversity of placoderms over the past decade, the dermal scales of placoderms are predominantly known from isolated material, either morphologically or histologically, resulting in their squamation being poorly understood. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the squamation and scale morphology of a primitive taxon of Antiarcha (a clade at the root of jawed vertebrates), Parayunnanolepis xitunensis, based on the virtual restoration of an articulated specimen by using X-ray computed tomography. Thirteen morphotypes of scales are classified to exhibit how the morphology changes with their position on the body in primitive antiarchs, based on which nine areas of the post-thoracic body are distinguished to show their scale variations in the dorsal, flank, ventral, and caudal lobe regions. In this study, the histological structure of yunnanolepidoid scales was described for the first time based on disarticulated scales from the type locality and horizon of P. xitunensis, demonstrating that yunnanolepidoid scales are remarkably different from the dermal plates of antiarchs including yunnanolepidoids in the absence of developed middle layer. Together, our study reveals that the high regionalization of squamation and the bipartite histological structure of scale might be plesiomorphic for antiarchs, and jawed vertebrates in general.",

However, the long lifespan and limited amenability to genetic and pharmacological perturbations have hindered the use of mammals for dissecting aging-regulatory molecular networks and discovering new anti-aging interventions. To circumvent these limitations, we developed an ex vivo model system that faithfully mimics the aging process of the mammalian brain using cultured mouse brain slices. Genome-wide gene expression analyses showed that brain slices spontaneously upregulated senescence-associated genes over time and reproduced many of the transcriptional characteristics of aged brains. Treatment with rapamycin, a classical anti-aging compound, largely abolished the time-dependent transcriptional changes in brain slices. Using this model system, we discovered that prions drastically accelerated the development of age-related molecular signatures and the pace of brain aging. We confirmed this finding in mouse models and human victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These data establish a novel, eminently tractable mammalian model of brain aging, and uncover a surprising acceleration of brain aging in prion diseases.",

For many G protein-coupled receptors, the development of high-affinity fluorescence ligands has expanded the options for high throughput screening of drug candidates and serve as useful tools in fundamental receptor research. So far, the lack of suitable fluorescence ligands has limited studying M4 receptor ligand binding. Here, we explored the possibilities of using fluorescence-based methods for studying binding affinity and kinetics to M4 receptor of both labeled and unlabeled ligands. We used two TAMRA-labeled fluorescence ligands, UR-MK342 and UR-CG072, for assay development. Using budded baculovirus particles as M4 receptor preparation and fluorescence anisotropy method, we determined the affinities and binding kinetics of both fluorescence ligands. The fluorescence ligands could also be used as reported probes for determining binding affinities of a set of unlabeled ligands. Based on these results, we took a step further towards a more natural signaling system and developed a method using live CHO-K1-hM4R cells and automated fluorescence microscopy suitable for routine determination of unlabeled ligand affinities. For quantitative image analysis, we developed random forest and deep learning-based pipelines for cell segmentation. The pipelines were integrated into the user-friendly open-source Aparecium software. Both developed methods were suitable for measuring fluorescence ligand saturation binding, association and dissociation kinetics as well as for screening binding affinities of unlabeled ligands.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473643v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17dfac6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db1760org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dba2a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@191f149_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification have been reported. Moreover, the biological role of histidine methylation has remained poorly understood. Here, we report that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for the ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traverse on tyrosine codons, allowing the proper folding of synthesized proteins. By performing an in vitro methylation assay with a methyl donor analog and quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at the {tau}-N position by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed stoichiometric modification and suggested a role in translation tuning. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling revealed suppressed ribosomal translocation at tyrosine codons by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from the cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of a \"ribosome code\" that ensures proteome integrity in cells.",

However, many existing methods do not fully leverage the information that is shared among cell lines and drugs with similar structure. As such, drug similarities in terms of cell line responses and chemical structures could prove to be useful in forming drug representations to improve drug response prediction accuracy.\n\nResultsWe present two deep learning approaches, BiG-DRP and BiG-DRP+, for drug response prediction. Our models take advantage of the drugs chemical structure and the underlying relationships of drugs and cell lines through a bipartite graph and a heterogenous graph convolutional network that incorporate sensitive and resistant cell line information in forming drug representations. Evaluation of our methods and other state-of-the-art models in different scenarios shows that incorporating this bipartite graph significantly improves the prediction performance. Additionally, genes that contribute significantly to the performance of our models also point to important biological processes and signaling pathways. Analysis of predicted drug response of patients tumors using our model revealed important associations between mutations and drug sensitivity, illustrating the utility of our model in pharmacogenomics studies.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationAn implementation of the algorithms in Python is provided in github.com/ddhostallero/BiG-DRP.\n\nContactamin.emad@mcgill.ca\n\nSupplementary InformationOnline-only supplementary data is available at the journals website.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Nearly all mitochondrial proteins need to be targeted for import from the cytosol. For the majority, the first port of call is the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex), followed by a procession of alternative molecular machines, conducting transport to their final destination. The pre-sequence translocase of the inner-membrane (TIM23-complex) imports proteins with cleavable pre-sequences, and comes in two flavours: the TIM23SORT complex mediates inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein insertion and the TIM23MOTOR complex delivers proteins to the matrix. Progress in understanding these transport mechanisms has been hampered by the poor sensitivity and time-resolution of import assays. However, with the development of an assay based on split NanoLuc luciferase, we can now explore this process in greater detail. Here, we apply this new methodology to understand how {Delta}{psi} and ATP hydrolysis, the two main driving forces for import through the TIM23MOTOR complex, contribute to the import of pre-sequence-containing precursors (PCPs) with varying properties. Notably, we found that two major rate-limiting steps define PCP import time: passage of PCP across the OMM and initiation of IMM transport by the pre-sequence. The rates of these steps are influenced by PCP properties such as size and net charge, but not total amount of PCP imported - emphasising the importance of collecting rapid kinetic data, achieved here, to elucidate mechanistic detail. The apparent distinction between transport through the two membranes (passage through TOM is substantially complete before PCP-TIM engagement) is in contrast with the current view that import occurs through TOM and TIM in a single continuous step. Our results also indicate that PCPs spend very little time in the TIM23 channel - presumably rapid success or failure of import is critical for maintaining mitochondrial fitness.",

To investigate the mechanisms behind network remodeling, we created a stochastic model with polymerization, depolymerization, branching, capping, uncapping, severing, oligomer diffusion, annealing, and debranching. We find that filament severing, enhanced near barbed ends, can explain the single molecule actin lifetime distribution, if oligomer fragments reanneal to free ends with rate constants comparable to in vitro measurements. The same mechanism leads to actin networks consistent with measured filament, end, and branch concentrations. These networks undergo structural remodeling, leading to longer filaments away from the leading edge, at the +/- 35{degrees} orientation pattern. Imaging of actin speckle lifetimes at sub-second resolution verifies frequent disassembly of newly-assembled actin. We thus propose a unified mechanism that fits a diverse set of basic lamellipodia phenomenology.",

The TCR is composed of  and {beta} chains, encoded by the TRA and TRB genes, of which the variable regions determine antigen specificity. To generate novel biological insights into the complex functioning of immune cells, combined capture of variable regions and single-cell transcriptomes provides a compelling approach. Recent developments enable the enrichment of TRA and TRB variable regions from widely used technologies for 3-biased single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, a comprehensive computational pipeline to process TCR-enriched data from 3 scRNA-seq is not available. Here we present an analysis pipeline to process TCR variable regions enriched from 3 scRNA-seq cDNA. The tool reports TRA and TRB nucleotide and amino acid sequences linked to cell barcodes, enabling the reconstruction of T-cell clonotypes with associated transcriptomes. We demonstrate the software using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor and detect TCR sequences in a high proportion of single T-cells. Detection of TCR sequences is negligible in non-T-cell populations, demonstrating specificity. Finally, we show that TCR clones are larger in CD8 Memory T-cells than other T-cell types, indicating an association between T-cell clonotypes and differentiation states.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe Workflow for Association of T-cell receptors from 3 single-cell RNA-seq (WAT3R), including test data, is available on GitHub (https://github.com/mainciburu/WAT3R), Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/mainciburu/wat3r), and a workflow on the Terra platform (https://app.terra.bio).

In plants the circadian clock is conserved at both the level of transcriptional networks as well as core genes. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the core circadian singleMYB (sMYB) genes CCA1 and RVE4 are in genetic linkage with the PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) genes PRR9 and PRR7 respectively. Leveraging chromosome-resolved plant genomes and syntenic ortholog analysis it was possible to trace this genetic linkage back to the basal angiosperm Amborella and identify an additional evolutionarily conserved genetic linkage between PIF3 and PHYA. The LHY/CCA1-PRR5/9, RVE4/8-PRR3/7 and PIF3-PHYA genetic linkages emerged in the bryophyte lineage and progressively moved within several genes of each other across an array of higher plant families representing distinct whole genome duplication and fractionation events. Soybean maintains all but two genetic linkages, and expression analysis revealed the PIF3-PHYA linkage overlapping with the E4 maturity group locus was the only pair to robustly cycle with an evening phase in contrast to the sMYB-PRR morning and midday phase. While most monocots maintain the genetic linkages, they have been lost in the economically important grasses (Poaceae) such as maize where the genes have been fractionated to separate chromosomes and presence/absence variation results in the segregation of PRR7 paralogs across heterotic groups. The evolutionary conservation of the genetic linkage as well as its loss in the grasses provides new insight in the plant circadian clock, which has been a critical target of breeding and domestication.\n\nSummary SentenceThe genetic linkage of the core circadian clock components has evolutionary origins in bryophytes and sheds light on the current functioning and selection on the circadian clock in crops.",

Here, we investigated whether gut bacteria affect the progression of Huntingtons disease (HD) in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) models expressing human full-length or N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (HTT) protein, here referred to as HD flies. We find that elimination of commensal gut bacteria by antibiotics reduces the aggregation of amyloidogenic N-terminal fragments of HTT and delays the development of motor defects. Conversely, colonization of HD flies with Escherichia coli (E. coli), a known pathobiont of human gut with links to neurodegeneration, accelerates HTT aggregation, aggravates immobility and shortens lifespan. Similar to antibiotics, treatment of HD flies with small compounds such as luteolin, a flavone, or crocin a beta-carotenoid, ameliorates disease phenotypes and promotes survival. Crocin prevents colonization of E. coli in the gut and alters the abundance of commensal bacteria, which may be linked to its protective effects. The opposing effects of E. coli and crocin on HTT aggregation, motor defects and survival in transgenic Drosophila models support the involvement of gut-brain networks in the pathogenesis of HD.",

Here we present a computational model of the auditory pathway based on a deep neural network, trained on speech recognition. We simulate different levels of hearing loss and investigate the effect of intrinsic noise. Remarkably, speech recognition after hearing loss actually improves with additional intrinsic noise. This surprising result indicates that intrinsic noise might not only play a crucial role in human auditory processing, but might even be beneficial for contemporary machine learning approaches.",

The existing approaches to estimate SNP heritability can be broadly classified into two categories. One set of approaches model the SNP effects as fixed effects and the other treats the SNP effects as random effects. These methods make certain assumptions about the dependency among individuals (familial relationship) as well as the dependency among markers (linkage disequilibrium, LD) to provide consistent estimates of SNP heritability as the number of individuals increases. While various approaches have been proposed to account for such dependencies, it remains unclear which estimates reported in the literature are more robust against various model mis-specifications. Here we investigate the impact of different structures of LD and familial relatedness on heritability estimation. We show that the performance of different methods for heritability estimation depends heavily on the structure of the underlying pattern of LD and the degree of relatedness among sampled individuals. However, contrary to the claim in the current literature, we did not find significant differences in the performance of these fixed-SNP-effects and random-SNP-effects approaches. Moreover, we established the equivalence between the two method-of-moments estimators, one from each of these two lines of approaches.",

Arthropods often exhibit non-monotonous variation in abundance over time, making it important to account for temporal coverage in interpretation of abundance trends, which is often overlooked in statistical analysis. Combining four recently analysed datasets that led to contrasting outcomes, we first show that temporal abundance variations of arthropods are non-monotonous. Using simulations, we show non-monotony is likely to bias estimated linear abundance trends. Finally, analysing empirical data, we show that heterogeneity in estimated abundance trends is significantly related to the variation in temporal baseline of analysed time series. Once differences in baseline years, habitats and continents are accounted for, we do not find any statistical difference in estimated linear abundance trends among the four datasets. We also show that short time series produce more stochastic abundance trends than long series, making the dearth of old and long-term time series a strong limitation in the assessment of temporal trends in arthropod abundance. The lack of time series with a baseline year before global change acceleration is likely to lead to an underestimation of global change effects on biodiversity.",

The ST131 was more prevalent in human samples, and worryingly the high-risk ST131-C1-M27 was identified in human infections for the first time. We also detected CTX-M-55-producing E. coli ST117 isolates from meat samples (i.e., chicken and pork) and human infections. Moreover, we have identified the important clone CTX-M-24-positive E. coli ST354 from human samples in Brazil for the first time. In brief, our results suggest a potential of commercialized meat as a reservoir of high-priority E. coli lineages in the community. In contrast, the identification of E. coli ST131-C1-M27 indicates that novel pandemic clones have emerged in Brazil, constituting a public health issue.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Heterogeneity among cancer cells and in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is thought to be a significant contributor to the heterogeneity of clinical therapy response observed between patients and can evolve over time. A primary example of this is multiple myeloma (MM), a generally incurable cancer where such heterogeneity contributes to the persistent evolution of drug resistance. However, there is a paucity of functional assays for studying this heterogeneity in patient samples or for assessing the influence of the patient TME on therapy response. Indeed, the population-averaged data provided by traditional drug response assays and the large number of cells required for screening remain significant hurdles to advancement. To address these hurdles, we developed a suite of accessible technologies for quantifying functional drug response to a panel of therapies in ex vivo three-dimensional culture using small quantities of a patients own cancer and TME components. This suite includes tools for label-free single-cell identification and quantification of both cell division and death events with a standard brightfield microscope, an open-source software package for objective image analysis and feasible data management of multi-day timelapse experiments, and a new approach to fluorescent detection of cell death that is compatible with long-term imaging of primary cells. These new tools and capabilities are used to enable sensitive, objective, functional characterization of primary MM cell therapy response in the presence of TME components, laying the foundation for future studies and efforts to enable predictive assessment drug efficacy for individual patients.\n\nInsight BoxThe new tools and capabilities described here allow new insights into functional primary cell therapy response by (i) enabling more drugs to be tested on precious and limited numbers of patient cells ex vivo (ii) providing the ability to discriminate both cell division and death events over multiple days with single-cell resolution, and (iii) by incorporating the influences of a patients own cancer cells and TME components on drug response.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Macrophages are white blood cells of the innate immune system that play disparate roles in homeostasis and immune responses. As a result, they have the capability to alter their phenotypes to pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) subtypes in response to their environment. 8-15% of the macrophage transcriptome has circadian oscillations, including genes closely related to their functioning. As circadian rhythms are also associated with cellular phenotypes, we hypothesized that the polarization of macrophages to opposing subtypes might differently affect their circadian rhythms. We tested this by tracking the circadian rhythms of the mouse model macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, which was stably transfected with Bmal1:luc and Per2:luc reporters, representing a positive and a negative component of the core molecular clock. The strength of rhythmicity was assessed using three measures: the relative power of the circadian band in the power spectral density, the rhythmicity index computed as the height of the third peak of the correlogram, and the maximum value of the chi square periodorgram. The period and amplitudes of the de-trended, smoothed time-series were estimated both by fitting to a damped cosine curve and by identifying the peak and trough of each cycle. M1 polarization decreased amplitudes and rhythmicities of both Bmal1:luc and Per2:luc, but did not significantly affect periods, while M2 polarization increased periods and caused no substantial alterations to amplitudes or rhythmicity. As macrophage phenotypes are also altered in the presence of cancer cells, we then tested the circadian effects of conditioned media from two mouse breast cancer cell lines on macrophage circadian rhythms. Media from highly agressive 4T1 cells caused loss of rhythmicity, while media from less aggressive EMT6 cells yielded no changes. As macrophages are known to play roles in tumors, and oncogenic features are associated with circadian rhythms, we also tested whether conditioned media from macrophages can alter circadian rhythms of cancer cells. We found that conditioned media from RAW 264.7 cells resulted in lower circadian rhythmicities and periods, but higher circadian amplitudes in human osteosarcoma, U2OS-Per2:luc cells. Taken together, our study shows that different circadian characteristics exist based on macrophage phenotypes, and suggests further that there is an association between circadian rhythms and macrophage polarization state. Additionally, our data shows that macrophages treated with breast cancer-conditioned media have circadian phenotypes similar to those of the M1 subtype, and cancer cells treated with macrophage-conditioned media have circadian alterations, providing insight to another level of cross-talk between macrophages and cancer cells that merits further investigation.",

Our simulations are motivated by bacterial microcompartments, which are protein shells found in bacteria that assemble around a complex of enzymes and other components involved in certain metabolic processes. The simulations demonstrate that the relative interaction strengths among the different cargo species play a key role in determining the amount of each species that is encapsulated, their spatial organization, and the nature of the shell assembly pathways. However, the shell protein-shell protein and shell protein-cargo component interactions that help drive assembly and encapsulation also influence cargo composition within certain parameter regimes. These behaviors are governed by a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In addition to elucidating how natural microcompartments encapsulate multiple components involved within reaction cascades, these results have implications for efforts in synthetic biology to colocalize alternative sets of molecules within microcompartments to accelerate specific reactions. More broadly, the results suggest that coupling between self-assembly and multicomponent liquid-liquid phase separation may play a role in the organization of the cellular cytoplasm.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Compulsivity is a common phenotype amongst various psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and gambling disorder (GD). Deficiencies in metacognition, such as the inability to properly estimate ones own performance via well-calibrated confidence judgments could contribute to pathological decision-making in these psychiatric disorders. Earlier research has indeed suggested that OCD and GD patients reside at opposite ends of the confidence spectrum, with OCD patients exhibiting underconfidence, and GD patients exhibiting overconfidence. Recently, several studies established that motivational states (e.g. monetary incentives) influence metacognition, with gain (respectively loss) prospects increasing (respectively decreasing) confidence judgments. Here, we reasoned that the OCD and GD symptomatology might correspond to an exacerbation of this interaction between metacognition and motivational states. We hypothesized GDs overconfidence to be exaggerated during gain prospects, while OCDs underconfidence to be worsened in loss context, which we expected to see represented in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity. We tested those hypotheses in a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Our initial analyses showed increased confidence levels for GD versus OCD patients, that could partly be explained by sex and IQ. Although our primary analyses did not support the hypothesized interaction between incentives and groups, exploratory analyses did show increased confidence in GD patients specifically in gain context. fMRI analyses confirmed a central role for VMPFC in the processing of confidence and incentives, but with no differences between the clinical samples. The trial is registered in the Dutch Trial Register (Trial NL6171, registration number: NTR6318) (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/6171).",

Persisting micropollutants can impact multiple generations of organisms, but their microbially-mediated degradation and their influence on community assembly remain understudied. Here, freshwater microbes were treated with several common micropollutants, alone or in combination, and then transferred every 5 days to fresh medium containing the same micropollutants to mimic the repeated exposure of microbes. Metabarcoding of 16S rRNA gene makers was chosen to study the succession of bacterial assemblages following micropollutant exposure. The removal rates of micropollutants were then measured to assess degradation capacity of the associated communities. The degradation of micropollutants did not accelerate over time but altered the microbial community composition. Community assembly was dominated by stochastic processes during early exposure, via random community changes and emergence of seedbanks, and deterministic processes later in the exposure, via advanced community succession. Early exposure stages were characterized by the presence of sensitive microorganisms such as Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes, which were then replaced by more tolerant bacteria such as Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria. Our findings have important implication for ecological feedback between microbe-micropollutants under anthropogenic climate change scenarios.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Oxytocin has become a popular analyte in behavioral endocrinology in recent years, due in part to its roles in social behavior, stress physiology, and cognition. Urine samples have the advantage of being non-invasive and minimally disruptive to collect, allowing for oxytocin measurements even in some wild populations. However, methods for urinary oxytocin immunoassay have not been sufficiently optimized and rigorously assessed for their potential limitations. Using samples from oxytocin knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice, we find evidence of considerable interference in unextracted urine samples, with similar distributions of measured oxytocin in both genotypes. Importantly, although this interference can be reduced by a reversed-phase solid-phase extraction (SPE), this common approach is not sufficient for eliminating false-positive signal on three immunoassay kits. To better understand the source of the observed interference, we conducted epitope mapping of the Arbor Assays antibody and assessed its cross-reactivity with known, biologically active fragments of oxytocin. We found considerable cross-reactivity (0.5-52% by-molarity) for three fragments of oxytocin that share the core epitope, with more cross-reactivity for longer fragments. Given the presence of some cross-reactivity for even the tripeptide MIF-1, it is likely that many small protein metabolites might be sufficiently similar to the epitope that at high concentrations they interfere with immunoassays. We present a new mixed-mode cation-exchange SPE method that minimizes interference--with knockout samples measuring below the assays limit of detection--while effectively retaining oxytocin from the urine of wildtype mice. This method demonstrates good parallelism and spike recovery across multiple species (mice, dogs, sifakas, humans). Our results suggest that immunoassays of urine samples may be particularly susceptible to interference, even when using common extraction protocols, but that this interference can be successfully managed using a novel mixed-mode cation exchange extraction.",

It is currently unknown how the location of replication origins and the timing of their activation is determined in the human genome. Here, we dissect the role for G1 phase topologically associating domains (TADs), subTADs, and loops in the activation of replication initiation zones (IZs). We identify twelve subtypes of self-interacting chromatin domains distinguished by their degree of nesting, the presence of corner dot structures indicative of loops, and their co-localization with A/B compartments. Early replicating IZs localize to boundaries of nested corner-dot TAD/subTADs anchored by high density arrays of co-occupied CTCF+cohesin binding sites with divergently oriented motifs. By contrast, late replicating IZs localize to weak TADs/subTAD boundaries devoid of corner dots and most often anchored by singlet CTCF+cohesin sites. Upon global knock-down of cohesin-mediated loops in G1, early wave focal IZs replicate later in S phase and convert to diffuse placement along the genome. Moreover, IZs in mid-late S phase are delayed to the final minutes before entry into G2 when cohesin-mediated dot-less boundaries are ablated. We also delete a specific loop anchor and observe a sharp local delay of an early wave IZ to replication in late S phase. Our data demonstrate that cohesin-mediated loops at genetically-encoded TAD/subTAD boundaries in G1 phase are an essential determinant of the precise genomic placement of human replication origins in S phase.",

However, because RNA degrades much more easily than DNA, the logistics of obtaining fresh tissues has become a major limiting factor for widely applying this method. Here, we used Ranunculaceae to test whether silica-dried plant tissues could be used for RNA extraction and subsequent phylogenomic studies. We sequenced 27 transcriptomes, 21 from silica gel-dried (SD-samples) and six from liquid nitrogen-preserved (LN-samples) leaf tissues, and downloaded 27 additional transcriptomes from GenBank. Our results showed that although the LN-samples produced slightly better reads than the SD-samples, there were no significant differences in RNA quality and quantity, assembled contig lengths and numbers, and BUSCO comparisons between two treatments. Using this data, we conducted phylogenomic analyses, including concatenated- and coalescent-based phylogenetic reconstruction, molecular dating, coalescent simulation, phylogenetic network estimation, and whole genome duplication (WGD) inference. The resulting phylogeny was consistent with previous studies with higher resolution and statistical support. The 11 core Ranunculaceae tribes grouped into two chromosome type clades (T- and R-types), with high support. Discordance among gene trees is likely due to hybridization and introgression, ancient genetic polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting. Our results strongly support one ancient hybridization event within the R-type clade and three WGD events in Ranunculales. Evolution of the three Ranunculaceae chromosome types is likely not directly related to WGD events. By clearly resolving the Ranunculaceae phylogeny, we demonstrated that SD-samples can be used for RNA-seq and phylotranscriptomic studies of angiosperms.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Navigation through dense, physically confining extracellular matrix is common in invasive cell spread and tissue re-organization, but is still poorly understood. Here, we show that this migration is mediated by cyclic changes in the activity of a small GTP-ase RhoA, dependent on the oscillatory changes in the activity and abundance of the RhoA Guanine Exchange Factor, GEF-H1, triggered by a persistent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ levels. We show that the molecular clock driving these cyclic changes is mediated by two coupled negative feedback loops, dependent on the microtubule dynamics, with the frequency that can be experimentally modulated based on a predictive mathematical model. We further demonstrate that an increasing frequency of the clock translates into a faster cell migration within physically confining spaces. This work lays the foundation for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms dynamically driving cell migration in complex environments.",

In this work, we show that spatial sensing and navigation can be optimized by adapting the spatial organization of signaling pathways to the spatial structure of the environment. We develop an information-theoretic framework for computing the optimal spatial organization of a sensing system for a given signaling environment. We find that receptor localization maximizes information acquisition in simulated natural contexts, including tissue and soil. Receptor localization extends naturally to produce a dynamic protocol for continuously redistributing signaling receptors, which when implemented using simple feedback, boosts cell navigation efficiency by 30-fold. Broadly, our work shows how cells can maximize the fidelity of information transfer by adapting the spatial organization of signaling molecules to the spatial structure of the environment.",

Based on the evidence from multiple technologies combined with extensive experimental validation, including Bionano optical mapping data and targeted detection of candidate breakpoint junctions, we compiled a comprehensive set of true somatic SVs, comprising all SV types. We demonstrate the utility of this resource by determining the SV detection performance of each technology as a function of tumor purity and sequence depth, highlighting the importance of assessing these parameters in cancer genomics projects and data analysis tool evaluation.

However, due to the limited efficiency of available computational tools, deterministic simulations of movement focus on accurately modelling the musculoskeletal system while neglecting physiological noise, and stochastic simulations account for noise while simplifying the dynamics. We took advantage of recent approaches where stochastic optimal control problems are approximated using deterministic optimal control problems, which can be solved efficiently using direct collocation. We were thus able to extend predictions of stochastic optimal control as a theory of motor coordination to include muscle coordination and movement patterns emerging from non-linear musculoskeletal dynamics. In stochastic optimal control simulations of human standing balance, we demonstrated that the inclusion of muscle dynamics can predict muscle co-contraction as minimal effort strategy that complements sensorimotor feedback control in the presence of sensory noise. In simulations of reaching, we demonstrated that nonlinear multi-segment musculoskeletal dynamics enables complex perturbed and unperturbed reach trajectories under a variety of task conditions to be predicted. In both behaviors, we demonstrated how interactions between task constraint, sensory noise, and the intrinsic properties of muscle influence optimal muscle coordination patterns, including muscle co-contraction, and the resulting movement trajectories. Our approach enables a true minimum effort solution to be identified as task constraints, such as movement accuracy, can be explicitly imposed, rather than being approximated using penalty terms in the cost function. Our approximate stochastic optimal control framework predicts complex features, not captured by previous simulation approaches, providing a generalizable and valuable tool to study how musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise may alter neural control of movement in both healthy and pathological movements.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Developing novel methods for the analysis of intracellular signaling networks is essential for understanding interconnected biological processes that underlie complex human disorders. A fundamental goal of this research is to quantify the vulnerability of a signaling network to the dysfunction of one or multiple molecules, when the dysfunction is defined as an incorrect response to the input signals. In this study, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify the extreme signaling failures that can induce the most detrimental impact on the physiological function of a molecular network. The algorithm basically finds the molecules, or groups of molecules, with the maximum vulnerability, i.e., the highest probability of causing the network failure, when they are dysfunctional. We propose another algorithm that efficiently accounts for signaling feedbacks in this analysis. The algorithms are tested on two experimentally verified ERBB and T cell signaling networks. Surprisingly, results reveal that as the number of concurrently dysfunctional molecules increases, the maximum vulnerability values quickly reach to a plateau following an initial increase. This suggests the specificity of vulnerable molecule (s) involved, as a specific number of faulty molecules cause the most detrimental damage to the function of the network. Increasing a random number of simultaneously faulty molecules does not further deteriorate the function of the network. Such a group of specific molecules whose dysfunction causes the extreme signaling failures can better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of complex trait disorders, and can offer new insights for the development of novel therapeutics.",

Understanding polar bear evolutionary history may provide insights into apex carnivore responses and prospects during periods of extreme environmental perturbations. In recent years, genomic studies have examined bear speciation and population history, including evidence for ancient admixture between polar bears and brown bears (Ursus arctos). Here, we extend our earlier studies of a 130,000-115,000-year-old polar bear from the Svalbard Archipelago using a 10X coverage genome sequence and ten new genomes of polar and brown bears from contemporary zones of overlap in northern Alaska. We demonstrate a dramatic decline in effective population size for this ancient polar bears lineage, followed by a modest increase just before its demise. A slightly higher genetic diversity in the ancient polar bear suggests a severe genetic erosion over a prolonged bottleneck in modern polar bears. Statistical fitting of data to alternative admixture graph scenarios favors at least one ancient introgression event from brown bears into the ancestor of polar bears, possibly dating back over 150,000 years. Gene flow was likely bidirectional, but allelic transfer from brown into polar bear is the strongest detected signal, which contrasts with other published works. These findings may have implications for our understanding of climate change impacts: polar bears, a specialist Arctic lineage, may not only have undergone severe genetic bottlenecks, but also been the recipient of generalist, boreal genetic variants from brown bear during critical phases of Northern Hemisphere glacial oscillations.\n\nSignificanceInterspecific hybridization is a widespread phenomenon, but measuring its extent, directionality, and adaptive importance remains challenging. Ancient genomes, however, can help illuminate the history of modern organisms. Here, we present a genome retrieved from a 130,000-115,000-year-old polar bear and perform genome analyses of modern polar and brown bears throughout their geographic range. We find that the principal direction of ancient allele sharing was from brown bear into polar bear, although gene flow between them has likely been bidirectional. This inverts the current paradigm of unidirectional gene flow from polar into brown bear, and it suggests that polar bears were recipients of external genetic variation prior to their extensive population decline.",

They serve as a resource of biological knowledge for bioinformatics analyses, and also comprise the subsequent results. However, the interpretation of biological networks is challenging and requires suitable visualizations dependent on the contained information. The most prominent software in the field for the visualization of biological networks is Cytoscape, a desktop modeling environment also including many features for analysis.\n\nA further challenge when working with networks is their distribution. Within a typical collaborative workflow, even slight changes of the network data force one to repeat the visualization step as well. Also, just minor adjustments to the visual representation not only need the networks to be transferred back and forth. Collaboration on the same resources requires specific infrastructure to avoid redundancies, or worse, the corruption of the data. A well-established solution is provided by the NDEx platform where users can upload a network, share it with selected colleagues or make it publicly available.\n\nNDExEdit is a web-based application where simple changes can be made to biological networks within the browser, and which does not require installation. With our tool, plain networks can be enhanced easily for further usage in presentations and publications. Since the network data is only stored locally within the web browser, users can edit their private networks without concerns of unintentional publication. The web tool is designed to conform to the Cytoscape Exchange (CX) format as a data model, which is used for the data transmission by both tools, Cytoscape and NDEx. Therefore the modified network can be exported as a compatible CX file, additionally to standard image formats like PNG and JPEG.\n\nAuthor summaryRelations in biological research are often visualized as networks. For instance, if two proteins interact with each other during a certain process, the corresponding network would show two nodes connected by one edge. But the fact that the interaction between the two exists, may not be enough. With established software solutions like Cytoscape we can add all the information we have about our nodes and their interaction to our data foundation. Furthermore, we can change the visual appearance of our nodes and their interaction based on this information.\n\nFor example, if our network contains 20 nodes, that all interact with each other, but the strength of these interactions each range between 0 and 1, we can illustrate that by making the edges wider for strong interactions and slimmer for weak interactions. Thus, our visualization is enriched with valuable information. As of now these data-dependent modifications can only be made with a desktop client.\n\nWe introduce NDExEdit, a web-based solution for visualization changes to networks that conform to the CX data format. It allows us to import networks directly from the NDEx platform and apply changes to the visualization - including all types of mappings, one of which was briefly described above.",

Limited correlation between disease phenotypes and CRB1 alleles, and evidence that patients sharing the same alleles often present with different disease features, suggest that genetic modifiers contribute to clinical variation. Similarly, the retinal phenotype of mice bearing the Crb1 retinal degeneration 8 (rd8) allele varies with genetic background. Here, we initiated a sensitized chemical mutagenesis screen in B6.Cg-Crb1rd8/Pjn, a strain with a mild clinical presentation, to identify genetic modifiers that cause a more severe disease phenotype. Two models from this screen, Tvrm266 and Tvrm323, exhibited increased retinal dysplasia. Genetic mapping with high-throughput exome and candidate-gene sequencing identified causative mutations in Arhgef12 and Prkci, respectively. Epistasis analysis of both strains indicated that the increased dysplastic phenotype required homozygosity of the Crb1rd8 allele. Retinal dysplastic lesions in Tvrm266 mice were smaller and caused less photoreceptor degeneration than those in Tvrm323 mice, which developed an early, large diffuse lesion phenotype. In both models at one month of age, Muller glia and microglia mislocalization at dysplastic lesions was similar to that in B6.Cg-Crb1rd8/Pjn mice, while photoreceptor cell mislocalization was more extensive. External limiting membrane disruption was comparable in Tvrm266 and B6.Cg- Crb1rd8/Pjn mice but milder in Tvrm323 mice. Immunohistological analysis of mice at postnatal day 0 indicated a normal distribution of mitotic cells in Tvrm266 and Tvrm323 mice, suggesting normal early development. Aberrant electroretinography responses were observed in both models but functional decline was significant only in Tvrm323 mice. These results identify Arhgef12 and Prkci as modifier genes that differentially shape Crb1-associated retinal disease, which may be relevant to understanding clinical variability and underlying disease mechanisms.",

We detected a downregulation of mRNAs bound by FMRP and this effect is prominent in neurons. Metabolic pathways including translation are significantly upregulated across all cell types with the notable exception of excitatory neurons. These effects point to a potential difference in the activity of mTOR pathways, and together with other dysregulated pathways suggest an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the FXS cortex which is exacerbated by astrocytes.

    "preprint_abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) preferentially infects conducting airway and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung. The outcome of these infections is impacted by the host response, including the production of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF9) is required for lung development, can display antiviral activity in vitro, and is upregulated in asymptomatic patients during early IAV infection. We therefore hypothesized that FGF9 would protect the lungs from respiratory virus infection and evaluated IAV pathogenesis in mice that overexpress FGF9 in club cells in the conducting airway epithelium (FGF9-OE mice). However, we found that FGF9-OE mice were highly susceptible to IAV and Sendai virus infection compared to control mice. FGF9-OE mice displayed elevated and persistent viral loads, increased expression of cytokines and chemokines, and increased numbers of infiltrating immune cells as early as 1 day post-infection (dpi). Gene expression analysis showed an elevated type I interferon (IFN) signature in the conducting airway epithelium and analysis of IAV tropism uncovered a dramatic shift in infection from the conducting airway epithelium to the alveolar epithelium in FGF9-OE lungs. These results demonstrate that FGF9 signaling primes the conducting airway epithelium to rapidly induce a localized, protective IFN and proinflammatory cytokine response during viral infection. Although this response protects the airway epithelial cells from IAV infection, it allows for early and enhanced infection of the alveolar epithelium, ultimately leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Our study illuminates a novel role for FGF9 in regulating respiratory virus infection and pathogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryInfluenza viruses are respiratory viruses that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the lungs, influenza A virus primarily infects epithelial cells that line the conducting airways and alveoli. Fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF9) is a growth factor that has been shown to have antiviral activity and is upregulated during early IAV infection in asymptomatic patients, leading us to hypothesize that FGF9 would protect the lung epithelium from IAV infection. However, mice that express and secrete FGF9 from club cells in the conducting airway had more severe respiratory virus infection and a hyperactive inflammatory immune response as early as 1 day post-infection. Analysis of the FGF9-expressing airway epithelial cells found an elevated antiviral and inflammatory interferon signature, which protected these cells from severe IAV infection. However, heightened infection of alveolar cells resulted in excessive inflammation in the alveoli, resulting in more severe disease and death. Our study identifies a novel antiviral and inflammatory role for FGFs in the lung airway epithelium and confirms that early and robust IAV infection of alveolar cells results in more severe disease.",

A key player in this cascade is the chromatin remodelling complex SWR1, which replaces the canonical histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z. Transcriptional regulation of polycistronic transcription units in the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei has been shown to be highly dependent on acetylation of H2A.Z, which is mediated by the histone-acetyltransferase HAT2. The chromatin remodelling complex which mediates H2A.Z incorporation is not known and an SWR1 orthologue in trypanosomes has not yet been reported.\n\nIn this study, we identified and characterised an SWR1-like remodeller complex in T. brucei that is responsible for Pol II-dependent transcriptional regulation. Bioinformatic analysis of potential SNF2 DEAD/Box helicases, the key component of SWR1 complexes, identified a 1211 amino acids-long protein that exhibits key structural characteristics of the SWR1 subfamily. Systematic protein-protein interaction analysis revealed the existence of a novel complex exhibiting key features of an SWR1-like chromatin remodeller. RNAi-mediated depletion of the ATPase subunit of this complex resulted in a significant reduction of H2A.Z incorporation at transcription start sites and a subsequent decrease of steady-state mRNA levels. Furthermore, depletion of SWR1 and RNA-polymerase II (Pol II) caused massive chromatin condensation. The potential function of several proteins associated with the SWR1-like complex and with HAT2, the key factor of H2A.Z incorporation, is discussed.\n\nAuthor summaryTrypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in humans and nagana in cattle. Its unusual genomic organisation featuring large polycistronic units requires a general mechanism of transcription initiation, because individual gene promoters are mostly absent. Despite the fact that the histone variant H2A.Z has previously been identified as a key player of transcription regulation, the complex responsible for correct H2A.Z incorporation at transcription start sites (TSS) remains elusive. In other eukaryotes, SWR1, a SNF2 ATPase-associated chromatin remodelling complex, is responsible for correct incorporation of this histone variant. This study identified a SWR1-like complex in T. brucei. Depletion of the SNF2 ATPase resulted in a reduction of H2A.Z incorporation at the TSS and decreased steady-state mRNA levels accompanied by chromatin condensation. In addition to the SWR1-like complex, we also identified a trypanosome-specific HAT2 complex that includes the histone acetyltransferases HAT2, a key player in the H2A.Z incorporation process. This complex has a trypanosome-specific composition that is different from the NuA4/TIP60 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

However, it is unclear whether such a high fidelity representational advantage is maintained when foveal image locations are committed to short term memory. Here we describe a paradoxically large distortion in foveal target location recall by humans. We briefly presented small, but high contrast, points of light at eccentricities ranging from 0.1 to 12 deg, while subjects maintained their line of sight on a stable target. After a brief memory period, the subjects indicated the remembered target locations via computer controlled cursors. The biggest localization errors, in terms of both directional deviations and amplitude percentage overshoots or undershoots, occurred for the most foveal targets, and such distortions were still present, albeit with qualitatively different patterns, when subjects shifted their gaze to indicate the remembered target locations. Foveal visual images are severely distorted in short term memory.",

Similar to conventional optical microscopy, the axial resolution is by a factor three to five worse than the lateral resolution. One recently developed method to close this gap is metal-induced energy transfer (MIET) imaging which achieves an axial resolution down to nanometers. It exploits the distance dependent quenching of fluorescence when a fluorescent molecule is brought close to a metal surface. In the present manuscript, we combine the extreme axial resolution of MIET imaging with the extraordinary lateral resolution of single-molecule localization microscopy, in particular with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). This combination allows us to achieve isotropic three-dimensional super-resolution imaging of sub-cellular structures. Moreover, we employed spectral demixing for implementing dualcolor MIET-dSTORM that allows us to image and co-localize, in three dimensions, two different cellular structures simultaneously.",

It remains unclear if the long-term response is associated with the characteristics of CAR T cells in infusion products, hindering the identification of biomarkers to predict therapeutic outcomes prior to treatment. Herein we present 101,326 single cell transcriptomes and surface protein landscape from the CAR T infusion products of 12 pediatric ALL patients upon CAR antigen-specific stimulation in comparison with TCR-mediated activation and controls. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the antigen-specific activation states, among which a deficiency of Th2 function was associated with CD19-positive relapsed patients (median remission 9.6 months) compared with very durable responders (remission>54 months). Proteomic profiles also revealed that the frequency of early memory T cell subsets, rather than activation or co-inhibitory signatures could distinguish CD19-positive relapse. Additionally, a deficit of type 1 helper and cytotoxic effector function and an enrichment for terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells exhibiting low cytokine polyfunctionality was associated with initial non-responders. By contrast, the single-cell transcriptomic data of unstimulated or TCR-activated CAR T cells failed to predict clinical responses. In aggregate, our results dissect the landscape of CAR-specific activation states in infusion products that can identify patients who do not develop a durable response to the therapy, and unveil the molecular mechanisms that may inform strategies to boost specific T cell function to maintain long term remission.",

Our experiments and theoretical analysis revealed that the balance of membrane binding and dissociation from the membrane of MinD determines the mode selection of the Min wave. We successfully demonstrated that the transition of the wave modes can be regulated by controlling this balance and found hysteresis characteristics in the wave mode transition.

Here, we conducted four psychophysical experiments with separate groups of participants to investigate the possibility of preventing the interference in short-term perceptual training. We trained the participants to detect two orientations of Gabor stimuli in two adjacent days at the same retinal location and examined the interference of training effects between the two orientations. The results showed significant retroactive interference from the second orientation to the first orientation (Experiments 1 and 2). Introducing a 6-hour interval between the pre-test and training of the second orientation did not eliminate the interference effect, excluding the interpretation of disrupted reconsolidation as the pre-test of the second orientation may reactivate and destabilize the representation of the first orientation (Experiment 3). Finally, the training of the two orientations was accompanied by fixations in two colors, each served as a contextual cue for one orientation. The results showed that the retroactive interference was not evident after introducing these passively perceived contextual cues (Experiment 4). Our findings suggest that the retroactive interference effect in short-term perceptual training of orientation detection tasks was likely the result of higher-level factors such as shared contextual cues embedded in the tasks. The effect of multiple perceptual training could be facilitated by associating the trained tasks with different contextual cues.",

Linked-read whole-genome sequencing (lrWGS) allows for refined detection and reconstruction of SVs by providing long-range genetic information from standard short-read sequencing. This makes lrWGS an attractive solution for capturing the full genomic complexity of MM. Here we show that high-quality lrWGS data can be generated from low numbers of FACS sorted cells without DNA purification. Using this protocol, we analyzed FACS sorted MM cells from 37 MM patients with lrWGS. We found high concordance between lrWGS and FISH for the detection of recurrent translocations and CNVs. Outside of the regions investigated by FISH, we identified >150 additional SVs and CNVs across the cohort. Analysis of the lrWGS data allowed for resolving the structure of diverse SVs affecting the MYC and t(11;14) loci causing the duplication of genes and gene regulatory elements. In addition, we identified private SVs causing the dysregulation of genes recurrently involved in translocations with the IGH locus and show that these can alter the molecular classification of the MM. Overall, we conclude that lrWGS allows for the detection of aberrations critical for MM prognostics and provides a feasible route for providing comprehensive genetics. Implementing lrWGS could provide more accurate clinical prognostics, facilitate genomic medicine initiatives, and greatly improve the stratification of patients included in clinical trials.\n\nKEY POINTS- Linked-read WGS can be performed without DNA purification and allows for resolving the diverse structural variants found in multiple myeloma.\n- Linked-read WGS can, as a stand-alone assay, provide comprehensive genetics in myeloma and other diseases with complex genomes.",

Whether these fluctuations are instrumental or epiphenomenal to the behavior remains elusive. Attempts to experimentally manipulate neural oscillations exogenously using non-invasive brain stimulation have shown some promise, but difficulty with tailoring stimulation parameters to individuals has hindered progress in this field. We demonstrate here using electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in a brain-computer interface that human participants (n=44) learned over multiple sessions across a 6-day period to self-regulate their Beta rhythm (13-20 Hz) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC). The modulation was evident only during neurofeedback task performance but did not lead to offline alteration of Beta rhythm characteristics at rest, nor to changes in subsequent cognitive behavior. Likewise, a control group (n=38) who underwent training of the Alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) did not exhibit behavioral changes. Although the right frontal Beta rhythm has been repeatedly implicated as a key component of the brains inhibitory control system, the present data suggest that its manipulation offline prior to cognitive task performance does not result in behavioral change. Thus, this form of neurofeedback training of the tonic Beta rhythm would not serve as a useful therapeutic target for disorders with dysfunctional inhibitory control as their basis.",

Genetic, environmental, and other stresses can induce protein mistargeting, and in turn threaten cellular protein homeostasis. Current methods for measuring protein mistargeting are difficult to translate to living cells, and thus the role of cellular signaling networks in stress-dependent protein mistargeting processes, such as ER pre-emptive quality control (ER pQC), are difficult to parse. Herein, we use genetically encoded peroxidases to characterize protein import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We show that the ERHRP/cytAPEX pair provides good selectivity and sensitivity for identifying protein mistargeting, using the known ER pQC substrate transthyretin (TTR). Although ERHRP labeling induces formation of detergent-resistant TTR aggregates, this is minimized by using low ERHRP expression, without loss of labeling efficiency. cytAPEX labeling recovers TTR that is mistargeted as a consequence of Sec61 inhibition or ER stress-induced ER pQC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stress-free activation of the ER stress-associated transcription factor ATF6 recapitulates the TTR import deficiency of ER pQC. Hence, proximity labeling is an effective strategy for characterizing factors that influence ER protein import in living cells.",

Both species exhibit extraordinary longevity for their body size, high tolerance to hypoxia and oxidative stress and high reproductive output; these collectively defy the concept that all life-history traits should be negatively correlated. However, when life-history traits share similar underpinning physiological mechanisms, these may be positively associated with each other. Here, we propose that the bioenergetic properties of mole-rats share a potential common mechanism. We adopted a top-down perspective measuring the bioenergetic properties at the organismal, cellular, and molecular level in both species and the biological significance of these properties were compared with the same measures in Siberian hamsters and C57BL/6 mice, chosen for their similar body size to the mole-rat species. We found mole-rats shared several bioenergetic properties that differed from their comparator species, including low basal metabolic rates, a high dependence on glycolysis rather than on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production, and low proton conductance across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These shared mole-rat features could be a result of evolutionary adaptation to tolerating variable oxygen atmospheres, in particular hypoxia, and may in turn be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying their extremely long lifespans.",

Its activation by cGAMP upon the presence of cytosolic DNA stimulates the production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines which are crucial for protecting cells from infections. STING signaling pathway can also influence both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting mechanisms, rendering it an appealing target for drug design. In the human population, several STING variants exist and exhibit dramatic differences in their activity, impacting the efficiency of the host defense against infections. Understanding the differential molecular mechanisms exhibited by these variants is of utmost importance notably towards personalized medicine treatments against diseases such as viral infections (COVID-19, Dengue...), cancers, or auto-inflammatory diseases. Owing to micro-seconds scale molecular modeling simulations and post-processing by contacts analysis and Machine Learning techniques, we reveal the dynamical behavior of four STING variants (wild type, G230A, R293Q, and G230A-R293Q) and we rationalize the variability of efficiency observed experimentally. Our results show that the decrease of STING activity is linked to a stiffening of key-structural features of the binding cavity, together with changes of the interaction patterns within the protein.",

We hypothesized that young genes are subject to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation to limit their expression and minimize their exposure to purifying selection. We found that young genes in rice have relatively low expression levels, which can be attributed to distal enhancers, and closed chromatin conformation at their transcription start sites (TSS). The chromatin in TSS regions can be re-modeled in response to abiotic stress, indicating conditional expression of young genes. Furthermore, transcripts of young genes in Arabidopsis tend to be targeted by nonsense-mediated RNA decay, presenting another layer of regulation limiting their expression. Together, these data suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to the conditional expression of young genes, which may alleviate purging selection while providing an opportunity for phenotypic exposure and functionalization.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Serotonergic psychedelics are being studied as novel treatments for mental health disorders and as facilitators of improved well-being, mental function and creativity. Recent studies have found mixed results concerning the effects of low doses of psychedelics (\"microdosing\") on these domains. However, microdosing is generally investigated using instruments designed to assess larger doses of psychedelics, which might lack sensitivity and specificity for this purpose. Following a double-blind and placebo-controlled experimental design, we explored natural language as a resource to identify speech produced under the acute effects of psilocybin microdoses, focusing on variables known to be affected by higher doses: verbosity, semantic variability and sentiment scores. Except for semantic variability, these metrics presented significant differences between a typical active microdose of 0.5 g of psilocybin mushrooms and an inactive placebo condition. Moreover, machine learning classifiers trained using these metrics were capable of distinguishing between conditions with high accuracy (AUC{approx}0.8). Our results constitute first proof that low doses of serotonergic psychedelics can be identified from unconstrained natural speech, with potential for widely applicable, affordable, and ecologically valid monitoring of microdosing schedules.",

The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF) recognizes distressed RNAPs and either rescues transcription or initiates transcription termination. Precisely how TRCFs choose to execute either outcome remains unclear. With Escherichia coli as a model, we used single-molecule assays to study dynamic modulation of elongation by Mfd, the bacterial TRCF. We found that nucleotide-bound Mfd converts the elongation complex (EC) into a catalytically poised state, presenting the EC with an opportunity to restart transcription. After long-lived residence in this catalytically poised state, ATP hydrolysis by Mfd remodels the EC through an irreversible process leading to loss of the RNA transcript. Further, biophysical studies revealed that the motor domain of Mfd binds and partially melts DNA containing a template strand overhang. The results explain pathway choice determining the fate of the EC and provide a molecular mechanism for transcription modulation by TRCF.",

A number of approaches have been developed to extract the lifetime from time-domain FLIM data, but they are often limited in terms of dynamic range, speed, photon efficiency or precision. Here, we focus on one of the best performing methods in the field, the center-of-mass (CMM) method, that conveys advantages in terms of speed and photon efficiency over others. In this paper, however, we identify a loss of photon efficiency of CMM for short lifetimes when background noise is present. We sub-sequently present a new development and generalization of the CMM method that provides for the rapid and accurate extraction of fluorescence lifetime over a large lifetime dynamic range. We provide software tools to simulate, validate and analyze FLIM data sets and compare the performance of our approach against the standard CMM and the commonly employed leastsquare minimization (LSM) methods. Our method features a better photon efficiency than standard CMM and LSM and is robust in the presence of background noise. The algorithm is applicable to any time-domain FLIM dataset.",

In addition, the genetic and metabolic properties supporting symbiotic nitrogen fixation often differ between compatible partners, including those sharing a common partner, highlighting the need for multiple study systems. Here, we report high quality nodule transcriptome assemblies for Medicago sativa cv. Algonquin and Melilotus officinalis, two legumes able to form compatible symbioses with Sinorhizobium meliloti. The compressed M. sativa and M. officinalis assemblies consisted of 79,978 and 64,593 contigs, respectively, of which 33,341 and 28,278 were assigned putative annotations, respectively. As expected, the two transcriptomes showed broad similarity at a global level. We were particularly interested in the NCR peptide profiles of these plants, as these peptides drive bacterial differentiation during the symbiosis. A total of 412 and 308 NCR peptides were predicted from the M. sativa and M. officinalis transcriptomes, respectively, with approximately 9% of the transcriptome of both species consisting of NCR transcripts. Notably, transcripts encoding highly-cationic NCR peptides (isoelectric point > 9.5), which are known to have antimicrobial properties, were ~2-fold more abundant in M. sativa than in M. officinalis, and ~27-fold more abundant when considering only NCR peptides in the six-cysteine class. We hypothesize that the difference in abundance of highly-cationic NCR peptides explains our previous observation that some rhizobial bacA alleles which can support symbiosis with M. officinalis are unable to support symbiosis with M. sativa.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Errors and their consequences are typically studied by investigating changes in decision speed and accuracy in trials that follow an error, commonly referred to as \"post-error adjustments\". Many studies have reported that subjects slow down following an error, a phenomenon called \"post-error slowing\" (PES). However, the functional significance of PES is still a matter of debate as it is not always adaptive. That is, it is not always associated with a gain in performance and can even occur with a decline in accuracy. Here, we hypothesized that the nature of PES is influenced by ones speed-accuracy tradeoff policy, which determines the overall level of choice accuracy in the task at hand. To test this hypothesis, we investigated post-error adjustments in subjects performing the same task while they were required to either emphasize speed (low accuracy) or cautiousness (high accuracy) in two distinct contexts (hasty and cautious contexts, respectively) experienced on separate days. Accordingly, our data indicate that post-error adjustments varied according to the context in which subjects performed the task, with PES being solely significant in the hasty context. In addition, we only observed a gain in performance after errors in a specific trial type, suggesting that post-error adjustments depend on a complex combination of processes that affect the speed of ensuing actions as well as the degree to which such PES comes with a gain in performance.",

By gauging the distances to multiple points on the surrounding object surfaces, LiDAR acquires 3D point clouds from which tree sizes and spatial distributions can be rapidly estimated. However, the high cost and specialized skills associated with LiDAR technologies have put them out of reach for many potential users.\nC_LIO_LIWe here introduce ForestScanner, a free, mobile application that allows LiDAR-based forest inventories by means of iPhone or iPad with a built-in LiDAR sensor. ForestScanner does not require any manual analysis of 3D point clouds. As the user scans trees with an iPhone/iPad, ForestScanner estimates the stem diameters and spatial coordinates based on real-time instance segmentation and circle fitting. The users can visualize, check, and share the scanning results in situ.\nC_LIO_LIBy using ForestScanner, we measured the stem diameters and spatial coordinates of 672 trees within a 1 ha plot in 1 h 39 min with an iPhone and in 1 h 38 min with an iPad (diameter [&ge;]5 cm; detection rate = 100%). The diameters measured by ForestScanner and a diameter tape were in good agreement; R2=0.963 for iPhone and R2=0.961 for iPad. ForestScanner and a conventional surveying system showed almost identical results for tree mapping (assessed by the spatial distances among trees within 0.04 ha subplots); Mantel R2=0.999 for both iPhone and iPad. ForestScanner reduced the person-hours required for measuring diameters to 25.7%, mapping trees to 9.3%, and doing both to 6.8% of the person-hours taken using a dimeter tape and the conventional surveying system.\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate that ForestScanner enables cost-, labor-, and time-efficient forest inventories. The application can increase the accessibility to LiDAR for non-experts (e.g., students, citizen scientists) and enhance resource assessments and biodiversity monitoring in forests worldwide.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Traditionally, single-copy orthologs have been the gold standard in phylogenomics. Most phylogenomic studies identify putative single-copy orthologs using clustering approaches and retain families with a single sequence per species. This limits the amount of data available by excluding larger families. Recent advances have suggested several ways to include data from larger families. For instance, tree-based decomposition methods facilitate the extraction of orthologs from large families. Additionally, several methods for species tree inference are robust to the inclusion of paralogs, and could use all of the data from larger families. Here, we explore the effects of using all families for phylogenetic inference by examining relationships among 26 primate species in detail, and by analyzing five additional datasets. We compare single-copy families, orthologs extracted using tree-based decomposition approaches, and all families with all data. We explore several species tree inference methods, finding that identical trees are returned across nearly all subsets of the data and methods for primates. The relationships among Platyrrhini remain contentious; however, the species tree inference method matters more than the subset of data used. Using data from larger gene families drastically increases the number of genes available and leads to consistent estimates of branch lengths, nodal certainty and concordance, and inferences of introgression in primates. For the other datasets, topological inferences are consistent whether single-copy families or orthologs extracted using decomposition approaches are analyzed. Using larger gene families is a promising approach to include more data in phylogenomics without sacrificing accuracy, at least when high-quality genomes are available.",

We found that the loss of FOXO1 and FOXO3 together caused impaired activation of the NK gene expression program and reduced ETS binding already at the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) level and a block at the ILC progenitor (ILCP) to NK progenitor transition. FOXO controlled NK cell maturation in organ specific manner and their ability to respond to IL-15. At the ILCP level, disruption of the ILC lineage specific gene programs was associated with broad perturbation of the generation of the non-cytotoxic ILC subsets.

The fact that only a limited fraction of a PCFP ensemble can form the photoconverted state upon near-UV light illumination, termed photoconversion efficiency (PCE), lowers the achievable spatial resolution in PALM and creates undercounting errors in quantitative counting applications. Here, we show that the PCE of mEos4b is not a fixed property of this PCFP, but strongly depends on illumination conditions. Attempts to reduce long-lived blinking in red mEos4b by application of 488 nm light leads to a reduction of the PCE. Furthermore, the PCE of mEos4b strongly depends on the applied 405-nm power density. A refined photophysical model of mEos4b accounts for the observed effects, involving nonlinear green-state photobleaching upon violet light illumination favored by photon absorption by a putative radical dark state.\n\nTOC GRAPHICS O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

We have proposed that the major lineages of {beta}-propellers arose through this mechanism and that therefore their last common ancestor was a single blade, not a fully formed {beta}-propeller. Here we show that this process of amplification and differentiation is also widespread within individual lineages, yielding {beta}-propellers with blades of more than 60% median pairwise sequence identity in most major {beta}-propeller families. In some cases, the blades are nearly identical, indicating a very recent amplification event, but even in cases where such recently amplified {beta}-propellers have more than 80% overall sequence identity to each other, comparison of their DNA sequence shows that the amplification occurred independently.",

Rhoptry proteins are key to host cell invasion and remodelling, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the thight control of rhoptry discharge are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of two novel T. gondii thrombospondin-related proteins implicated in rhoptry exocytosis. The two proteins, already annotated as MIC15 and MIC14, were renamed rhoptry discharge factor 1 (RDF1) and rhoptry discharge factor 2 (RDF2) and found to be exclusive of the Coccidia class of apicomplexan parasites. Furthermore, they were shown to have a paralogous relationship and share a C-terminal transmembrane domain followed by a short cytoplasmic tail. Immunofluorescence analysis of T. gondii tachyzoites revealed that RDF1 presents a diffuse cytoplasmic localization not reminiscent of any know subcellular compartment, whereas RDF2 was not detected. Using a conditional knockout approach, we demonstrated that RDF1 loss caused a marked growth defect. The lack of the protein did not affect parasite gliding motility, host cell attachment, replication and egress, whereas invasion was dramatically reduced. Notably, while RDF1 depletion did not result in altered microneme exocytosis, rhoptry discharge was found to be heavily impaired. Interestingly, rhoptry secretion was partially reversed by spontaneous upregulation of the RDF2 gene in knockdown parasites grown under constant RDF1 repression. Collectively, our results identify RDF1 and RDF2 as additional key players in the pathway controlling rhoptry discharge. Furthermore, this study unveils a new example of compensatory mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in T. gondii.",

Such expansions are frequent in the haematopoietic system of healthy individuals and have been termed clonal haematopoiesis (CH). While CH predisposes to myeloid neoplasia and other diseases, we have limited understanding of how and when CH develops, what factors govern its behaviour, how it interacts with ageing and how these variables relate to malignant progression. Here, we track 697 CH clones from 385 individuals aged 55 or older over a median of 13 years. We find that 92.4% of clones expanded at a stable exponential rate over the study period, with different mutations driving substantially different growth rates, ranging from 5% (DNMT3A, TP53) to over 50%/yr (SRSF2-P95H). Growth rates of clones with the same mutation differed by approximately +/-5%/yr, proportionately impacting \"slow\" drivers more substantially. By combining our time-series data with phylogenetic analysis of 1,731 whole genome-sequenced haematopoietic colonies from 7 older individuals, we reveal distinct patterns of lifelong clonal behaviour. DNMT3A-mutant clones preferentially expanded early in life and displayed slower growth in old age, in the context of an increasingly competitive oligoclonal landscape. By contrast, splicing gene mutations only drove expansion later in life, while growth of TET2-mutant clones showed minimal age-dependency. Finally, we show that mutations driving faster clonal growth carry a higher risk of malignant progression. Our findings characterise the lifelong natural history of CH and give fundamental insights into the interactions between somatic mutation, ageing and clonal selection.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Age-related change in human haematopoiesis causes reduced regenerative capacity1, cytopenias2, immune dysfunction3 and increased risk of blood cancer. The cellular alterations that underpin the abruptness of this functional decline after the age of 70 years remain elusive. We sequenced 3579 genomes from single-cell-derived colonies of haematopoietic stem cell/multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) across 10 haematologically normal subjects aged 0-81 years. HSC/MPPs accumulated 17 mutations/year after birth and lost 30bp/year of telomere length. Haematopoiesis in adults aged <65 was massively polyclonal, with high indices of clonal diversity and a stable population of 20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production. In contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged >75 showed profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each elderly subject, 30-60% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18 independent clones, each contributing 1-34% of blood production. Most clones had begun their expansion before age 40, but only 22% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide selection analysis estimated that 1/34 to 1/12 non-synonymous mutations were drivers, occurring at a constant rate throughout life, affecting a wider pool of genes than identified in blood cancers. Loss of Y chromosome conferred selective benefits on HSC/MPPs in males. Simulations from a simple model of haematopoiesis, with constant HSC population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive selection acting on many more genes than currently identified.",

Haspin remains less well studied than other M-phase kinases and the models explaining Haspin function have been developed primarily in mitotic cells. Here, we generate new mutations in the C. elegans Haspin homologs hasp-1 and hasp-2 and characterize their phenotypes. We show that hasp-1 is responsible for all predicted functions of Haspin and that loss of function of hasp-1 using classical and conditional alleles produces defects in germline stem cell proliferation, spermatogenesis, and confirms its role in oocyte meiosis. Genetic analysis suggests hasp-1 acts downstream of the Polo-like kinase plk-2 and shows synthetic interactions between hasp-1 and two genes expected to promote recruitment of the CPC by a parallel pathway that depends on the kinase Bub1. This work adds to the growing understanding of Haspin function by characterizing a variety of roles in an intact animal.\n\nSummary statementWe characterize new mutations in the C. elegans homologs of the histone kinase Haspin and show roles in spermatogenesis, germline proliferation and genetic interactions during oocyte meiosis.",

This density-dependent process is signalled by oligopeptides that stimulate the signal transduction pathway leading to stumpy formation. Using mass spectrometry analysis, peptidases released by trypanosomes were identified and, for 12 peptidases, their extracellular delivery was confirmed. Thereafter, the contribution of each peptidase to QS signal production was determined using systematic inducible overexpression in vivo, activity being confirmed to operate through the physiological QS signalling pathway. Gene knockout of the QS-active peptidases identified two enzymes, oligopeptidase B and metallocarboxypeptidase I, that significantly reduced QS when ablated individually. Further, a combinatorial gene knockout of both peptidases confirmed their dominance in the generation of the QS signal, with peptidase release of oligopeptidase B mediated via an unconventional protein secretion pathway. This identifies how the QS signal driving trypanosome virulence and transmission is generated in mammalian hosts.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472056v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@171e56dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8d7ed3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@181885forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12042e1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

Here, we measured TL in six blood cell types from 1,046 individuals using the clinically validated Flow-FISH method. We identified remarkable cell-type-specific variations in TL. Host genetics, environmental, parental and intrinsic factors such as sex, parental age, and smoking are associated to variations in TL. By analysing the genome-wide methylation patterns, we identified that the association of maternal, but not paternal, age to TL is mediated by epigenetics. Coupling these measurements to single-cell RNA-sequencing data for 62 participants revealed differential gene expression in T-cells. Genes negatively associated with TL were enriched for pathways related to translation and nonsense-mediated decay. Altogether, this study addresses cell-type-specific differences in telomere biology and its relation to cell-type-specific gene expression and highlights how perinatal factors play a role in determining TL, on top of genetics and lifestyle.",

Hebbian mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are insufficient to account for reinforced learning because neuromodulators signaling biological relevance are delayed with respect to the neural activity associated with the stimulus. A theoretical solution is the concept of eligibility traces (eTraces), silent synaptic processes elicited by activity which upon arrival of a neuromodulator are converted into a lasting change in synaptic strength. Previously we demonstrated in visual cortical slices the Hebbian induction of eTraces and their conversion into LTP and LTD by the retroactive action of norepinephrine and serotonin Here we show in vivo in V1 that the induction of eTraces and their conversion to LTP/D by norepinephrine and serotonin respectively potentiates and depresses visual responses. We also show that the integrity of this process is crucial for ocular dominance plasticity, a canonical model of experience-dependent plasticity.",

It is not a trivial task to genome-widely assign the diverse cohesin functions. Moreover, the context-specific roles of cohesin-mediated interactions, especially on intragenic regions, have not been thoroughly investigated. Here we performed a comprehensive characterization of cohesin binding sites in several human cell types. We integrated epigenomic, transcriptomic and chromatin interaction data with and without transcriptional stimulation, to explore context-specific functions of intragenic cohesin related to gene activation. We identified a new subset of cohesin binding sites, decreased intragenic cohesin sites (DICs), which have a different function from previously known ones. The intron-enriched DICs were negatively correlated with transcriptional regulation: a subgroup of DICs were related to enhancer markers and paused RNA polymerase II, whereas others contributed to chromatin architecture. We implemented machine learning and successfully isolated DICs with distinct genomic features. We observed DICs in various cell types, including cells from cohesinopathy patients. These results suggest a previously unidentified function of cohesin at intragenic regions for transcription regulation.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Protein folding under force is an integral source of generating mechanical energy in various cellular processes, ranging from protein translation to degradation. Although chaperones are well known to interact with proteins under mechanical force, how they respond to force and control cellular energetics remains unknown.\n\nTo address this question, we introduce novel real-time magnetic-tweezers technology to mimic physiological force environment on client proteins, keeping the chaperones unperturbed. We studied two structurally distinct client proteins with seven different chaperones, independently and in combination, and proposed novel mechanical activity of chaperones. We found chaperones behave differently, while these client proteins are under force than its previously known functions. For instance, tunnel associated chaperones (DsbA and trigger factor), otherwise working as holdase without force, assist folding under force. This process generates an additional mechanical energy up to [~]147 zJ to facilitate translation or translocation. However, well-known cytoplasmic foldase chaperones (PDI, thioredoxin, or DnaKJE), does not possess the mechanical folding ability under force. Notably, the transferring chaperones (DnaK, DnaJ, SecB), act as unfoldase and slow down folding process, both in the presence and absence of force, to prevent misfolding of the client proteins. This provides an emerging insight of mechanical roles of chaperones: they can generate or consume energy by shifting energy landscape of the client proteins towards folded or unfolded state; suggesting an evolutionary mechanism to minimize the energy consumption in various biological processes.",

The resulting net-like macromolecule is the essential component of bacterial cell walls that sustains the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. In Escherichia coli, bypass of PBPs by the YcbB L,D-transpeptidase leads to resistance to these drugs. We developed a new method based on heavy isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to elucidate PBP- and YcbB-mediated peptidoglycan polymerization. PBPs and YcbB similarly participated in single-strand insertion of glycan chains into the expanding bacterial side wall. This absence of any transpeptidase-specific signature suggests that the peptidoglycan expansion mode is determined by other components of polymerization complexes. YcbB did mediate {beta}-lactam resistance by insertion of multiple strands that were exclusively cross-linked to existing tripeptide-containing acceptors. We propose that this unprecedented mode of polymerization depends upon accumulation of linear glycan chains due to PBP inactivation, formation of tripeptides due to cleavage of existing cross-links by a {beta}-lactam-insensitive endopeptidase, and concerted cross-linking by YcbB.",

Further, due to the diverse signals implicated in naive T cell survival, it has been a long-held and conceptually attractive view that they are sustained by active homeostatic control as thymic activity wanes. Here we employ multiple experimental systems to identify a unified model of naive CD4 and CD8 T cell population dynamics across the mouse lifespan. We infer that both subsets divide rarely and progressively increase their survival capacity with cell age. Strikingly, this simple model captures naive CD4 T cell dynamics throughout life. In contrast, we find that newly generated naive CD8 T cells are lost more rapidly during the first 3-4 weeks of life, likely due to increased recruitment into memory. We find no evidence for elevated division rates in neonates, or for feedback regulation of naive T cell numbers at any age. We show how confronting mathematical models with diverse datasets can reveal a quantitative and remarkably simple picture of naive T cell dynamics from birth into old age.",

In this work, we propose a modification of ISM that leverages the principles of compressed sensing to require only a constant number of forward passes, regardless of sequence length, when applied to models that contain operations with a limited receptive field, such as convolutions. Our method, named Yuzu, can reduce the time that ISM spends in convolution operations by several orders of magnitude and, consequently, Yuzu can speed up ISM on several commonly used architectures in genomics by over an order of magnitude. Notably, we found that Yuzu provides speedups that increase with the complexity of the convolution operation and the length of the sequence being analyzed, suggesting that Yuzu provides large benefits in realistic settings.

Most of existing methods do not account for dependency in Hi-C data. Here, we present ZipHiC, a novel statistical method to explore Hi-C data focusing on detection of enriched contacts. ZipHiC implements a Bayesian method based on a hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model and the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to detect interactions in two-dimensional space based on Hi-C contact frequency matrix. ZipHiC uses data on the sources of biases related to contact frequency matrix, allows borrowing information from neighbours using the Potts model and improves computation speed by using the ABC model. In addition to outperforming existing tools on both simulated and real data, our model also provides insights into different sources of biases that affects Hi-C data. We show that some datasets display higher biases from DNA accessibility or Transposable Elements content. Furthermore, approximately half of the detected significant interactions connect promoters with other parts of the genome indicating a functional biological role. Finally, we found that the micro-C datasets display higher biases from DNA accessibility compared to a similar Hi-C experiment, but this can be corrected by ZipHiC.",

We investigated the CRISPR-Cas mediated biofilm regulation in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by deleting CRISPR-Cas components,{Delta} crisprI,{Delta} crisprII, {Delta}{Delta}crisprI crisprII, and{Delta} cas op. We determined that the system positively regulates surface-biofilm while inhibiting pellicle-biofilm. In knockout strains, flagellar (fliC, flgK) and curli (csgA) genes were repressed, causing reduced surface-biofilm. Conversely, they displayed altered pellicle-biofilm architecture possessing bacterial multilayers and a denser ECM with enhanced cellulose and lesser Curli, ergo weaker pellicle. The intracellular cellulose concentration was less in the knockout strains due to upregulation of bcsC, necessary for cellulose export. We hypothesized that exported cellulose integrates into the pellicle. We determined that crp is upregulated in the knockout strains, thereby inhibiting the expression of csgD, hence csgA and bcsA. The conflicting upregulation of bcsC, the last gene of bcsABZC operon, could be independently regulated by the CRISPR-Cas system owing to a partial match between the CRISPR-spacers and bcsC gene. The CRP-mediated regulation of the flagellar genes in the knockout strains was probably circumvented through the regulation of Yddx governing the availability of {sigma}28 factor that further regulates class3 flagellar genes (fliC, flgK). Additionally, the variations in the LPS profile and expression of LPS-related genes (rfaC, rfbG, rfbI) in the knockout strains could also contribute to the altered pellicle architecture. Collectively, we establish that the CRISPR-Cas system differentially regulates the formation of surface-attached and pellicle-biofilm.",

One caveat of their use is the ability of viruses to evolve resistance to antibody binding and neutralization. Computational strategies to predict which mutations will result in antibody resistance would be invaluable because current methods for identifying potential escape mutations are labor intensive and system-biased. Respiratory syncytial virus is an important pathogen for which monoclonal antibodies against the fusion (F) protein are used to prevent severe disease in high-risk infants. In this study, we used an approach that combines molecular dynamics simulations with FoldX to estimate changes in free energy in F protein folding and binding to the motavizumab antibody upon each possible amino acid change. We systematically selected 8 predicted escape mutations and tested them in an infectious clone. Consistent with our F protein stability predictions, replication-effective viruses were observed for each selected mutation. Six of the eight variants showed increased resistance to neutralization by motavizumab. Flow cytometry was used to validate the estimated (model-predicted) effects on antibody binding to F. Using surface plasmon resonance, we determined that changes in the on-rate of motavizumab binding were responsible for the reduced affinity for two novel escape mutations. Our study empirically validates the accuracy of our molecular modeling approach and emphasizes the role of biophysical protein modeling in predicting viral resistance to antibody-based therapeutics that can be used to monitor the emergence of resistant viruses and to design improved therapeutic antibodies.\n\nImportanceRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe disease in young infants, particularly those with heart or lung diseases or born prematurely. As no vaccine is currently available, monoclonal antibodies are used to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk infants. While it is known that RSV evolves to avoid recognition by antibodies, screening tools that can predict which changes to the virus will lead to antibody resistance are greatly needed.",

Models will continue to be locally rebuilt and refined using interactive tools. This inevitably results in occasional errors, among which register-shifts remain one of the most difficult to identify and correct. Here we introduce checkMySequence; a fast, fully automated and parameter-free method for detecting register-shifts in protein models built into cryo-EM maps. We show that the method can assist model building in cases where poorer map resolution hinders visual interpretation. We also show that checkMySequence could have helped avoid a widely discussed sequence register error in a model of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that was originally detected thanks to a visual residue-by-residue inspection by members of the structural biology community.\n\nSynopsisWe present a new method, checkMySequence, for fast and automated detection of register errors in protein models built into cryo-EM reconstructions.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Plastics are inexpensive and widely used organic polymers, but their high durability hinders biodegradation. Polystyrene, including extruded polystyrene also known as styrofoam, is among the most commonly produced plastics worldwide and is recalcitrant to microbial degradation. In this study, we assessed changes in the gut microbiome of superworms (Zophobas morio) reared on bran, polystyrene, or under starvation conditions over a three weeks time period. Superworms on all diets were able to complete their life cycle to pupae and imago, although superworms reared on polystyrene had minimal weight gains, resulting in lower pupation rates. The change in microbial gut communities from baseline differed considerably between diet groups, with polystyrene and starvation groups characterized by a loss of microbial diversity and the presence of opportunistic pathogens. Inferred microbial functions enriched in the polystyrene group included transposon movements, membrane restructuring, and adaptations to oxidative stress. We detected several encoded enzymes with reported polystyrene and styrene degradation abilities, supporting previous reports of polystyrene degrading bacteria in the superworm gut. By recovering metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) we linked phylogeny and functions and identified genera including Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Corynebacterium, that possess genes associated with polystyrene degradation. In conclusion, our results provide the first metagenomic insights into the metabolic pathways used by the gut microbiome of superworms to degrade polystyrene. Our results also confirm that superworms can survive on polystyrene feed, however, this diet has considerable negative impacts on host gut microbiome diversity and health.\n\nImpact StatementIncreasing plastic pollution is a major environmental problem, and a recently proposed way to counteract this trend is to embrace a circular economy, in which used materials are recycled, rather than disposed of. An important step to facilitate this process is to invent new approaches for upcycling of plastic waste to desirable consumer products. Microbial plastic degradation and conversion is likely to play a considerable part in shaping a circular economy, by engineering microbes or their enzymes to bio-upcycle plastic waste. A first step towards actualizing this goal is to identify microbes that can degrade polystyrene and to investigate the enzymes and pathways involved. Our study represents the first metagenomic analysis of an insect gut microbiome on a polystyrene diet. It identifies bacteria with polystyrene and styrene degrading abilities, and infers enzymes and pathways involved in these reactions. Therefore, our results contribute towards understanding microbial polystyrene degradation and will provide a base for future investigations into microbial upcycling of plastic waste.",

Here, we show that ant colonies, which perform computational tasks at the group level, have emergent collective sensory response thresholds. Colonies respond collectively to step changes in temperature and evacuate the nest during severe perturbations. This response is characterized by a group-size dependent threshold, and the underlying dynamics are dominated by social feedback between the ants. Using a binary network model, we demonstrate that a balance between short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory interactions can explain the emergence of the collective response threshold and its size dependency. Our findings illustrate how simple social dynamics allow insect colonies to integrate information about the external environment and their internal state to produce adaptive collective responses.",

Using family data that spans two generations, combining registry, survey, and genotype information, this study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). We show that there are no genetic differences by birth order as captured by polygenic scores (PGSs) for educational attainment. Furthermore, we show that earlier-born have lower birth weight than later-born, indicating worse uterine environments. Educational outcomes are still higher for earlier-born children when we adjust for PGSs and in utero variables, indicating that birth order differences arise post-natally. Finally, we consider potential environmental influences, such as differences according to maternal age, parental educational attainment, and sibling genetic nurture. We show that birth order differences are not biological in origin, but pinning down their specific causes remains elusive.",

While the repeats themselves were far from sequence perfect they had notable conservation to a statistically significant level with three or more repetitions identified within one protein at a level that would be expected to randomly occur only once per 1031 residues. This sequence repeat was associated with a six stranded antiparallel {beta}-barrel module, two of which are present in the core of the structures of the PA clan of serine proteases, while a modified version of this module could be identified in the PDZ-like domains. Automated structural alignment methods had difficulties in superimposing these {beta}-barrels but use of a target human HtrA2 structure showed that these modules had an average RMSD across the set of structures of less than 2 [A] (mean and median).

Chitinase 1 (CHIT1), an 18 glycosyl hydrolase family member, contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis through regulation of Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-{beta} signaling and effector function. Therefore, CHIT1 is a potential therapeutic target of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nObjectivesThis study aimed to identify and characterize a druggable CHIT1 inhibitor with strong antifibrotic activity and minimal toxicity for therapeutic application to pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nMethodsExtensive screening of small molecule libraries identified the aminoglycoside antibiotic Kasugamycin as a potent CHIT1 inhibitor.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsElevated levels of CHIT1 were detected in the lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. In vivo bleomycin- and TGF-{beta}-stimulated murine models of pulmonary fibrosis, Kasugamycin showed impressive anti-fibrotic effects in both preventive and therapeutic conditions. In vitro studies also demonstrated that Kasugamycin inhibits fibrotic macrophage activation, fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast transformation. Null mutation of transforming growth factor beta associated protein 1 (TGFBRAP1), a recently identified CHIT1 interacting signaling molecule, phenocopied antifibrotic effects of Kasugamycin in in vivo lungs and in vitro fibroblasts responses. Kasugamycin inhibits physical association between CHIT1 and TGFBRAP1, suggesting that antifibrotic effect of Kasugamycin is mediated through regulation of TGFBRAP1, at least in part.\n\nConclusionsThese studies demonstrate that Kasugamycin is a novel CHIT1 inhibitor with strong antifibrotic effect that can be further developed as an effective and safe therapeutic drug for pulmonary fibrosis.",

In most genes, including KCNH2, the majority of missense variants are currently classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). The aim of this study is to investigate the utility of an automated patch-clamp assay for aiding clinical variant classification in the KCNH2 gene.\n\nMethodsThe assay was designed according to recommendations of the ClinGen sequence variant interpretation framework. Thirty-one control variants of known clinical significance (17 pathogenic/likely pathogenic, 14 benign/likely benign) were heterozygously expressed in Flp-In HEK293 cells. Variants were analysed for effects on current density and channel gating. A panel of 44 VUS was then assessed for reclassification.\n\nResultsAll 17 pathogenic variant controls had reduced current density and 13/14 benign variant controls had normal current density, which enabled determination of normal and abnormal ranges for applying moderate or supporting evidence strength for variant classification. Inclusion of KCNH2 functional assay evidence enabled us to reclassify 6 out of 44 VUS as likely pathogenic.\n\nConclusionThe high-throughput patch clamp assay can provide moderate strength evidence for clinical interpretation of clinical KCNH2 variants and demonstrates the value proposition for developing automated patch clamp assays for other ion channel genes.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The majority of the pyruvate inside plant mitochondria is either transported into the matrix from the cytosol via the mitochondria pyruvate carrier (MPC) or synthesised in the matrix by alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) or NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME). Pyruvate from these origins could mix into a single pool in the matrix and contribute indistinguishably to respiration, or they could maintain a degree of independence in metabolic regulation. Here, we demonstrated that feeding isolated mitochondria with U-13C-pyruvate and unlabelled malate enables the assessment of pyruvate contribution from different sources to TCA cycle intermediate production. Imported pyruvate is the preferred source for citrate production even when the synthesis of NAD-ME-derived pyruvate was optimised. Genetic or pharmacological elimination of MPC activity removed this preference and allowed an equivalent amount of citrate to be generated from the pyruvate produced by NAD-ME. Increasing mitochondrial pyruvate pool size by exogenous addition only affected metabolites from pyruvate transported by MPC whereas depleting pyruvate pool size by transamination to alanine only affected metabolic products derived from NAD-ME. Together, these data reveal respiratory substrate supply in plants involves distinct pyruvate pools inside the matrix that can be flexibly mixed based on the rate of pyruvate transport from the cytosol. These pools are independently regulated and contribute differentially to organic acids export from plant mitochondria.\n\nSignificance statementPyruvate is the primary respiratory substrate for energy production to support plant growth and development. However, it is also the starting material of many other pathways. Prioritisation of respiratory use over other competing pathways would enable a level of control when pyruvate is delivered to mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter. We demonstrated the existence of two distinct pyruvate pools in plant mitochondria suggesting inner mitochondrial organisation allows metabolic heterogeneity, hence metabolic specialisation. This explains why NAD-ME flux into plant respiration is low and confirms the prominent link between imported pyruvate and energy production. This compartmentation also reveals how NAD-ME supplies substrate to the mitochondrial pyruvate exporter in plants, especially during C4 metabolism.",

Despite this fundamental role in eukaryotic cell biology, we lack a phylogenetically-comprehensive understanding of chromatin evolution. Here, we combine comparative proteomics and genomics analysis of chromatin in eukaryotes and archaea. Proteomics uncovers the existence of histone post-translational modifications in Archaea. However, archaeal histone modifications are scarce, in contrast with the highly conserved and abundant marks we identify across eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that chromatin-associated catalytic functions (e.g., methyltransferases) have pre-eukaryotic origins, whereas histone mark readers and chaperones are eukaryotic innovations. We show that further chromatin evolution is characterized by expansion of readers, including capture by transposable elements and viruses. Overall, our study infers detailed evolutionary history of eukaryotic chromatin: from its archaeal roots, through the emergence of nucleosome-based regulation in the eukaryotic ancestor, to the diversification of chromatin regulators and their hijacking by genomic parasites.",

Here, we provide new insights into this regions demographic history based on genome-wide data from 16 ancient individuals (2600-250 yrs BP) from islands of the North Moluccas, Sulawesi, and East Nusa Tenggara. While the ancestry of individuals from the northern islands fit earlier views of contact between groups related to the Austronesian expansion and the first colonization of Sahul, the ancestry of individuals from the southern islands revealed additional contributions from Mainland Southeast Asia, which seems to predate the Austronesian admixture in the region. Admixture time estimates for the oldest individuals of Wallacea are closer to archaeological estimates for the Austronesian arrival into the region than are admixture time estimates for present-day groups. The decreasing trend in admixture times exhibited by younger individuals supports a scenario of multiple or continuous admixture involving Papuan- and Asian-related groups. Our results clarify previously debated times of admixture and suggest that the Neolithic dispersals into Island Southeast Asia are associated with the spread of multiple genetic ancestries.",

When parent-offspring data are available for inferring true phase from Mendelian inheritance rules, the accuracy of statistical phasing is usually measured by the switch error rate, which is the proportion of pairs of consecutive heterozygotes that are incorrectly phased. We present a method for estimating the genotype error rate from parent-offspring trios and a method for estimating the bias in the observed switch error rate that is caused by genotype error. We apply these methods to 485,301 genotyped UK Biobank samples that include 899 White British trios and to 38,387 sequenced TOPMed samples that include 217 African Caribbean trios and 669 European American trios. We show that genotype error inflates the observed switch error rate and that the relative bias increases with sample size. For the UK Biobank White British trios, we estimate that the observed switch error rate in the trio offspring is 2.4 times larger than the true switch error rate (1.41 x 10-3 vs 5.79 x 10-4) and that the average distance between phase errors is 64 megabases.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Organismal growth and development rely on RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) synthesizing the appropriate repertoire of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from protein-coding genes. Productive elongation of full-length transcripts is essential for mRNA function, however what determines whether an engaged RNAPII molecule will terminate prematurely or transcribe processively remains poorly understood. Notably, despite a common process for transcription initiation across RNAPII-synthesized RNAs1, RNAPII is highly susceptible to termination when transcribing non-coding RNAs such as upstream antisense RNAs (uaRNAs) and enhancers RNAs (eRNAs)2, suggesting that differences arise during RNAPII elongation. To investigate the impact of transcribed sequence on elongation potential, we developed a method to screen the effects of thousands of INtegrated Sequences on Expression of RNA and Translation using high-throughput sequencing (INSERT-seq). We found that higher AT content in uaRNAs and eRNAs, rather than specific sequence motifs, underlies the propensity for RNAPII termination on these transcripts. Further, we demonstrate that 5 splice sites exert both splicing-dependent and autonomous, splicing-independent stimulation of transcription, even in the absence of polyadenylation signals. Together, our results reveal a potent role for transcribed sequence in dictating gene output at mRNA and non-coding RNA loci, and demonstrate the power of INSERT-seq towards illuminating these contributions.",

Mutations in four sHSPs (HspB1, HspB3, HspB5, HspB8) are associated with neuromuscular disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolutionary forces shaping these sHSPs during vertebrate evolution. We performed comparative evolutionary analyses on a set of orthologous sHSP sequences, based on the ratio of non-synonymous: synonymous substitution rates for each codon. We found that these sHSPs had been historically exposed to different degrees of purifying selection, decreasing in this order: HspB8 > HspB1, HspB5 > HspB3. Within each sHSP, regions with different degrees of purifying selection can be discerned, resulting in characteristic selective pressure profiles. The conserved -crystallin domains were exposed to the most stringent purifying selection compared to the flanking regions, supporting a  dimorphic pattern of evolution. Thus, during vertebrate evolution the different sequence partitions were exposed to different and measurable degrees of selective pressures. Among the disease-associated mutations, most are missense mutations primarily in HspB1 and to a minor extent in the other sHSPs. Our data provide an explanation for this disparate incidence. Contrary to the expectation, most missense mutations cause dominant disease phenotypes. Theoretical considerations support a connection between the historic exposure of these sHSP genes to a high degree of purifying selection and the unusual prevalence of genetic dominance of the associated disease phenotypes. Our study puts the genetics of inheritable sHSP-borne diseases into the context of vertebrate evolution.",

Using Sendai virus to model natural infection in mice, we combine 3D imaging, lineage-tracing, and single-cell genomics to show that AT1 cells have an intermediary role by persisting in areas depleted of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, mounting an interferon response, and receding from invading airway cells. Sendai virus infection mobilizes airway cells to form alveolar SOX2+ clusters without differentiating into AT1 or AT2 cells, as shown in influenza models. Intriguingly, large AT2-cell-depleted areas remain covered by AT1 cells, which we name \"AT2-less regions\", and are replaced by SOX2+ clusters spreading both basally and luminally around AT1 cell extensions. AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation are largely confined to topologically distal regions - the end of airspace that could be in the periphery or middle of the lung - and form de novo alveolar surface, with limited contribution to in situ repair of AT2-less regions. Time course single-cell RNA-seq and AT1-cell interactome analyses suggest enhanced recognition of AT1 cells by immune cells and altered growth signals. Our comprehensive spatiotemporal and genome-wide study highlights the hitherto unappreciated role of AT1 cells during Sendai virus infection and possibly other injury-repair processes.",

Adaptive modulation of HCN1 has been observed as has pathogenic dysregulation. While the mechanisms underlying this modulation remain incompletely understood, regulation of HCN1 has been shown to include phosphorylation. A candidate phosphorylation-dependent regulator of HCN1 channels is 14-3-3. We used bioinformatics to identify three potential 14-3-3 binding sites in HCN1. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that recombinant 14-3-3 binds all three phospho-peptides with low micromolar affinity. We confirmed that 14-3-3 could pull down HCN1 from multiple tissue sources and used HEK293 cells to detail the interaction. Two binding sites in the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of HCN1 were necessary and sufficient for a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3. The same region of HCN1 containing the 14-3-3 binding sites is required for phosphorylation-independent protein degradation. We propose a model in which phosphorylation of S810 and S867 (human S789 and S846) recruits 14-3-3 to inhibit a yet unidentified factor signaling for protein degradation, thus increasing the half-life of HCN1.",

Many statistical methods have been used for analyzing neural activity, but estimating the direction of network interactions correctly and efficiently remains a difficult problem (1). Here, we derive dynamical differential covariance (DDC), a new method based on dynamical network models that detects directional interactions with low bias and high noise tolerance under nonstationarity conditions. The method was first validated and compared with other methods on networks with false positive motifs and multiscale neural simulations where the ground truth connectivity was known. When applied to recordings of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) recordings, DDC consistently detected regional interactions with strong structural connectivity in over 1,000 individual subjects obtained by diffusion MRI (dMRI). DDC is a promising new family of methods for estimating functional connectivity that can be generalized to a wide range of dynamical models and recording techniques and to other applications where system identification from sparse data is needed.\n\nSignificance StatementThrough dynamical interactions with each other, neurons make it possible for us to sense, move and think. It is now possible to simultaneously record from many individual neurons and brain regions. Methods for analyzing these large-scale recordings are needed that can reveal how the patterns of activity give rise to behavior. We developed an efficient, intuitive and robust way to analyze these recordings and validated it on simulations of model neural networks where the ground truth was known. We called this method dynamical differential covariance (DDC) because it can estimate not only the presence of a connection but also which direction the information is flowing in a network between neurons or cortical areas. We also successfully applied DDC to brain imaging data from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",

The LCM assumes that lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filter out orthographic strings without meaning. The LCM successfully simulates benchmark results from functional brain imaging. Empirically, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that quantitative LCM simulations predict lvOT activation across three studies better than alternative models. Besides, we found that word-likeness, which is assumed as input to LCM, is represented posterior to lvOT. In contrast, a dichotomous word/non-word contrast, which is assumed as the LCMs output, could be localized to upstream frontal brain regions. Finally, we found that training lexical categorization results in more efficient reading. Thus, we propose a ventral-visual-stream processing framework for reading involving word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization, before meaning extraction.",

Consequently, incorporating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study, we compared counterconditioning (a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction, at recent (24 hours) and remote ([~]1 month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, counterconditioning diminished 24-hour relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One-month later, the retrieval of both standard- and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-hour and 1-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may generate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.\n\nSignificance StatementPrevalent treatments for pathological fear and anxiety are based on the principles of Pavlovian extinction. Unfortunately, extinction forms weak memories that only temporarily inhibit the retrieval of threat associations. Thus, to increase the translational relevance of extinction research, it is critical to investigate whether extinction can be augmented to form a more enduring memory, especially after long intervals. Here, we used a multi-day fMRI paradigm in humans to compare the short- and long-term neurobehavioral effects of aversive-to-appetitive counterconditioning, a form of augmented extinction. Our results provide novel evidence that including an appetitive stimulus during extinction can reduce short-term threat relapse and stabilize the memory trace of extinction in the vmPFC, for at least one month after learning.",

Industrialized infants, even those who are breastfed, have microbiomes characterized by a paucity of Bifidobacterium infantis and gene cassettes involved in human milk utilization. Strains within lifestyle-associated taxonomic groups are shared between mother-infant dyads, consistent with early-life inheritance of lifestyle-shaped microbiomes.

Our results complete the structural characterization of the NPC symmetric core, providing a rich foundation for future functional studies.\n\nOne sentence summaryAn interdisciplinary analysis established the near-atomic molecular architecture and evolutionary conservation of the linker-scaffold of the human nuclear pore complex.",

    "preprint_abstract": "The search for an  ideal approach to investigate the functional connections in the human brain is an ongoing challenge for the neuroscience community. While resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to study individual functional connectivity patterns, recent work has highlighted the benefits of collecting functional connectivity data while participants are exposed to naturalistic stimuli, such as watching a movie or listening to a story. For example, functional connectivity data collected during movie-watching were shown to predict cognitive and emotional scores more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We have previously reported a tight link between resting-state functional connectivity and task-derived neural activity, such that the former successfully predicts the latter. In the current work we use data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that naturalistic-stimulus-derived functional connectivity predicts task-induced brain activation maps more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We then show that activation maps predicted using naturalistic stimuli are better predictors of individual intelligence scores than activation maps predicted using resting-state. We additionally examine the influence of naturalistic-stimulus type on prediction accuracy. Our findings emphasize the potential of naturalistic stimuli as a promising alternative to resting-state fMRI for connectome-based predictive modelling of individual brain activity and cognitive traits.",

According to one theoretical account, these differences hinge on whether the memories contain information about both an item itself as well as associated details (remember) versus those that are devoid of these associated contextual details (familiar). This distinction has been supported by computational modeling of behavior, studies in patients, and neuroimaging work including differences both in electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging. At present, however, little evidence has emerged to suggest that neurophysiological measures track individual differences in estimates of recollection and familiarity. Here, we conducted electrophysiological recordings of brain activity during a recognition memory task designed to differentiate between behavioral indices of recollection and familiarity. Non-parametric cluster-based permutation analyses revealed associations between electrophysiological signatures of familiarity and recollection with their respective behavioral estimates. These results support the idea that recollection and familiarity are distinct phenomena and is the first, to our knowledge, to identify distinct electrophysiological signatures that track individual differences in these processes.",

However, it is unclear whether the discounted value of the large reward option is the main contributor to variability in animals choices in either task, which may limit translatability to human discounting data. Male and female mice underwent sessions of delay and probability discounting in sequence to assess how choice behavior adapts over experience with each task. To control for \"anchoring\" (persistent choices based on the initial delay or probability), mice experienced \"Worsening\" schedules where the large reward was offered under initially favorable delay or probability conditions that became less favorable during testing, followed by \"Improving\" schedules where the large reward was offered under initially unfavorable conditions that improved over a session. During delay discounting, both male and female mice showed elimination of anchoring effects over training. In probability discounting, both sexes of mice continued to show some anchoring even after months of training. One possibility is that noisy action selection could contribute to these anchoring effects, rather than persistent fluctuations in value discounting. We fit choice behavior in individual animals using models that included both a value-based discounting parameter and a decision noise parameter that captured variability in choices deviating from value maximization. Changes in anchoring behavior over time were tracked by changes in our decision noise parameter, not the value parameter. Thus, changes in discounting behavior in mice can result from changes in exploration of the environment rather than changes in reward valuation.",

It remains unknown if the action of an ASD upon inhibitory neurons could counteract its beneficial effects on excitatory neurons (or vice versa), thereby reducing the efficacy of the ASD. Here, we examine whether the efficacy of the ASD retigabine (RTG) is altered after removal of the Kv7 potassium channel subunit KCNQ2, one of its drug targets, from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs). Parvalbumin-Cre (PV-Cre) mice were crossed with Kcnq2-floxed (Kcnq2fl/fl) mice to conditionally delete Kcnq2 from PV-INs. In these conditional knockout mice (cKO, PV-Kcnq2fl/fl), RTG (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly delayed the onset of either picrotoxin (PTX, 10 mg/kg, i.p)- or kainic acid (KA, 30mg/kg, i.p.)-induced convulsive seizures compared to vehicle, while RTG was not effective in wild-type littermates (WT). Immunostaining for KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 revealed that both subunits were enriched at axon initial segments (AISs) of hippocampal CA1 PV-INs, and their specific expression was selectively abolished in cKO mice. Accordingly, the M-currents recorded from CA1 PV-INs and their sensitivity to RTG were significantly reduced in cKO mice. While the ability of RTG to suppress CA1 excitatory neurons in hippocampal slices was unchanged in cKO mice, its suppressive effect on the spike activity of CA1 PV-INs was significantly reduced compared with WT mice. In addition, the RTG-induced suppression on intrinsic membrane excitability of PV-INs in WT mice was significantly reduced in cKO mice. These findings suggest that preventing RTG from suppressing PV-INs improves its anticonvulsant effect.\n\nSignificance StatementOne out of three patients with epilepsy remain resistant to anti-seizure drugs (ASD). Therefore, strategies that can enhance the efficacy of current ASDs or aid in the development of novel ASDs are in high demand. Here we show that by sparing a subset of inhibitory neurons, the ASD retigabine becomes more efficacious. These findings indicate that developing the ASDs that have relatively greater effects on excitatory over inhibitory neurons may be an effective strategy to improve the efficacy of ASDs.",

Forming cytoophidia appears to be a highly conserved and ancient property of CTPS. To our surprise, here we find that polar cells and stalk cells, two specialized types of cells composing Drosophila interfollicular stalks, do not possess obvious cytoophidia. Moreover, we show that Myc level is low in these two types of cells, supporting the idea that Myc regulates cytoophidium assembly. Treatment with a glutamine analog, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), increases cytoophidium assembly in main follicle cells, but not in polar cells or stalk cells. Our findings provide an interesting paradigm for the in vivo study of cytoophidium assembly and disassembly among different populations of follicle cells.",

Fatigue had a significant effect (p [&le;] 0.05) on all dependent variables. Other than for the maximal voluntary contraction torque, where males showed a greater fatigue-related decrease than females, males and females showed generally similar changes with fatigue.

Yet, it is unclear how to define or distinguish different brain states. A potential source of brain state variation is arousal, which may play a role in modulating functional interactions between brain regions. Here, we use simultaneous resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and pupillometry to study the impact of arousal levels indexed by pupil area on the integration of large-scale brain networks. We employ a novel sparse dictionary learning-based method to identify hub regions participating in between-network integration stratified by arousal, by measuring k-hubness, the number (k) of functionally overlapping networks in each brain region. We show evidence of a brain-wide decrease in between-network integration and inter-subject variability at low relative to high arousal, with differences emerging across regions of the frontoparietal, default mode, motor, limbic, and cerebellum networks. State-dependent changes in k-hubness relate to the actual patterns of network integration within these hubs, suggesting a brain state transition from high to low arousal characterized by global synchronization and reduced network overlaps. We demonstrate that arousal is not limited to specific brain areas known to be directly associated with arousal regulation, but instead has a brain-wide impact that involves high-level between-network communications.",

Including both female and male mice in our associative learning experiments shed light on sex differences on the impact of chronic implantation of tetrodes on learning. While previous research showed intact female mice acquired trace eyeblink conditioning faster than male and ovariectomized females, implantation of chronic microdrive arrays showed sexually dimorphic effects on learning. Microdrive implanted male mice acquired the associative learning paradigm faster than both intact and ovariectomized females. These effects were not due to the weight of the drive alone, as there were no significant sex-differences in learning of animals that received \"dummy drive\" implants without tetrodes lowered into the brain.

Compared to other processes such as protein folding, however, the dynamical evolution of allosteric transitions is still not well understood. As example of allosteric coupling between distant protein regions, we consider the global open-closed motion of the two domains of T4 lysozyme, which is triggered by local motion in the hinge region. Combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations with a correlation analysis of interresidue contacts, we identify a network of interresidue distances that move in a concerted manner. The cooperative process originates from a cogwheel-like motion of the hydrophobic core in the hinge region, which constitutes a flexible transmission network. Through rigid contacts and the protein backbone, the small local changes of the hydrophobic core are passed on to the distant terminal domains and lead to the emergence of a rare global conformational transition. As in an Ising-type model, the cooperativity of the allosteric transition can be explained via the interaction of local fluctuations.",

Stomata have long been believed as a part of C4 syndrome. However, it remains unclear how stomata traits evolved along the path from C3 to C4. Stomatal patterning was examined in Flaveria genus, a model for studying C4 evolution. Comparative, transgenic and semi-in-vitro experiments were used to study molecular basis that underlies stomatal traits along C4 evolution. Novel results: the evolution from C3 to C4 species through intermediate species is accompanied by a stepwise rather than an abrupt change in the stomatal traits. The initial change occurs near Type II and dramatic change occurs at the C4-like species. On the road to C4, stomata become less in number but bigger in size and changes in stomatal density dominates changes in maximum stomatal conductance (gsmax). The reduction of FSTOMAGEN expression underlies altered gsmax between Flaveria species with different photosynthetic pathways and likely occurs in other C4 lineages. Our study provides insight into the pattern, mechanism and role of stomatal evolution along the road towards C4.

    "preprint_abstract": "Phylogenetic analyses fail to yield a satisfactory resolution of some relationships in the tree of life even with genome-scale datasets, so the failure is unlikely to reflect limitations in the amount of data. Gene tree conflicts are particularly notable in studies focused on these contentious nodes, and taxon sampling, different analytical methods, and/or data type effects can further confound analyses. Although many efforts have been made to incorporate biological conflicts, few studies have curated individual genes for their efficiency in phylogenomic studies. Here, we conduct an edge-based analysis of Neoavian evolution, examining the phylogenetic efficacy of two recent phylogenomic bird datasets and three datatypes (ultraconserved elements [UCEs], introns, and coding regions). We assess the potential causes for biases in signal-resolution for three difficult nodes: the earliest divergence of Neoaves, the position of the enigmatic Hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin), and the position of owls (Strigiformes). We observed extensive conflict among genes for all data types and datasets even after meticulous curation. Edge-based analyses (EBA) increased congruence and provided information about the impact of data type, GC content variation (GCCV), and outlier genes on each of nodes we examined. First, outlier gene signals appeared to drive different patterns of support for the relationships among the earliest diverging Neoaves. Second, the placement of Hoatzin was highly variable, although our EBA did reveal a previously unappreciated data type effect with an impact on its position. It also revealed that the resolution with the most support here was Hoatzin + shorebirds. Finally, GCCV, rather than data type (i.e., coding vs non-coding)per se, was correlated with a signal that supports monophyly of owls + Accipitriformes (hawks, eagles, and New World vultures). Eliminating high GCCV loci increased the signal for owls + mousebirds. Categorical EBA was able to reveal the nature of each edge and provide a way to highlight especially problematic branches that warrant a further examination. The current study increases our understanding about the contentious parts of the avian tree, which show even greater conflicts than appreciated previously.",

    "preprint_abstract": "RNA viruses are critically dependent upon virally encoded proteases that cleave the viral polyproteins into functional mature proteins. Many of these proteases are structurally conserved with an essential catalytic cysteine and this offers the opportunity to irreversibly inhibit these enzymes with electrophilic small molecules. Here we describe the successful application of quantitative irreversible tethering (qIT) to identify acrylamide fragments that selectively target the active site cysteine of the 3C protease (3Cpro) of Enterovirus 71, the causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease in humans, altering the substrate binding region. Further, we effectively re-purpose these hits towards the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 which shares the 3C-like fold as well as similar catalytic-triad. We demonstrate that the hit fragments covalently link to the catalytic cysteine of Mpro to inhibit its activity. In addition, we provide the first demonstration that targeting the active site cysteine of Mpro can also have profound allosteric effects, distorting secondary structures required for formation of the active dimeric unit of Mpro. These new data provide novel mechanistic insights into the design of EV71 3Cpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and identify acrylamide-tagged pharmacophores for elaboration into more selective agents of therapeutic potential.",

    "preprint_abstract": "High throughput genomics has greatly facilitated identification of genetic variants. However, determining which variants contribute to disease causation is challenging with more than half of all missense variants now classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). A VUS leaves patients and their clinicians unable to utilize the variant information in clinical decision-making. In long QT syndrome type 2, KCNH2 channel function is directly associated with disease presentation. Therefore, functional phenotyping of KCNH2 variants can provide direct evidence to aid variant classification. Here, we investigated the expression of all codon variants in exon 2 of KCNH2 using a massively parallel trafficking assay and for a subset of 458 single nucleotide variants compared the results with peak tail current density and gating using automated patch clamp electrophysiology. Trafficking could correctly classify loss of peak tail current density variants with an AUC reaching 0.94 compared to AUCs of 0.75 to 0.8 for in silico variant classifiers. We suggest massively parallel trafficking assays can provide prospective and accurate functional assessment for all missense variants in KCNH2 and most likely many other ion channels and membrane proteins.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Post-divergence gene flow can trigger a number of creative evolutionary outcomes, ranging from the transfer of beneficial alleles across species boundaries (i.e., adaptive introgression) to the formation of new species (i.e., hybrid speciation). While neutral and adaptive introgression has been broadly documented in nature, hybrid speciation is assumed to be rare and the evolutionary and ecological context facilitating this phenomenon still remains controversial. Through combining genomic and phenotypic data, we evaluate the hypothesis that the dual feeding regime (scrub legumes and gramineous herbs) of the taxonomically controversial grasshopper Chorthippus saulcyi algoaldensis resulted from hybridization between two sister taxa that exhibit contrasting host-plant specializations: C. binotatus (scrub legumes) and C. saulcyi (gramineous herbs). Genetic clustering analyses and inferences from coalescent-based demographic simulations confirmed that C. s. algoaldensis represents a uniquely evolving lineage and supported the ancient hybrid origin of this taxon (ca. 1.4 Ma), which provides a mechanistic explanation for its broader trophic niche and sheds light on its uncertain phylogenetic position. We propose a Pleistocene hybrid speciation model where range shifts resulting from climatic oscillations can promote the formation of hybrid swarms and facilitate its long-term persistence through geographic isolation from parental forms in topographically complex landscapes.",

In this study we assessed the efficiency of long-read high throughput sequencing (HTS) as opposed to the traditionally used Sanger method for taxonomic identification of multiple vouchered fungal specimens, and providing reference information about intra-individual allele polymorphism. We developed a workflow based on a test-set of 423 fungal specimens (representing 205 species), PacBio HTS method, and ribosomal rRNA operon internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA gene (LSU) markers. PacBio HTS had a higher success rate than Sanger sequencing at a comparable cost. Species identification based on PacBio reads was usually straightforward, because the dominant operational taxonomic unit (OTU) typically represented the targeted organism. Unlike the Sanger method, PacBio HTS enabled detecting widespread allele polymorphism within the ITS marker in the studied specimens. We conclude that multiplex DNA barcoding of the fungal ITS and LSU markers using a PacBio HTS is a useful tool for taxonomic identification of large amounts of collected voucher specimens at competitive price. Furthermore, PacBio HTS accurately recovers various alleles, which can provide crucial information for species delimitation and population-level studies.",

Here, we develop a microfluidic-based method to track the outcome of T cell activity on many individual cancer spheroids simultaneously, with a high spatiotemporal resolution. By combining these parallel measurements of T cell behaviors and tumor fate with probabilistic modeling, we establish that the first recruited T cells initiate a positive feedback loop leading to an accelerated effector accumulation on the spheroid. We also provide evidence that cooperation between T cells on the spheroid during the killing phase facilitates tumor destruction. We propose that tumor destruction does not simply reflect the sum of individual T cell activities but relies instead on collective behaviors promoting both T cell accumulation and function. The possibility to track many replicates of immune-tumor interactions with such a level of detail should help delineate the mechanisms and efficacy of various immunotherapeutic strategies.",

However, once inactivated, their reactivation remains difficult, especially in diploid cells. Here, we present DExCon (Doxycycline-mediated endogenous gene Expression Control), DExogron (DExCon combined with auxin-mediated targeted protein degradation) and LUXon (light responsive DExCon), approaches which combine one-step CRISPR-Cas9 mediated targeted knock-in of fluorescent proteins with an advanced Tet-inducible TRE3GS promoter. These approaches combine blockade of active gene transcription with the ability to reactivate transcription on demand, including activation of silenced genes. Systematic control can be exerted using doxycycline or spatiotemporally by light, and we demonstrate functional knockout/rescue in the closely related Rab11 family of vesicle trafficking regulators. Fluorescent protein knock-in results in bright signals compatible with low-light live microscopy from monoallelic modification, the potential to simultaneously image different alleles of the same gene and bypasses the need to work with clones. Protein levels are easily tunable to correspond with endogenous expression through cell sorting (DExCon), timing of light illumination (LUXon) or by exposing cells to different levels of auxin (DExogron). Furthermore, our approach allowed us to quantify previously unforeseen differences in vesicle dynamics, expression kinetics and protein stability among highly similar endogenous Rab11 family members and their colocalization in triple knock-in cells.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nIN BRIEFWe describe development of DExCon, LUXon and DExogron approaches, where a single CRIPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing event can block endogenous gene expression, with the ability to reactivate expression encoded such that even silent genes can be expressed.

Previously, our group developed a transparent human platelet lysate (hPL)-based biomaterial that showed good cell compatibility and accelerated corneal epithelial cells healing in-vitro. This study aims to develop a novel treatment method for corneal perforation using this biomaterial.\n\nMethodsRheometry was used to measure the hPL-based biomaterial behaviour at room and corneal surface temperatures. Its adhesiveness to porcine skin and burst pressure limit were also measured. Based on rheological behaviour, a hand-held biopen was developed to extrude it onto the cornea. An animal trial (5 New Zealand white rabbits) to compare impact of the biomaterial and cyanoacrylate glue (control group) on a 2mm perforation was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy.\n\nResultsThe hPL-based biomaterial showed higher adhesiveness compared to commercial fibrin glue and withstood burst pressure approximately 6.4x higher than routine intraocular pressure. Treatment rabbits had lower pain scores and faster recovery, despite generating similar scar-forming structure compared to controls. No secondary corneal ulcer was generated in rabbits treated with the bio-adhesive.\n\nConclusionsThis study reports a novel in-situ printing system capable of delivering a hPL-based, transparent bio-adhesive and successfully treating small corneal perforations. Bio-adhesive-treated rabbits recovered faster and required no additional analgesia. Both groups showed scarred corneal tissue after healing, however no infection and inflammation was observed by 3 weeks. The delivery system was easy to use and may represent an alternative treatment for corneal perforation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThis study presents a novel in situ printing system to treat corneal perforation\nC_LIO_LIThe system is comprised of a human platelet lysate-based bio-adhesive and a pen-like hand held delivery system\nC_LIO_LIMechanical tests showed our transparent bio-adhesive has a higher adhesiveness compared to existing treatments and burst pressure threshold approximately 6.4 times higher than normal intraocular pressure.\nC_LIO_LIIn vivo rabbit trial showed that compared to cyanoacrylate glue, the bio-adhesive was safer, faster healing and led to less pain in rabbits.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Colour cues play an important role in sexual selection and conspecific recognition. Literature shows that conspecifics might enjoy their everyday chat, without ever worrying about occasional eavesdroppers (e.g., predators), when information interchange evolves into a private communication channel. Yet, when signalling is converted into foraging cues by predators, their prey must pay the due cost for sustaining conversation. For that matter, fiddler crabs draw attention for having flashy enlarged claws that could potentially attract the attention of many predators. Surprisingly, the costs associated with claw colouration in fiddler crabs are still poorly understood and have never been studied in American species. Here, we initially examine whether hypertrophied claws of American thin-fingered fiddler crabs (Leptuca leptodactyla) reflect UV-light and how conspecific females react to these cues. Then we test two alternative hypotheses concerning the role of claw colouration in fiddler crabs mate choice: a) that claw colouration evolved into a private communication channel, which could have significantly lowered signalling costs for males; b) that claw colouration is conspicuous to potential reproductive partners, as well as to predators, making colour signalling by males very costly (i.e., a handicap). Thereafter, we measured the reflectance spectra from several enlarged claws and modelled their chromatic contrast against the background spectrum, considering the visual systems of conspecific fiddler crabs and two kinds of predators (terns and plovers). We also tested female conspecifics preference towards enlarged claws that reflected UV-light or other colour cues, by artificially altering claw colouration. Our results show a clear female preference for UV reflecting males. We also found that natural enlarged claws should be highly detectable by avian predators, refuting the private communication channel hypothesis. Furthermore, since female fiddler crabs select the most flamboyant claws from the sandy background, claw colouration in fiddler crabs can be understood as an honest signal.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe hypertrophied claws of male Leptuca leptodactyla reflect UV light.\nC_LIO_LIFemale fiddler crabs display a natural preference for UV light cues.\nC_LIO_LIConspicuous claws function as handicaps and may honestly signal individual quality.\nC_LIO_LIMale enlarged claws are more conspicuous to birds than to crabs.\nC_LIO_LIOur data refute the presence of a private communication channel in L. leptodactyla.\nC_LI",

    "preprint_abstract": "Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 (R. palustris) is a gram negative purple non-sulfur bacteria that grows phototrophically or chemotrophically by fixing or catabolizing a wide array of substrates including lignin breakdown products (e.g., p-coumarate) for its carbon and nitrogen requirements. It can grow aerobically or anaerobically and can use light, inorganic, and organic compounds for energy production. Due to its ability to convert different carbon sources into useful products in anaerobic mode, this study, for the first time, reconstructed a metabolic and expression (ME-) model of R. palustris to investigate its anaerobic-photoheterotrophic growth. Unlike metabolic (M-) models, ME-models include transcription and translation reactions along with macromolecules synthesis and couple these reactions with growth rate. This unique feature of the ME-model led to nonlinear growth curve predictions which matched closely with experimental growth rate data. At the theoretical maximum growth rate, the ME-model suggested a diminishing rate of carbon fixation and predicted malate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase as alternate electron sinks. Moreover, the ME-model also identified ferredoxin as a key regulator in distributing electrons between major redox balancing pathways. Since ME-models include turnover rate for each metabolic reaction, it was used to successfully capture experimentally observed temperature regulation of different nitrogenases. Overall, these unique features of the ME-model demonstrated the influence of nitrogenases and rubiscos on R. palustris growth and predicted a key regulator in distributing electrons between major redox balancing pathways, thus establishing a platform for in silico investigation of R. palustris metabolism from a multi-omics perspective.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this work, we reconstructed the first ME-model for a purple non-sulfur bacterium (PNSB). Using the ME-model, different aspects of R. palustris metabolism were examined. First, the ME-model was used to analyze how reducing power entering the R. palustris cell through organic carbon sources gets partitioned into biomass, carbon dioxide fixation, and nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, the ME-model predicted electron flux through ferredoxin as a major bottleneck in distributing electrons to nitrogenase enzymes. Next, the ME-model characterized different nitrogenase enzymes and successfully recapitulated experimentally observed temperature regulations of those enzymes. Identifying the bottleneck responsible for transferring electron to nitrogenase enzymes and recapitulating the temperature regulation of different nitrogenase enzymes can have profound implications in metabolic engineering, such as hydrogen production from R. palustris. Another interesting application of this ME-model can be to take advantage of its redox balancing strategy to gain understanding on regulatory mechanism of biodegradable plastic production precursors, such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).",

    "preprint_abstract": "Visual processing and behavior depend on specialized neural representations and information channels that encode distinct visual information and enable distinct computations. Our understanding of the neural substrate, however, remain severely limited by sparse recordings and the restricted range of visual areas and visual stimuli considered. We characterized in the mouse the multidimensional spatiotemporal tuning properties of > 30,000 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons across seven areas of the cortex. The dataset reveals population specialized for processing of oriented and non-oriented contrast, spatiotemporal frequency, and motion speed. Areal analysis reveals profound functional diversity and specificity as well as highly specific representations of visual processing channels in distinct visual areas. Clustering analysis shows a branching of visual representations along the posterior to anterior axis, and between lateral and dorsal areas. Overall, this dataset provides a cellular-resolution atlas for understanding organizing principles underlying sensory representations across the cortex.\n\nSummaryVisual representations and visual channels are the cornerstones of mammalian visual processing and critical for a range of life sustaining behaviors. However, the lack of data sets spanning multiple visual areas preclude unambiguous identification of visual processing streams and the sparse, singular recording data sets obtained thus far are insufficient to reveal the functional diversity of visual areas and to study visual information channels. We characterized the tunings of over 30,000 cortical excitatory neurons from 7 visual areas to a broad array of stimuli and studied their responses in terms of their ability to encode orientation, spatiotemporal contrast and visual motion speed. We found all mouse visual cortical areas convey diverse information but show distinct biases in terms of numbers of neurons tuned to particular spatiotemporal features. Neurons in visual areas differ in their spatiotemporal tuning but also in their relative response to oriented and unoriented contrast. We uncovered a population that preferentially responds to unoriented contrast and shows only weak responses to oriented stimuli. This population is strongly overrepresented in certain areas (V1, LM and LI) and underrepresented in others (AL, RL, AM, and PM). Spatiotemporal tunings are broadly distributed in all visual areas indicating that all areas have access to broad spatiotemporal information. However, individual areas show specific biases. While V1 is heavily biased in favor of low spatial and temporal frequencies, area LM responds more strongly to mid-range frequencies. Areas PM and LI are biased in favor of slowly-varying high-resolution signals. By comparison, anterior areas AL, RL and AM are heavily biased in favor of fast-varying, low to mid spatial frequency signals. Critically, theses biases express themselves in vastly different number of cells tuned to particular features, suggesting differential sampling of visual processing channels across areas. Comparing across areas, we found divergent visual representations between anterior and posterior areas, and between lateral and dorsal areas, suggesting the segregated organization of cortical streams for distinct information processing.",

However, it is currently unknown whether mice could perceive arbitrary optogenetic stimulation in addition to their evoked physiological functions. To address this issue, mice were trained to report an optogenetic stimulation as a cue to obtain rewards and avoid punishments. It was found that mice could perceive optogenetic manipulations regardless of the brain area modulated, their rewarding effects, or the stimulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic cell types. We named this phenomenon optoception. Using optoception, mice could learn to execute two different sets of instructions based on the laser frequency. Importantly, optoception can occur either activating or silencing a single cell type. Our findings revealed that mices brains are capable of \"monitoring\" their self-activity, albeit indirectly, perhaps via interoception or as a discriminative stimulus, opening a new way to introduce information to the brain and control brain-computer interfaces.",

    "preprint_abstract": "-Dystroglycan (-DG) is uniquely modified on O-mannose sites by a repeating disaccharide (-Xyl1,3-GlcA{beta}1,3-)n termed matriglycan, which is a receptor for laminin-G domain-containing proteins and employed by old-world arenaviruses for infection. Using chemoenzymatically synthesized matriglycans printed as a microarray, we demonstrated length-dependent binding to Laminin, Lassa virus GP1, and the clinically-important antibody IIH6. Utilizing an enzymatic engineering approach, an N-linked glycoprotein was converted into a IIH6-positive Laminin-binding glycoprotein. Engineering of the surface of cells deficient for either -DG or O-mannosylation with matriglycans of sufficient length recovered infection with a Lassa-pseudovirus. Finally free matriglycan in a dose and length dependent manner inhibited viral infection of wildtype cells. These results indicate that matriglycan alone is necessary and sufficient for IIH6 staining, Laminin and LASV GP1 binding, and Lassa-pseudovirus infection and support a model in which it is a tunable receptor for which increasing chain length enhances ligand-binding capacity.

    "preprint_abstract": "The obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis store glycogen in the lumen of the vacuoles in which they grow. Glycogen catabolism generates glucose-1-phosphate (Glc1P), while the bacteria are capable of taking up only glucose-6-phosphate (Glc6P). We tested whether the conversion of Glc1P into Glc6P could be catalyzed by a phosphoglucomutase (PGM) of host or bacterial origin. We found no evidence for the presence of the host enzyme in the vacuole. In C. trachomatis, two proteins are potential PGMs. By reconstituting the reaction, and by complementing PGM deficient fibroblasts, we demonstrated that only CT295 displayed robust PGM activity. Furthermore, we showed that glycogen accumulation by a subset of Chlamydia species correlated with the presence of a type three secretion (T3S) signal in their PGM. In conclusion, we established that the conversion of Glc1P into Glc6P was accomplished by a bacterial PGM, through the acquisition of a T3S signal in a \"housekeeping\" gene.",

    "preprint_abstract": "A central question in neuroscience is how the organization of cortical maps relates to perception, for which human primary visual cortex (V1) is an ideal model system. V1 nonuniformly samples the retinal image, with greater cortical magnification (surface area per degree of visual field) at the fovea than periphery and at the horizontal than vertical meridian. Moreover, the size and cortical magnification of V1 varies greatly across individuals. Here, we used fMRI and psychophysics in the same observers to quantify individual differences in V1 cortical magnification and contrast sensitivity at the four polar angle meridians. Across observers, the overall size of V1 and localized cortical magnification positively correlated with contrast sensitivity. Moreover, greater cortical magnification and higher contrast sensitivity at the horizontal than the vertical meridian were strongly correlated. These data reveal a link between cortical anatomy and visual perception at the level of individual observer and stimulus location.",

    "preprint_abstract": "Enzyme turnover numbers (kcat values) are key parameters to understand cell metabolism, proteome allocation and physiological diversity, but experimentally measured kcat data are sparse and noisy. Here we provide a deep learning approach to predict kcat values for metabolic enzymes in a high-throughput manner with the input of substrate structures and protein sequences. Our approach can capture kcat changes for mutated enzymes and identify amino acid residues with great impact on kcat values. Furthermore, we applied the approach to predict genome scale kcat values for over 300 yeast species, demonstrating that the predicted kcat values are consistent with current evolutional understanding. Additionally, we designed an automatic pipeline using the predicted kcat values to parameterize enzyme-constrained genome scale metabolic models (ecGEMs) facilitated by a Bayesian approach, which outperformed the default ecGEMs in predicting phenotypes and proteomes and enabled to explain phenotype differences among yeast species. The deep learning kcat prediction approach and automatic ecGEM construction pipeline would thus be a valuable tool to uncover the global trend of enzyme kinetics and physiological diversity, and to further elucidate cell metabolism on a large scale.",
