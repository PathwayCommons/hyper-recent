    "abstract": "Orthologs diverge after lineage separation events and paralogs after gene duplications. Thus, orthologs are expected to remain more functionally coherent across lineages, while paralogs have been proposed as a source of new functions. Because protein functional divergence follows from non-synonymous substitutions, we performed an analysis based on the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), as proxy for functional divergence. We used five working definitions of orthology, including reciprocal best hits (RBH), among other definitions based on network analyses and clustering. The results showed that orthologs, by all definitions tested, had values of dN/dS noticeably lower than those of paralogs, suggesting that, as a group, orthologs tend to be more functionally stable than paralogs. The differences in dN/dS ratios remained suggesting the functional stability of orthologs after eliminating gene comparisons with potential problems, such as genes with high codon usage biases, low coverage of either of the aligned sequences, or sequences with very high similarities. Separation by percent identity of the encoded proteins showed that the differences between the dN/dS ratios of orthologs and paralogs were more evident at high sequence identity, less so as identity dropped. While the last results partially explained the differences between dN/dS ratios of the two groups as being related to differences in protein identity, they also suggested that paralogs undergo functional divergence relatively early after duplication. Our analyses indicate that choosing orthologs as probably functionally coherent remains the right approach in comparative genomics.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe brain constantly processes information encoded in temporal sequences of spiking activity. This sequential activity emerges from sensory inputs as well as from the brains own recurrent connectivity and spans multiple dynamically changing timescales. Decoding the temporal order of spiking activity across these varying timescales is a critical function of the brain, but we do not yet understand its neural implementation. The problem is, that the passive dynamics of neural membrane potentials occur on a short millisecond timescale, whereas many cognitive tasks require the integration of information across much slower behavioral timescales. However, actively generated dendritic plateau potentials do occur on such longer timescales, and their essential role for many aspects of cognition has been firmly established by recent experiments. Here, we build on these discoveries and propose a new model of neural computation that emerges from the interaction of localized plateau potentials across a functionally compartmentalized dendritic tree. We show how this interaction offers a robust solution to the timing invariant detection and processing of sequential spike patterns in single neurons. Stochastic synaptic transmission complements the deterministic all-or-none plateau process and improves information transmission by allowing ensembles of neurons to produce graded responses to continuous combinations of features. We found that networks of such neurons can solve highly complex sequence detection tasks by breaking down long inputs into sequences of shorter, random features that can be classified reliably. These results suggest that active dendritic processes are fundamental to neural computation.",

    "abstract": "As the primary phagocytic cells of the central nervous system, microglia exquisitely regulate their lysosomal activity to facilitate brain development and homeostasis. However, mechanisms that coordinate lysosomal activity with microglia development, migration, and function remain unclear. Here we show that embryonic macrophages require the lysosomal GTPase RagA and the GTPase-activating protein Folliculin to colonize the brain in zebrafish. We demonstrate that embryonic macrophages in rraga mutants show increased expression of lysosomal genes but display significant downregulation of immune and migration-related genes. Furthermore, we find that RagA and Folliculin repress the key lysosomal transcription factor Tfeb, and its homologs Tfe3a and Tfe3b, in the macrophage lineage. Using RNA-Sequencing, we establish that Tfeb and Tfe3 are required for activation of lysosomal target genes under conditions of stress but not for basal expression of lysosomal pathways. Collectively, our data define a lysosomal regulatory circuit essential for macrophage development and function in vivo.\n\nTeaserThe degradation machinery of the cell must be carefully controlled for the normal formation and function of key immune cells called microglia.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive abilities are one of the major transdiagnostic domains in the National Institute of Mental Healths Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Following RDoCs integrative approach, we aimed to develop brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities that a) are developmentally stable over years during adolescence and b) account for the relationships between cognitive abilities and socio-demographic, psychological and genetic factors. For this, we leveraged the unique power of the large-scale, longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n [~]11k) and combined MRI data across modalities (task-fMRI from three tasks, resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, DTI) using machine-learning. Our brain-based, predictive models for cognitive abilities were stable across two years during young adolescence and generalisable to different sites, partially predicting childhood cognition at around 20% of the variance. Moreover, our use of  opportunistic stacking allowed the model to handle missing values, reducing the exclusion from around 80% to around 5% of the data. We found fronto-parietal networks during a working-memory task to drive childhood-cognition prediction. The brain-based, predictive models significantly, albeit partially, accounted for variance in childhood cognition due to (1) key socio-demographic and psychological factors (proportion mediated=18.65% [17.29%-20.12%]) and (2) genetic variation, as reflected by the polygenic score of cognition (proportion mediated=15.6% [11%-20.7%]). Thus, our brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities facilitate the development of a robust, transdiagnostic research tool for cognition at the neural level in keeping with the RDoCs integrative framework.\n\nKey PointsO_LIUsing opportunistic stacking and multimodal MRI, we developed brain-based predictive models for childrens cognitive abilities that were longitudinally stable, generalisable to different sites and robust against missing data.\nC_LIO_LIOur brain-based models were able to partially mediate the relationships of childhood cognitive abilities with the socio-demographic, psychological and genetic factors.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach should pave the way for future researchers to employ multimodal MRI as a tool for the brain-based indicator of cognitive abilities, according to the integrative RDoC framework.\nC_LI",

The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can be a signaling molecule regulating gene transcription. Thus, we assessed lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (K-bhb) levels in proteins extracted from the cerebral cortex of mice undergoing a ketogenic metabolic challenge (48 hrs fasting). We found that fasting enhanced K-bhb in a variety of proteins including histone H3. ChIP-seq experiments showed that K9 beta-hydroxybutyrylation of H3 (H3K9-bhb) was significantly enriched by fasting on more than 8000 DNA loci. Transcriptomic analysis showed that H3K9-bhb on enhancers and promoters correlated with active gene expression. One of the most enriched functional annotations both at the epigenetic and transcriptional level was \"circadian rhythms. Indeed, we found that the diurnal oscillation of specific transcripts was modulated by fasting at distinct zeitgebers both in the cortex and suprachiasmatic nucleus. Moreover, specific changes in locomotor activity daily features were observed during re-feeding after 48-hour fasting.\n\nThus, our results suggest that fasting dramatically impinges on the cerebral cortex transcriptional and epigenetic landscape, and BHB acts as a powerful epigenetic molecule in the brain through direct and specific histone marks remodeling in neural tissue cells.",

Although their independent effects have been reasonably well studied, their joint effects--particularly on coupled ecological and phenotypic dynamics--remain poorly understood. Here we experimentally manipulated temperature and nutrient levels in microbial food webs and used time-series analysis to quantify the strength of reciprocal effects between ecological and phenotypic dynamics across trophic levels. We found that i) joint -often interactive- effects of temperature and nutrients on ecological dynamics are more common at higher trophic levels, ii) temperature and nutrients interact to shift the relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up control, and iii) rapid phenotypic change mediates observed ecological responses to changes in temperature and nutrients. Our results expose how feedbacks between ecological and phenotypic dynamics mediate food web responses to environmental change. This suggests important but previously unknown ways that temperature and nutrients might jointly control the rapid eco-phenotypic feedbacks that determine food web dynamics in a changing world.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is commonly used to assess the tissue and cellular substructure of the human brain. In the white matter, myelinated axons are the principal neural elements that shape dMRI through the restriction of water diffusion; however, in the gray matter the relative contributions of myelinated axons and other tissue features to dMRI are poorly understood. Here we investigate the determinants of diffusion in the cerebral cortex. Specifically, we ask whether myelinated axons significantly shape dMRI fractional anisotropy (dMRI-FA), a measure commonly used to characterize tissue properties in humans. We compared ultra-high resolution ex vivo dMRI data from the brain of a marmoset monkey with both myelin- and Nissl-stained histological sections obtained from the same brain after scanning. We found that cortical diffusion was only minimally related to the density and arrangement of myelinated fibers. Instead, the spatial pattern of dMRI-FA in the cortex was more closely related to anisotropy of tissue features indicated in the Nissl stained sections. Our results suggest that unmyelinated neurites such as large caliber apical dendrites are the primary features shaping dMRI measures in the cerebral cortex.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the mechanisms used to repair DNA lesions during genome replication include homologous recombination between sister chromosomes. This can lead to the formation of chromosome dimers if an odd number of crossover events occurs. The concatenated DNA must be resolved before cell separation to ensure genomic stability and cell viability. The broadly conserved dif/Xer system counteracts the formation of dimers by catalyzing one additional crossover event immediately prior to cell separation. While dif/Xer systems have been characterized or predicted in the vast majority of proteobacteria, no homologs to dif or xer have been identified in the order Legionellales. Here we report the discovery of a distinct single-recombinase dif/Xer system in the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. The dif site was uncovered by our analysis of Legionella mobile element-1 (LME-1), which harbors a dif site-mimic and integrates into the L. pneumophila genome via site-specific recombination. We demonstrate that lpg1867 (herein named xerL) encodes a tyrosine recombinase that is necessary and sufficient for catalyzing recombination at the dif site, and that deletion of dif or xerL causes filamentation along with extracellular and intracellular growth defects. We show that the dif/XerL system is present throughout Legionellales and that Coxiella burnetii XerL and its cognate dif site can functionally substitute for the native system in L. pneumophila. Lastly, we describe an unexpected link between C. burnetii dif/Xer and the maintenance of its virulence plasmids.\n\nSignificance StatementThe maintenance of circular chromosomes depends on the ability to resolve aberrant chromosome dimers as they form. In most proteobacteria, broadly conserved Xer recombinases catalyze single crossovers at short, species-specific dif sites located near the replication terminus. Chromosomal dimerization leads to the formation of two copies of dif, leading to rapid site-specific recombination and elimination of the duplicated intervening sequence. The apparent absence of chromosome-dimer resolution mechanisms in Legionellales has been a mystery to date. By studying a phage-like mobile genetic element, LME-1, we have identified a previously unknown single-recombinase dif/Xer system that is not only widespread across Legionellales but whose activity is linked to virulence in two important human pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Although it is well established that motivational factors such as earning more money for performing well improve motor performance, how the motor system implements this improvement remains unclear. For instance, feedback-based control, which uses sensory feedback from the body to correct for errors in movement, improves with greater reward. But feedback control encompasses many feedback loops with diverse characteristics such as the brain regions involved and their response time. Which specific loops drive these performance improvements with reward is unknown, even though their diversity makes it unlikely that they are contributing uniformly. We systematically tested the effect of reward on the latency (how long for a corrective response to arise?) and gain (how large is the corrective response?) of seven distinct sensorimotor feedback loops in humans. Only the fastest feedback loops were insensitive to reward, and the earliest reward-driven changes were consistently an increase in feedback gains, not a reduction in latency. Rather, a reduction of response latencies only tended to occur in slower feedback loops. These observations were similar across sensory modalities (vision and proprioception). Our results may have implications regarding feedback control performance in athletic coaching. For instance, coaching methodologies that rely on reinforcement or \"reward shaping\" may need to specifically target aspects of movement that rely on reward-sensitive feedback responses.",

    "abstract": "The human ability to introspect on thoughts, perceptions or actions - metacognitive ability - has become a focal topic of both cognitive basic and clinical research. At the same time it has become increasingly clear that currently available quantitative tools are limited in their ability to make unconfounded inferences about metacognition. As a step forward, the present work introduces a comprehensive modeling framework of metacognition that allows for inferences about metacognitive noise and metacognitive biases during the readout of decision values or at the confidence reporting stage. The model assumes that confidence results from a continuous but noisy and potentially biased transformation of decision values, described by a confidence link function. A canonical set of metacognitive noise distributions is introduced which differ, amongst others, in their predictions about metacognitive sign flips of decision values. Successful recovery of model parameters is demonstrated, and the model is validated on an empirical data set. In particular, it is shown that metacognitive noise and bias parameters correlate with conventional behavioral measures. Crucially, in contrast to these conventional measures, metacognitive noise parameters inferred from the model are shown to be independent of performance. This work is accompanied by a toolbox (ReMeta) that allows researchers to estimate key parameters of metacognition in confidence datasets.",

    "abstract": "The tonic activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) is modified differentially by their afferent inputs. Although their unitary synaptic currents are identical, in most CINs cortical inputs onto distal dendrites only weakly entrain them, whereas proximal thalamic inputs trigger abrupt pauses in discharge in response to salient external stimuli. To test whether the dendritic expression of the active conductances that drive autonomous discharge contribute to the CINs capacity to dissociate cortical from thalamic inputs, we used an optogenetics-based method to quantify dendritic excitability. We found that the persistent sodium (NaP) current gave rise to dendritic boosting, and that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current gave rise to a subhertz membrane resonance. This resonance may underlie our novel finding of an association between CIN pauses and internally-generated slow wave events in sleeping non-human primates. Moreover, our method indicated that dendritic NaP and HCN currents were preferentially expressed in proximal dendrites. We validated the non-uniform distribution of NaP currents pharmacologically; with two-photon imaging of dendritic back-propagating action potentials; and by demonstrating boosting of thalamic, but not cortical, inputs by NaP currents. Thus, the localization of active dendritic conductances in CIN dendrites mirrors the spatial distribution of afferent terminals and may promote their differential responses to thalamic vs. cortical inputs.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal disorder and it is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Subjects with DS show a large heterogeneity of phenotypes and the most constant clinical features present are typical facies and intellectual disability (ID). Several studies demonstrated that trisomy 21 causes an alteration in the metabolic profile, involving among all one-carbon cycle. We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to identify the concentration of 5 different intermediates of the one-carbon cycle in plasma samples obtained from a total of 164 subjects with DS compared to 54 euploid subjects. We investigated: tetrahydrofolate (THF; DS n=108, control n=41), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF; DS n=140, control n=34), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formyl-THF; DS n=80, control n=21), S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH; DS n=94, control n=20) and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM; DS n=24, control n=15). Results highlight specific alterations of THF with a median concentration ratio DS/control of 2:3, a decrease of a necessary molecule perfectly consistent with a chromosomal dosage effect. Moreover, SAM and SAH show a ratio DS/control of 1.82:1 and 3.6:1, respectively. The relevance of these results for the biology of intelligence and its impairment in trisomy 21 is discussed, leading to the final proposal of 5-methyl-THF as the best candidate for a clinical trial aimed at restoring the dysregulation of one-carbon cycle in trisomy 21, possibly improving cognitive skills of subjects with DS.",

    "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging research on anxiety has traditionally focused on brain networks associated with the psychological aspects of anxiety. Here, instead, we target the somatic aspects of anxiety. Motivated by the growing appreciation that top-down cortical processing plays a crucial role in perception and action, we used resting-state functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to characterize effective connectivity among hierarchically organized regions in the exteroceptive, interoceptive, and motor cortices. In people with high (fear-related) somatic arousal, top-down effective connectivity was enhanced in all three networks: an observation that corroborates well with the phenomenology of anxiety. The anxiety-associated changes in connectivity were sufficiently reliable to predict whether a new participant has mild or severe somatic anxiety. Interestingly, the increase in top-down connections to sensorimotor cortex were not associated with fear affect scores, thus establishing the (relative) dissociation between somatic and cognitive dimensions of anxiety. Overall, enhanced top-down effective connectivity in sensorimotor cortices emerges as a promising and quantifiable candidate marker of trait somatic anxiety.",

    "abstract": "As the housekeeping genes generally involved in maintaining essential cell functions are typically assumed to exhibit constant expression levels across cell types, they are commonly employed as internal controls in gene expression studies. Nevertheless, multiple studies indicate that not all housekeeping genes display stable expression across cells and tissues and under various healthy and diseased conditions, which can introduce systematic errors into experimental results. The selection and validation of housekeeping genes as controls for each studied condition represent crucial steps in ensuring the validity of obtained results; however, up till now, sex has not been typically considered as a biological variable. In this study, we evaluate the expression profiles of six classical housekeeping genes (four metabolic: GAPDH, HPRT, PPIA, and UBC, and two ribosomal: 18S and RPL19) to determine expression stability in adipose tissues of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and check sex bias and their overall suitability as internal controls. We also assess the stabile expression of genes included in distinct whole-transcriptome microarrays available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify sex-unbiased housekeeping genes suitable for use as internal controls. We perform a sex-based analysis to describe any sexual dimorphisms in mRNA expression stability. A novel computational strategy based on meta-analysis techniques proves that certain classical housekeeping genes fail to function adequately as controls when analyzing human adipose tissue considering sex as a variable. The extensively used 18S gene displays sex-based variability in adipose tissue, although PPIA and RPL19 do not, and hence, represent robust housekeeping genes. We propose new sex-unbiased human and mouse housekeeping genes derived from sex-specific expression profiles, such as RPS8 and UBB. All results generated during this study are readily available by accessing an open web resource (https://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-HKG) for consultation and reuse in further studies.",

    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich clinical data collected at the point of the care, and their increasing adoption offers exciting opportunities for clinical informatics, disease risk prediction, and personalized treatment recommendation. However, effective use of EHR data for research and clinical decision support is often hampered by a lack of reliable disease labels. To compile gold-standard labels, researchers often rely on clinical experts to develop rule-based phenotyping algorithms from billing codes and other surrogate features. This process is tedious and error-prone due to recall and observer biases in how codes and measures are selected, and some phenotypes are incompletely captured by a handful of surrogate features. To address this challenge, we present a novel automatic phenotyping model called MixEHR-Guided (MixEHR-G), a multimodal hierarchical Bayesian topic model that efficiently models the EHR generative process by identifying latent phenotype structure in the data. Unlike existing topic modeling algorithms wherein the inferred topics are not identifiable, MixEHR-G uses prior information from informative surrogate features to align topics with known phenotypes. We applied MixEHR-G to an openly-available EHR dataset of 38,597 intensive care patients (MIMIC-III) in Boston, USA and to administrative claims data for a population-based cohort (PopHR) of 1.3 million people in Quebec, Canada. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that MixEHR-G learns interpretable phenotypes and yields meaningful insights about phenotype similarities, comorbidities, and epidemiological associations. Quantitatively, MixEHR-G outperforms existing unsupervised phenotyping methods on a phenotype label annotation task, and it can accurately estimate relative phenotype prevalence functions without gold-standard phenotype information. Altogether, MixEHR-G is an important step towards building an interpretable and automated phenotyping system using EHR data.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe development of remyelination-inducing therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has largely focused on driving oligodendrocyte differentiation. However, while rodent lesions display efficient remyelination and have a substantial oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) pool, the same is not true in MS lesions. Thus, we hypothesized that supernumerary densities of OPCs are required for efficient remyelination.\n\nMethodsWe characterized oligodendroglia dynamics in a rabbit model of lysolecithin-induced persistent demyelination. To investigate volume dependance of these effects, we induced both large (10x mouse volume) and small (1x) lesions.\n\nResultsFollowing WM demyelination, the density of mature oligodendrocytes failed to return to normal levels for at least 6 months, consistent with chronic demyelination. Similar to MS, the density of recruited OPCs in the rabbit rarely exceeded that of normal appearing white matter. OPC activation was substantially delayed/prolonged relative to murine lesions, however only a small portion underwent proliferation. Instead, we observed upregulation of the OPC quiescence marker, Prrx1, in the lesion border. While small lesions displayed decreased OPC proliferation and marginally improved rates of oligodendrogenesis, OPC density was equivalent to large lesions.\n\nInterpretationInefficient oligodendrogenesis in the rabbit is accompanied by limited OPC recruitment which, in turn, appears to be limited by insufficient proliferation and pathological Prrx1 quiescence. Prolonged OPC activation may prevent oligodendrocyte differentiation and decouple remyelination from the attendant inflammatory response. As such, the rabbit model provides a valuable tool for understanding the mechanisms which limit progenitor recruitment and thereby contribute to the failure of remyelination in MS.",

Yet data on population and harvest size, as well as population demographics of many species are limited.\nC_LIO_LIWe used a Demographic Invariant Method (DIM) to estimate Potential Excess Growth (PEG) for populations of waterbirds wintering in the UK and calculated a Sustainable Harvest Index (SHI) for each species or population. We compared this with population trends and conservation classifications (e.g. Birds of Conservation Concern) to assess the sustainability of harvests and the utility of these classifications.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach found evidence for potential overharvest in the United Kingdom of mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian teal Anas crecca, gadwall Mareca strepera, Canada geese Branta canadensis and both British and Icelandic greylag geese Anser anser. Whether DIM methods predict overharvest for ducks is highly dependent on estimates of maximum population growth rates inferring PEG. We found estimates of maximum population growth to be variable across a range of different methods.\nC_LIO_LIWe found no relationship between sustainable harvest indices and short-term or long-term wintering trends in harvested species, or conservation classification under the UKs Birds of Conservation Concern framework.\nC_LI\n\nPolicy ImplicationsOur results suggest that UK based harvest is unlikely to be a major determinant of population trends for overwintering waterbirds in the UK, but harvest rates for some species require further investigation. Additionally, the lack of a relationship between conservation classifications and SHI strongly suggests that these are not an appropriate tool for making decisions about harvest management. Our assessment provides the basis for a framework to make evidence-based decisions on sustainable harvest levels in the UK in the face of incomplete data.

    "abstract": "Upper body function is lost when injuries are sustained to the cervical spinal cord. Assistive machines can support the loss in upper body motor function. To regain functionality at the level of performing activities of daily living (e.g., self-feeding), though, assistive machines need to be able to operate in high dimensions. This means there is a need for interfaces with the capability to match high-dimensional operation. The body-machine interface provides this capability and has shown to be a suitable interface even for individuals with limited mobility. This is because it can take advantage of peoples available residual body movements. Previous studies using this interface have only shown that the interface can control low-dimensional assistive machines. In this pilot study, we demonstrate the interface can scale to high-dimensional robots, can be learned to control a 7-dimensional assistive robotic arm, to perform complex reaching and functional tasks, by an uninjured population. We also share results from various analyses that hint at learning, even when performance is extremely low. Decoupling intrinsic correlations between robot control dimensions seem to be a factor in learning--that is, proficiency in activating each control dimension independently may contribute to learning and skill acquisition of high-dimensional robot control. In addition, we show that learning to control the robot and learning to perform complex movement tasks can occur simultaneously.",

Thermal soaring birds rely on airflow, specifically wind support and uplift, to offset their energetic costs of flight. Their migratory routes are a record of movement decisions to negotiate the atmospheric environment and achieve efficiency. Because thermal soaring is a complex flight type that young birds need to learn, we expected that, as individuals gain more experience, their movement decisions will also increasingly favor the best thermal uplift conditions. We quantified how route choice during autumn migration of young European honey buzzards (Pernis apivorus) was adjusted to wind support and uplift over up to four years of migration and compared this to the choices of adult birds. We found that wind support was important in all migrations. However, we did not find an increase in the use of thermal uplifts, which could be an artifact of the uplift proxies that we used. Age-specific variations in response to airflow might occur at a smaller spatio-temporal scale than we investigated.",

    "abstract": "The fate of new mitochondrial and plastid mutations depends on their ability to persist and spread among the numerous organellar genome copies within a cell (heteroplasmy). The extent to which heteroplasmies are transmitted across generations or eliminated through genetic bottlenecks is not well understood in plants, in part because their low mutation rates make these variants so infrequent. Disruption of MutS Homolog 1 (MSH1), a gene involved in plant organellar DNA repair, results in numerous de novo point mutations, which we used to quantitatively track the inheritance of single nucleotide variants in mitochondrial and plastid genomes in Arabidopsis. We found that heteroplasmic sorting (the fixation or loss of a variant) was rapid for both organelles, greatly exceeding rates observed in animals. In msh1 mutants, plastid variants sorted faster than those in mitochondria and were typically fixed or lost within a single generation. Effective transmission bottleneck sizes for plastids and mitochondria were N {approx} 1 and 4, respectively. Restoring MSH1 function further increased the rate of heteroplasmic sorting in mitochondria (N {approx} 1.3), potentially due to its hypothesized role in promoting gene conversion as a mechanism of DNA repair, which is expected to homogenize genome copies within a cell. Heteroplasmic sorting also favored GC base pairs. Therefore, recombinational repair and gene conversion in plant organellar genomes can potentially accelerate the elimination of heteroplasmies and bias the outcome of this sorting process.\n\nSignificance statementMitochondria and plastids play essential roles in eukaryotic life; thus, mutations in these organellar genomes can have severe consequences. In animals, early germline sequestration creates genetic \"bottlenecks\" providing cell-to-cell variance in mitochondrial mutations upon which selection can act. However, the dynamics of organellar mutations in plants and other organisms that lack early germline segregation remain unclear. Here, we show that sorting of mutations in plant organellar genomes proceeds very rapidly - much faster than in animals. In mitochondria, this process is accelerated by MSH1, a gene involved in recombination and repair of organellar genomes. This suggests that in plants, recombinational repair creates cell-to-cell variance in the frequency of organellar mutations, facilitating selection in the absence of a classical germline bottleneck.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment, mortality remains high for many cancer types. Hence, innovative methods that use molecular data to stratify patients and identify biomarkers are needed. Promising biomarkers can also be inferred from competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks that capture the gene-miRNA-gene regulatory landscape. Thus far, the role of these biomarkers could only be studied globally but not in a sample-specific manner. To mitigate this, we introduce spongEffects, a novel method that infers subnetworks (or modules) from ceRNA networks and calculates patient- or sample-specific scores related to their regulatory activity. We show how spongEffects can be used for downstream interpretation and machine learning tasks such as tumor classification and for identifying subtype-specific regulatory interactions. In a concrete example of breast cancer subtype classification, we prioritize modules impacting the biology of the different subtypes. In summary, spongEffects prioritizes ceRNA modules as biomarkers and offers insights into the miRNA regulatory landscape. Notably, these module scores can be inferred from gene expression data alone and can thus be applied to cohorts where miRNA expression information is lacking.",

Whilst still images visually describe real spaces, and virtual reality allows for dynamic movement, each medium lacks the alternative attribute. To merge these benefits, we created and validated a novel dataset of valenced videos of first-person-view travel through built environments. This dataset was then used to clarify the relationship of core affect (valence and arousal) and architectural experience. Specifically, we verified the relationship between valence and fascination, coherence, and hominess - three key psychological dimensions of architectural experience which have previously been shown to explain aesthetic ratings of built environments. We also found that arousal is only significantly correlated with fascination, and that both are embedded in a relationship with spatial complexity and unusualness. These results help to clarify the nature of fascination, and to distinguish it from coherence and hominess when it comes to core affect. Moreover, these results demonstrate the utility of a video dataset of affect-laden spaces for understanding architectural experience.\n\nHighlights- Developed a video database of first-person-view journeys through built environments\n- We explored how core affect and architectural experience relate through the videos\n- Previous results are supported: valence ties to fascination, coherence and hominess\n- Arousal correlates only with fascination, and not coherence or hominess\n- Arousal and fascination are tied to spatial complexity and unusualness",

These have evolved from simple single cell-assays to increasingly complex models with integrated dermal equivalents and multiple cell types including a dermis, epidermis and vasculature. The development of micro-engineered platforms and biomaterials has enabled scientists to better recreate and capture the tissue microenvironment in vitro, including the vascularization of tissue models and their integration into microfluidic chips. However, to date, microvascularised human skin equivalents in a microfluidic context have not been reported. Here we present the design of a novel skin-on-a-chip model integrating human derived primary and immortalized cells in a full thickness skin equivalent. The model is housed in a microfluidic device, in which a microvasculature was previously established. We characterize the impact of our chip design on the quality of the microvascular networks formed and evidence that this enables the formation of more homogenous networks. We developed a methodology to harvest tissues from embedded chips, after 14 days of culture, and characterize the impact of culture conditions and vascularization (including with pericyte co-cultures) on the stratification of the epidermis in the resulting skin equivalents. Our results indicate that vascularization enhances stratification and differentiation (thickness, architecture and expression of terminal differentiation markers such as involucrin and transglutaminase 1), allowing formation of more mature skin equivalents in microfluidic chips. The skin-on-a-chip tissue equivalents developed, thanks to their realistic microvasculature, may find application for the testing efficacy and safety of therapeutics delivered systemically, in a human context.",

    "abstract": "Brown/beige adipocytes express uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) that enables them to dissipate energy as heat. Systematic activation of this process can alleviate obesity. Human brown adipose tissues are interspersed in distinct anatomical regions including deep neck. We found that UCP1 enriched adipocytes differentiated from precursors of this depot highly expressed ThTr2 transporter of thiamine and consumed thiamine during thermogenic activation of these adipocytes by cAMP which mimics adrenergic stimulation. Inhibition of ThTr2 led to lower thiamine consumption with decreased proton leak respiration reflecting reduced uncoupling. In the absence of thiamine, cAMP-induced uncoupling was diminished but restored by thiamine addition reaching the highest levels at thiamine concentrations larger than present in human blood plasma. Thiamine is converted to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in cells; the addition of TPP to permeabilized adipocytes increased uncoupling fueled by TPP-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase. ThTr2 inhibition also hampered cAMP-dependent induction of UCP1, PGC1a, and other browning marker genes, and thermogenic induction of these genes was potentiated by thiamine in a concentration dependent manner. Our study reveals the importance of amply supplied thiamine during thermogenic activation in human adipocytes which provides TPP for TPP-dependent enzymes not fully saturated with this cofactor and by potentiating the induction of thermogenic genes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/490662v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8b9a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1653d1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18f3266org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35f78d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAbundant thiamine is required for efficient activation of UCP1 dependent thermogenesis in human deep neck derived adipocytes\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of thiamine transporters leads to decreased thermogenic response\nC_LIO_LIIn stimulated adipocytes, thiamine supply provides extra thiamine pyrophosphate for increasing pyruvate dehydrogenase activity to generate sufficient fuel of UCP1 dependent respiration\nC_LIO_LIAdrenergic stimulation of thermogenic gene expression is potentiated by thiamine in a concentration dependent manner\nC_LI",

We report here that excess glucose leads to increased O-GlcNAcylation of DNMT1, resulting in inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) function and alterations to the epigenome. Using mass spectrometry and complementary alanine mutation experiments, we identified S878 as the major residue that is O-GlcNAcylated on DNMT1. Functional studies reveal that O-GlcNAcylation of DNMT1-S878 reduces its DNA methyltransferase activity. Treatment of cells with prolonged high glucose induces loss of DNA methylation, preferentially at partially methylated domains (PMDs). These results establish O-GlcNAcylation of DNMT1 as a mechanism through which the epigenome is regulated by glucose metabolism and implicates a role for glycosylation of DNMT1 in metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia.\n\nSignificanceGlucose metabolism results in production of O-GlcNAc, the substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation. The posttranslational modification of proteins with O-GlcNAcylation thereby serves as a nutrient sensor. We report that excess glucose leads to increased O-GlcNAcylation of DNMT1, resulting in inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) function.

    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in statistics, machine learning and genomics. Fast PCA methods, such as the accurate Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) and the fast Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD), are gaining popularity for capturing the top principal components efficiently. However, a fast and accurate PCA method with low memory usage is needed due to ever growing sample sizes. Here we present PCAone, a PCA framework with three PCA algorithms and an unified interface for different input data. We propose a new RSVD algorithm that can achieve high accuracy without passing through the data many times. Standard RSVD algorithms use the whole data matrix in each optimization step which makes out-of-core implementations slow. In contrast, PCAone uses a window based optimization scheme based on blocks of data which allows the algorithm to converge within a few passes through the whole data. Using largescale genetic data from the UK Biobank, we show that PCAone is much faster than existing state-of-the-art tools while using a negligible amount of memory and maintaining an accuracy comparable to the much slower IRAM algorithm. Applying PCAone to the imputed genotypes of the UK Biobank (around 0.5 million individuals and 6.1 millions common SNPs) took 9 hours using 13.5 GBs memory and 20 CPU threads to calculate the top 40 PCs which captured population structure, signals of selection (SLC45A2), structural variants and low recombination regions. PCAone applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data with 1.3 million mice brain cells took only 35 minutes to capture the top 20 PCs accurately.

    "abstract": "Cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) is an insect specific flavivirus (ISF) found in field and laboratory populations of Aedes aegypti. ISFs have recently demonstrated the ability to block the transmission of arboviruses such as dengue, West Nile and Zika viruses. It is thought that vertical transmission is the main route for ISF infections. This has been observed with CFAV, but there is evidence of horizontal and venereal transmission in other ISFs. Understanding the route of transmission can inform strategies to spread ISFs to wild vector populations as a method of controlling pathogenic arboviruses. We crossed individually reared male and female mosquitoes from both a naturally occurring CFAV-positive Ae. aegypti colony and its negative counterpart to provide information on maternal, paternal, and horizontal transmission. RT-PCR was used to detect CFAV in individual female mosquito pupal exuviae and was 89% sensitive, but only 41% in male mosquito pupal exuviae. This is a possible way to screen individuals for infection without destroying the adults. Female-to-male horizontal transmission was not observed during this study, however there was a 31% transmission rate from mating pairs of CFAV-positive males to negative female mosquitoes. Maternal vertical transmission was observed with a filial infection rate of 93%. The rate of paternal transmission was 85% when the female remained negative, 61% when the female acquired CFAV horizontally, and 76% overall. Maternal and paternal transmission of CFAV could allow the introduction of this virus into wild Ae. aegypti populations through male or female mosquito releases, and thus provides a potential strategy for ISF-derived arbovirus control.",

We reproduced available models of boreal woodland caribou resource selection and demography and evaluated their suitability for projecting impacts of development in the Ring of Fire on boreal caribou in the Missisa range (Ontario, Canada). The specificity of the resource selection model limited usefulness for predicting impacts, and high variability in model coefficients among ranges suggests responses vary with habitat availability. The aspatial demographic model projects decreasing survival and recruitment with increasing disturbance, but high variability among populations implies the importance of these impacts depends on population status, and there is no current status estimate. New models that are designed for forecasting, informed by more current herd status information and information from neighbouring ranges, are required to better inform decisions. To demonstrate how open-source tools and reproducible workflows can improve the transparency and reusability of models we developed an R package for data preparation, resource selection, and demographic calculations. Open-source tools, reproducible workflows, and reuseable forecasting models can improve our collective ability to inform wildlife management decisions in a timely manner.",

Relating individual cell-level mechanics to tissue-scale collective behavior is an outstanding challenge which cell-based models such as the cellular Potts model (CPM) are well-positioned to address. These models generally represent the ECM with mean-field approaches, which assume substrate homogeneity. This assumption breaks down with fibrous ECM, which has non-trivial structure and mechanics. Here, we extend the CPM with a bead-spring chain model of ECM fiber networks modelled using molecular dynamics. We model contractile cells pulling with discrete focal adhesion-like sites on the ECM fiber network, and demonstrate agreement with experimental spatiotemporal fiber densification and displacement. We show that contractile cell forces propagate over multiple cell radii scaling with power law exponent of {approx} -0.5 typical of viscoelastic ECM. Further, we use in silico atomic force microscopy to measure local cell-induced network stiffening consistent with experiments. Our model lays the foundation to investigate how local and long-ranged cell-ECM mechanobiology contributes to multicellular morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Neuroepithelial cells multitask, balancing tissue growth with the morphogenetic imperative of closing the neural tube. They apically constrict to generate mechanical forces which elevate the neural folds, but are thought to apically dilate during mitosis. However, we previously reported that mitotic neuroepithelial cells in the mouse posterior neuropore have smaller apical surfaces than non-mitotic cells. Here, we document progressive apical enrichment of non-muscle myosin-II in mitotic, but not non-mitotic, neuroepithelial cells with smaller apical areas. Live-imaging of the chick posterior neuropore confirms apical constriction synchronised with mitosis, reaching maximal constriction by anaphase, before division and re-dilation. Mitotic apical constriction amplitude is significantly greater than interphase constrictions. To investigate conservation in humans, we characterised early stages of iPSC differentiation through dual SMAD-inhibition to robustly produce pseudostratified neuroepithelia with apically enriched actomyosin. These cultured neuroepithelial cells achieve an equivalent apical area to those in mouse embryos. iPSC-derived neuroepithelial cells have large apical areas in G2 which constrict in M phase and retain this constriction in G1/S. Given that this differentiation method produces anterior neural identities, we studied the anterior neuroepithelium of the elevating mouse mid-brain neural tube. Instead of constricting, mid-brain mitotic neuroepithelial cells have larger apical areas than interphase cells. Tissue geometry differs between the apically convex early midbrain and concave posterior neuropore. Culturing human neuroepithelia on equivalently convex surfaces prevents mitotic apical constriction. Thus, synchronisation of apical constriction with the cell cycle is a geometry-dependent behaviour which reverses prior dilation in mitotic neuroepithelial cells of the closing vertebrate neural tube.",

The Munch pressure flow hypothesis (PFH) is considered the leading framework to mathematically represent this transport. It assumes that osmosis provides the necessary pressure differences to drive the fluid flow and sucrose within the phloem. Mathematical models utilizing the PFH approximate the phloem by a relatively rigid semi-permeable tube. However, the phloem consists of living cells that contract and expand in response to pressure fluctuations. The effect of membrane elasticity on osmotically driven sucrose front speed has rarely been considered and frames the scope here. Laboratory experiments were conducted to elucidate the elastic-to-plastic pressure-deformation relation in membranes and their effect on sucrose front speeds. It is demonstrated that membrane elasticity acts to retard the sucrose front speed. The retardation emerges because some of the osmotic pressure performs mechanical work to expand the membrane instead of pressurizing water. These results offer a novel perspective about the much discussed presence of sieve plates through-out the phloem acting as structural dampers.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi can sense useful resources and hazards in their environment and direct growth of their hyphae accordingly. Chemotropism ensures access to nutrients, contact with other individuals (e.g., for mating), and interaction with hosts in the case of pathogens. Previous studies have revealed a complex chemotropic sensing landscape during host-pathogen interactions, but the underlying molecular machinery remains poorly characterized. Here we studied mechanisms controlling directed hyphal growth of the important plant-pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae towards different chemoattractants. We found that the homologs of the Rag GTPase Gtr1 and the GTPase-activating protein Tsc2, an activator and a repressor of the TOR kinase respectively, play important roles in hyphal chemotropism towards nutrients, plant-derived signals, and heterologous -pheromone of Fusarium oxysporum. Furthermore, important roles of these regulators were identified in fungal development and pathogenicity. We also found that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Fus3 is required for chemotropism towards nutrients, while the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Ste2 and the MAPK Slt2 control chemosensing of plant-derived signals and -pheromone. Our study establishes V. dahliae as a suitable model for the analysis of fungal chemotropism and discovers new components of chemotropic signaling, during growth and host-pathogen interactions of V. dahliae.",

While the importance of dimethylation of H3K4 mark for centromeric transcription has been highlighted in various studies, the identity of the enzyme(s) depositing these marks on the centromere is still unknown. The MLL (KMT2) family play a crucial role in RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated gene regulation by methylating H3K4. Here, we report that MLL family regulate transcription of human centromeres. CRISPR-mediated downregulation of MLL causes loss of H3K4me2, resulting in an altered epigenetic chromatin state of the centromeres. Intriguingly, our results reveal that loss of MLL, but not SETD1A, increases co-transcriptional R-loop formation, and Pol II accumulation at the centromeres. Finally we report that the presence of MLL and SETD1A is crucial for kinetochore maintenance. Altogether, our data reveals a novel molecular framework where both the H3K4 methylation mark and the methyltransferases regulate stability and identity of the centromere.",

It remains unclear whether they are simply clusters of independent classical enhancers or whether SEs manifest emergent properties and should therefore be considered as a distinct class of element. Here, using synthetic biology and genome editing, we engineered the well characterised erythroid -globin SE at the endogenous -globin locus, removing all SE constituent elements in a mouse embryonic stem cell-line, to create a \"blank canvas\". This has allowed us to re-build the SE through individual and combinatorial reinsertion of its five elements (R1, R2, R3, Rm, R4), to test the importance of each constituents sequence and position within the locus. Each re-inserted element independently creates a region of open chromatin and binds its normal repertoire of transcription factors; however, we found a high degree of functional interdependence between the five constituents. Surprisingly, the two strongest -globin enhancers (R1 and R2) act sub-optimally both on their own and in combination, and although the other three elements (R3, Rm and R4) exhibit no discernible enhancer activity, they each exert a major positive effect in facilitating the activity of the classical enhancers (R1 and R2). This effect depends not simply on the sequence of each element but on their positions within the cluster. We propose that these \"facilitators\" are a novel form of regulatory element, important for ensuring the full activity of SEs, but distinct from conventional enhancer elements.",

Although invasive recordings suggest that sensory experience promotes single-cell and population-level plasticity in adults, the brain-wide topography of sensory remapping remains unknown. Here, we investigated topographic remapping in the adult rodent visual pathway using functional MRI (fMRI) coupled with a first-of-its-kind setup for delivering patterned visual stimuli in the scanner. Using this novel setup, and coupled with biologically-inspired computational models, we were able to noninvasively map brain-wide properties (receptive fields (RFs) and spatial frequency (SF) tuning curves) that were insofar only available from invasive electrophysiology or optical imaging. We then tracked the RF dynamics in the chronic Visual Deprivation Model (VDM), and found that light exposure progressively promoted a large-scale topographic remapping in adults. Upon light exposure, the initially unspecialized visual pathway progressively evidenced sharpened RFs (smaller and more spatially selective) and enhanced bandpass filters in SF tuning curves. Our findings reveal that visual experience following VDM reshapes the structure and function of the visual system and shifts the stability/plasticity balance in adults.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe sensation of breathlessness is often attributed to perturbations in cardio-pulmonary physiology, leading to changes in afferent signals. New evidence suggests that these signals are interpreted in the light of prior \"expectations\". A misalignment between afferent signals and expectations may underly unexplained breathlessness. Using a novel immersive virtual reality (VR) exercise paradigm, we investigated whether manipulating an individuals expectation of effort (determined by a virtual hill gradient) may alter their perception of breathlessness, independent from actual effort (the physical effort of cycling).\n\nMethodsNineteen healthy volunteers completed a single experimental session where they exercised on a cycle ergometer while wearing a VR headset. We created an immersive virtual cycle ride where participants climbed up 100 m hills with virtual gradients of 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% and 12%. Each virtual hill gradient was completed twice: once with a 4% cycling ergometer resistance and once with a 6% resistance, allowing us to dissociate expected effort (virtual hill gradient) from actual effort (physical effort of pedalling). At the end of each hill, participants reported their perceived breathlessness. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the independent contribution of actual effort and expected effort to ratings of breathlessness (0-10 scale).\n\nResultsExpectation of effort (effect estimate {+/-} std. error, 0.63 {+/-} 0.11, p<0.001) and actual effort (0.81 {+/-} 0.21, p<0.001) independently explained subjective ratings of breathlessness, with comparable contributions of 19% and 18%, respectively. Additionally, we found that effort expectation accounted for 6% of participants physical effort of pedalling and was a significant, independent predictor (0.09 {+/-} 0.03; p=0.001).\n\nConclusionsAn individuals expectation of effort is equally important for forming perceptions of breathlessness as the actual effort required to cycle. A new VR paradigm enables this to be experimentally studied and could be used to re-align breathlessness and enhance training programmes.",

Endothelial APP expression in APP-knock-in mice was recently shown to expand CAA pathology, highlighting endothelial APPs importance. Furthermore, two types of endothelial APP--with and without O-glycans--have been biochemically identified, but only the former is cleaved for A{beta} production, indicating the critical relationship between APP O-glycosylation and processing. Here, we analyzed APP glycosylation and its intracellular trafficking in neurons and endothelial cells. Although protein glycosylation is generally believed to precede cell surface trafficking, which was true for neuronal APP, we unexpectedly observed that APP lacking O-glycans is externalized to the endothelial cell surface and transported back to the Golgi apparatus, where it then acquires O-glycans. Knockdown of genes encoding enzymes initiating APP O-glycosylation significantly reduced A{beta} production, suggesting this non-classical glycosylation pathway contributes to CAA pathology and is a novel therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring embryonic development, the mesoderm undergoes patterning into diverse lineages including axial, paraxial, and lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Within the LPM, the so-called intermediate mesoderm (IM) forms kidney and urogenital tract progenitor cells, while remaining LPM forms cardiovascular, hematopoietic, mesothelial and additional progenitor cells. The signals that regulate these early lineage decisions are incompletely understood. Here, we found that the centrosomal protein 83 (CEP83), a centriolar component necessary for primary cilia formation and mutated in pediatric kidney disease, influences the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) towards intermediate mesoderm.\n\nMethodsWe induced inactivating deletions of CEP83 in hiPSCs and applied a 7 day in vitro protocol of intermediate mesoderm kidney progenitor differentiation, based on timed application of WNT and FGF agonists. We characterized induced mesodermal cell populations using single cell and bulk transcriptomics and tested their ability to form kidney structures in subsequent organoid culture.\n\nResultsWhile hiPSCs with homozygous CEP83 inactivation were normal regarding morphology and transcriptome, their induced differentiation into IM progenitor cells was perturbed. Mesodermal cells induced after 7 days of monolayer culture of CEP83-deficient hiPCS exhibited absent or elongated primary cilia, displayed decreased expression of critical IM genes (PAX8, EYA1, HOXB7) and an aberrant induction of LPM markers (e. g. FOXF1, FOXF2, FENDRR, HAND1, HAND2). Upon subsequent organoid culture, wildtype cells differentiated to form kidney tubules and glomerular-like structures, whereas CEP83-deficient cells failed to generate kidney cell types, instead upregulating cardiomyocyte, vascular, and more general LPM progenitor markers.\n\nConclusionOur data suggest that CEP83 regulates the balance of intermediate mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm formation from human pluripotent stem cells, identifying a potential link between centriolar or ciliary function and mesodermal lineage induction.",

    "abstract": "Colourful patterns on flowers are thought to benefit both pollinators and the plants they visit, by increasing the plants pollination success via an improved foraging efficiency of its pollinators. This increased efficiency is thought to result from a guidance effect of the flower patterns, correspondingly termed  nectar guides, which indicate the position of the nectary to visiting pollinators. While it is well established that flower patterns play an important role in flower choice, the mechanisms underlying their function for flower-visiting insects remain poorly understood. In this study, we quantified the contributions of patterns to all phases of flower interaction in the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris). We analysed their flight paths, as well as landing positions and walking tracks on artificial flowers with different pattern types. We reveal that flower patterns improved the overall foraging efficiency of the bees by up to 30%, by guiding their approach flight, landing positions, and departure decisions. Surprisingly, these effects were not related to nectary guidance. Since we conducted the experiments with experienced foragers, which represent the majority of insect pollinators active in nature, the newly described nectary-independent guidance effects of flower patterns are of fundamental importance to plant-pollinator interactions under natural conditions.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of most protozoa encode families of variant surface antigens, whose mutually exclusive changes in expression allow parasitic microorganisms to evade the host immune response1,2. It is widely assumed that antigenic variation in protozoan parasites is accomplished by the spontaneous appearance within the population of cells expressing antigenic variants that escape antibody-mediated cytotoxicity1,2. Here we show, both in vitro and in animal infections, that antibodies to Variant-specific Surface Proteins (VSPs) of the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia are not cytotoxic, inducing instead VSP clustering into liquid-ordered phase membrane microdomains that trigger a massive release of microvesicles carrying the original VSP and switch in expression to different VSPs by a calcium-dependent mechanism. Surface microvesiculization and antigenic switching are also stimulated when Trypanosoma brucei and Tetrahymena thermophila are confronted to antibodies directed to their GPI-anchored variable surface glycoproteins. This novel mechanism of surface antigen clearance throughout its release into microvesicles coupled to the stochastic induction of new phenotypic variants not only changes the current paradigm of spontaneous antigenic switching but also provides a new framework for understanding the course of protozoan infections as a host/parasite adaptive process.",

In contrast, however, the role of dynamics as a link between structure and function has eluded a similarly clear-cut verification and description. In this work, we propose a pipeline aimed at building a basis for the quantitative characterisation of the large-scale dynamics of a set of proteins, starting from the sole knowledge of their native structures. The method hinges on a dynamics-based clusterization, which allows a straightforward comparison with structural and functional protein classifications. The resulting basis set, obtained through the application to a group of related proteins, is shown to reproduce the salient large-scale dynamical features of the dataset. Most interestingly, the basis set is shown to encode the fluctuation patterns of homologous proteins not belonging to the initial dataset, thus highlighting the general applicability of the pipeline used to build it.",

    "abstract": "Voltage gated sodium channels play an important role in electrical signaling in excitable cells. In response to changes in membrane potential, they cycle between nonconducting and conducting conformations. With recent advances in structural biology, structures of sodium channels have been captured in several distinct conformations, thought to represent different functional states. However, it has been difficult to capture the intrinsically transient open state. We recently showed that a proposed open state of the bacterial sodium channel NavMs was not conductive, and that a conformational change involving a transition to a{pi} helix in the pore-lining S6 helix converted this structure into a conducting state. However, the relevance of this structural feature in other sodium channels, and its implications for the broader gating cycle, remained unclear. Here, we propose a comparable open state of another class of bacterial channel from Aliarcobacter butzleri (NavAb), with characteristic pore hydration, ion permeation and drug binding properties. Furthermore, we show that a{pi} -helix transition is essential for pore opening, and that such a conformational change blocks fenestrations in the inner helix bundle. We also discover that a region in the C-terminal domain can undergo a disordering transition proposed to be important for pore opening. These results support a role for a{pi} -helix transition in the opening of NavAb, enabling new proposals for the structural annotation and drug modulation mechanisms in this important model sodium channel.",

    "abstract": "KCa2.1-3 Ca2+-activated K+-channels (SK) require calmodulin to gate in response to cellular Ca2+. A widely accepted model for SK gating proposes that the N-terminal domain (N-lobe) of calmodulin is required for activation, but an immobile C-terminal domain (C-lobe) has constitutive, Ca2+-independent binding. Although structures support such a domain-driven hypothesis of SK gate activation by calmodulin, only a partial understanding is possible without measuring both channel activity and protein binding. We measured SK2 (KCa2.2) activity using inside-out patch recordings. Currents from \"calmodulin-disrupted\" SK2 channels can be restored with exogenously applied calmodulin. We find that SK2 activity only approaches full activation with full-length calmodulin with both an N- and C-lobe. We measured calmodulin binding to a C-terminal SK peptide (SKp) using both composition-gradient multi-angle light scattering and tryptophan emission spectra. Isolated lobes bind to a SKp with high affinity, but isolated lobes do not rescue SK2 activity. Consistent with earlier models, N-lobe binding to SKp is stronger in Ca2+, and C-lobe binding affinity is strong independent of Ca2+. However, a native tryptophan in SKp is sensitive to Ca2+ binding to both the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin at Ca2+ concentrations that activate SK2, demonstrating that the C-lobe interaction with SKp changes with Ca2+. We interpret the Ca2+-dependence of calmodulins associations to the C-terminus of SK2 as crucial events that happen during gating. Our results show that both lobes bound to SK are Ca2+ sensitive and that both are involved in multiple interactions governed by properties unique to each lobe.",

    "abstract": "Failure to clear damaged mitochondria via mitophagy disrupts physiological function and may initiate damage signaling via inflammatory cascades. However, signaling mechanisms leading from impaired mitophagy to neuro-inflammation are unclear. We discovered that NF-{kappa}B essential regulator NEMO is recruited to damaged mitochondria in a Parkin- and p62/SQSTM1-dependent manner in a time-course similar to recruitment of the structurally-related mitophagy receptor, OPTN. NEMO and p62 colocalize, partitioning into distinct domains from OPTN. Either depletion of p62 or mutation of NEMOs ubiquitin-binding domain abolishes NEMO recruitment, indicating multifactorial interactions. The active catalytic IKK component phospho-IKK{beta} colocalizes with NEMO on damaged mitochondria, initiating NF-{kappa}B signaling and the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that damaged mitochondria serve as an intracellular platform for innate immune signaling by promoting the formation of activated IKK complexes in a Parkin-dependent manner. We propose that mitophagy and NF-{kappa}B signaling are competing pathways regulating the response to cellular stress.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding (high-throughput sequencing of marker gene amplicons) has emerged as a promising and cost-effective method for characterizing insect community samples. Yet, the methodology varies greatly among studies and its performance has not been systematically evaluated to date. In particular, it is unclear how accurately metabarcoding can resolve species communities in terms of presence-absence, abundances, and biomass. Here we use mock community experiments and a simple probabilistic model to evaluate the performance of different metabarcoding protocols. Specifically, we ask four questions: (Q1) How consistent are the recovered community profiles across replicate mock communities?; (Q2) How does the choice of lysis buffer affect the recovery of the original community?; (Q3) How are community estimates affected by differing lysis times and homogenization?; and (Q4) Is it possible to obtain adequate species abundance estimates through the use of biological spike-ins? We show that estimates are quite variable across community replicates. In general, a mild lysis protocol is better at reconstructing species lists and approximate counts, while homogenization is better at retrieving biomass composition. Tiny insects are more likely to be detected in lysates, while some tough species require homogenization to be detected. Results are less consistent across biological replicates for lysates than for homogenates. Some species are associated with strong PCR amplification bias, which complicates the reconstruction of species counts. Yet, with adequate spike-in data, species abundance can be determined with roughly 40% standard error for homogenates, and with roughly 50% standard error for lysates, under ideal conditions. In the latter case, however, this often requires species-specific reference data, while spike-in data generalizes better across species for homogenates. We conclude that a non-destructive, mild lysis approach shows the highest promise for presence/absence description of the community, while also allowing future morphological or molecular work on the material. However, homogenization protocols perform better for characterizing community composition, in particular in terms of biomass.",

Inflammation increases the activity of the kynurenine pathway, which is linked to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. We sought to determine whether the kynurenine pathway is impacted in patients with mild COVID-19, leading to elevated neurotoxic metabolites in blood, and whether such changes are associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Serum samples were taken from 150 patients and analyzed by ELISA and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models adjusted for age and sex. We found increased levels of kynurenine, quinolinic acid and 3-hydroxykynurenine in serum from patients with mild COVID-19, together with increased levels of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and neopterin. The levels of neurotoxic metabolites were significantly associated with key inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF. The COVID-19 risk-factor hypertension was associated with the highest levels of neurotoxic metabolites in plasma.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a role in the mortality of more than 6 million people worldwide. This virus owns the genome, which contains four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The occurrence of structural mutations can induce the emergence of new variants. Depending on the mutations, the variants may display different patterns of infectivity, mortality, and sensitivity toward drugs and vaccines. In this study, we analyzed samples of amino-acid sequences (AASs) for structural proteins from the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) declaration as a pandemic to April 2022 among American countries. The analysis process included considering mutations frequencies, locations, and evolutionary trends utilizing sequence alignment to the reference sequence. In the following, the results were compared with the same analyses among the samples of the entire world. Results displayed that despite samples of North America and international countries that own the region of 508 to 635 with the highest mutation frequency among S AASs, the region with the same characteristic was concluded as 1 to 127 in South America. Besides, the most frequent mutations in S, E, M, and N proteins from North America and worldwide samples were concluded as D614G, T9I, I82T, and R203M. In comparison, R203K was the first frequent mutation in N samples in South America. Widely comparing mutations between North America and South America and between the Americas and the world can help scientists introduce better drug and vaccine development strategies.",

To characterize the within-host evolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, we deep sequenced saliva and nasal samples collected daily from immune and unvaccinated individuals early during infection. We show that longitudinal sampling facilitates high-confidence genetic variant detection and reveals evolutionary dynamics missed by less-frequent sampling strategies. Within-host dynamics in both naive and immune individuals appeared largely stochastic; however, we identified clear mutational hotspots within the viral genome, consistent with selection and differing between naive and immune individuals. In rare cases, minor genetic variants emerged to frequencies sufficient for forward transmission. Finally, we detected significant genetic compartmentalization of virus between saliva and nasal swab sample sites in many individuals. Altogether, these data provide a high-resolution profile of within-host SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "As we enter the next phase of international policy commitments to halt biodiversity loss (e.g. Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework), biodiversity indicators will play an important role forming the robust basis upon which targeted, and time sensitive conservation actions are developed. Population trend indicators are perhaps the most powerful tool in biodiversity monitoring due to their responsiveness to changes over short timescales and their ability to aggregate species trends from global down to at a sub-national or even local scale. We consider how the project behind the foremost population level indicator - the Living Planet Index - has evolved over the last 25 years, its value to the field of biodiversity monitoring, and how its components have portrayed a compelling account of the changing status of global biodiversity through its application at policy, research and practice levels. We explore ways the project can develop to enhance our understanding of the state of biodiversity and share lessons learned to inform indicator development and mobilise action.\n\nO_TEXTBOXBox 1. The Living Planet Index Project\n\nThe Living Planet Index project (the index, methodology, and database) and its secondary outputs (methods papers and R code, database and website, global index, and subset indices) have had wide-ranging applications within the fields of biodiversity monitoring and research, as well as across policy, education, and outreach.\n\nThe Living Planet Index (LPI) is a biodiversity indicator which tracks trends in the relative abundance of wild vertebrate populations (where population is defined as to a single species in a defined location rather than the biological definition). Relative abundance captures how populations are changing over time on average in comparison to a reference point, or \"baseline\" (the LPI uses 1970). It is often described as analogous to a stock market index for species. The index is comprised of thousands of population time-series for vertebrate species from locations around the world; the trends from these populations are averaged to produce terrestrial, freshwater, and marine indices, which are further aggregated to a global LPI. The latest global LPI shows a decline of 68% between 1970 and 2016 globally 1. This is an average trend based on time-series data from 20,811 populations of 4,392 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.\n\nThe LPI database (LPD) can include population data for any species for which time-series population data could be found, regardless of threat status, or whether they show increasing or declining trends. These population time-series are sourced from scientific papers, online databases, government, and expert led published reports. They can be searched and downloaded from the project website (www.livingplanetindex.org). More technical information is available on the LPI stats website (http://stats.livingplanetindex.org/).\n\nC_TEXTBOX",

    "abstract": "The phylogeny of gall wasps (Cynipidae) and their parasitic relatives has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The family is now widely recognized to fall into thirteen natural lineages, designated tribes, but the relationships among them have remained elusive. This has stymied any progress in understanding how cynipid gall inducers evolved from insect parasitoids, and what role inquilinism (development as a herbivore inside galls induced by other cynipids) might have played in this transition. A recent analysis of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) represents the first attempt at resolving these questions using phylogenomics. Here, we present the first analysis based on protein-coding sequences from genome and transcriptome assemblies. To address potential problems due to model misfit, we focus on models that accommodate site-specific amino-acid profiles and that are less sensitive than standard models to long-branch attraction. Our results show that the Cynipidae as previously circumscribed are not monophyletic. Specifically, the Paraulacini and a clade formed by Diplolepidini + Pediaspidini both fall outside a core clade (Cynipidae s. str.), which is more closely related to Figitidae. This result is robust to the exclusion of long-branch taxa that could potentially mislead the analysis, and it is consistent with the UCE analysis. Given this, we propose that the Cynipidae be divided into three families: the Paraulacidae, Diplolepididae and Cynipidae (s. str.). Our results suggest that the Eschatocerini are the sister group of the remaining Cynipidae (s. str.). Within the latter, our results are consistent with the UCE analysis but place two additional tribes: (1) the Aylacini (s. str.), more closely related to the oak gall wasps (Cynipini) and some of their inquilines (Ceroptresini) than to other herb gallers (Aulacideini and Phanacidini); and (2) the Qwaqwaiini, likely the sister group to Synergini (s. str.) + Rhoophilini. Several alternative scenarios for the evolution of cynipid life histories are compatible with the relationships suggested by our analysis, but all are complex and require multiple shifts between parasitoids, inquilines and gall inducers. Linking the different types of life-history transitions to specific genomic signatures may be one of the best ways of differentiating among these alternative scenarios. Our study represents the first step towards enabling such analyses.",

Cell count, cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cell adhesion were measured. CI electrodes were implanted into murine cochleae for one week without electrical stimulation. Implanted cochleae were harvested for 3D X-ray microscopy with the CI left in-situ. The location of new bone growth within the scala tympani (ST) with reference to different portions of the implant (PDMS vs platinum) was quantified.\n\nResultsCell counts of macrophages and fibroblasts were significantly higher on platinum substrates and platinum contacts of CI electrodes. Fibroblast proliferation was greater on platinum relative to PDMS, and cells grown on platinum formed more/larger focal adhesions. 3D x-ray microscopy showed neo-ossification in the peri-implant areas of the ST. Volumetric quantification of neo-ossification showed a trend toward greater bone formation adjacent to the platinum electrodes compared to areas opposite or away from the platinum electrode bearing surfaces.\n\nConclusionsFibrotic reactions are biomaterial specific, as demonstrated by the differences in cell adhesion, proliferation, and fibrosis on platinum and PDMS. The inflammatory reaction to platinum contacts on CI electrodes likely contributes to fibrosis to a greater degree than PDMS, and platinum contacts may influence the deposition of new bone, as demonstrated in the in vivo data. This information can potentially be used to influence the design of future generations of neural prostheses.",

We illustrate the use of the selected similarity measures in diagnosing differences within two extremely contrasting sets of biological data, which, remarkably, may both be relevant for magnetic field perception by migratory birds.

However, an important portion of the significant changes observed in transcriptomics at the gene level is usually not consistently detected at the protein level by proteomics. This poor correlation between the measured transcriptome and proteome is probably mainly due to post-transcriptional regulation, among which miRNA and circRNA have been proposed to play an important role. Therefore, since both miRNA and circRNA are also quantified by transcriptomics, we proposed to build a model taking those factors into account to estimate, for each transcript, the fraction of transcripts that would be available for translation. Using a dataset of cells exposed to diverse compounds, we evaluated how our model was able to improve the correlation between the assessed transcriptome and proteome expression level. The results show that the model improved the correlation for a subset of genes, probably due to the regulation of different miRNAs across the genome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver the past few months, we have witnessed a new outbreak of a MPXV that has been detected without a clear link to Africa and has quickly spread globally.\n\nMethodsIn this article we investigate the mutational pattern of the MPXV and provide evidence for the presence of 6 new mutations that appear to characterize the current MPX-2022 outbreak. With the use of a number of chemical and physical parameters, we predict the stability of the mutated proteins, and propose an interpretation of the impact of these mutations on viral fitness).\n\nFindingsMost mutations, particularly the Immunomodulator A46, TNFr and Large transcript constituent, affect proteins playing an important role in host response to MPVX infection and could also be relevant to the clinical features of the 2022 MPXV outbreak.\n\nInterpretationAlthough further, experimental work is necessary for a full understanding of the impact of the mutations here reported on virus replication pathways and host immunomodulation, our in-silico data suggest the importance of monitoring the emergence of new MPXV mutations for the prevention of future outbreaks potentially dangerous for public health.\n\nFundingNo funding to declare",

    "abstract": "Flavoring chemicals utilized in electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have been shown to result in an increase in cellular inflammation, meanwhile, the effects of fruit and tobacco flavors on lung inflammation by nose-only exposures to mice are relatively unknown. We hypothesized that C57BL/6J mice exposed to flavored e-cigarettes would result in an increase in lung inflammation. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to air, propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG/VG), and e-liquids \"Apple\", \"Cherry\", \"Strawberry\", \"Wintergreen\", and \"Smooth & Mild Tobacco\", for one hour per day for a three day exposure. Quantification of flavoring chemicals was measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), differential cell counts by flow cytometry, pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines by ELISA, and matrix metalloproteinase levels by western blot. Exposure to PG/VG, Apple, and Smooth & Mild Tobacco resulted in an increase in neutrophil cell count in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Strawberry exposure increased KC levels in BALF while in lung homogenate KC levels were increased in PG/VG, Cherry, and Smooth & Mild Tobacco exposure. Exposure to PG/VG and Cherry increased IL-6 levels and in all exposed mice there was a male-specific decrease in MCP-1 levels in lung homogenate. Mice exposed to PG/VG, Apple, Cherry, and Wintergreen resulted in an increase in MMP2 levels. Our results indicate that female mice exposed to cherry flavored e-liquids and male mice exposed to tobacco flavored e-liquids resulted in an increase in inflammation, while exposure to mint flavored e-liquids resulted in a decrease in inflammatory cytokine and an increase in tissue repair proteins. This study revealed that flavored-based e-cigarette exposure elicited sex-specific alterations in lung inflammation, with cherry flavors/benzaldehyde eliciting female-specific increases in inflammation. This highlights the toxicity of flavored chemicals and the further need for regulation of flavoring chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Flooding caused or exacerbated by climate change has threatened plant growth and food production worldwide. The lack of knowledge on how crops respond and adapt to flooding stress imposes a major barrier to enhancing their productivity. Hence, understanding the flooding-responsive mechanisms of crops is indispensable for developing new flooding-tolerant varieties. Here, we examined the banana (Musa acuminata cv. Berangan) responses to soil waterlogging for 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 24 days. After waterlogging stress, banana root samples were analyzed for their molecular and biochemical changes. We found that waterlogging treatment induced the formation of adventitious roots and aerenchyma with conspicuous gas spaces. In addition, the antioxidant activities, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde contents of the waterlogged bananas increased in response to waterlogging stress. To assess the initial response of bananas toward waterlogging stress, we analyzed the transcriptome changes of banana roots. A total of 3,508 unigenes were differentially expressed under 1-day waterlogging conditions. These unigenes comprise abiotic stress-related transcription factors, such as ethylene response factors, basic helix-loop-helix, myeloblastosis, plant signal transduction, and carbohydrate metabolisms. The findings of the study provide insight into the complex molecular events of bananas in response to waterlogging stress, which could later help develop waterlogging resilient crops for the future climate.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have enhanced the identification of molecular biomarkers specific to phenotypes or states in bacteria. Using these biomarkers to monitor the state of bacteria used in biotechnological processes promises to increase process efficiency. However, live-cell monitoring systems applied to recognise bacterial cellular states in real time can only accommodate a small number of gene expression biomarkers. Computational methods are required to identify and prioritise robust biomarkers for experimental characterisation and verification. This study focused on designing a knowledge integration strategy for the selection of an optimal minimised gene expression biomarker panel to sense various stress states in Bacillus subtilis. We developed a computational method that ranks the candidate biomarker panels based on complementary information from machine learning model, gene regulatory network and co-expression network. We identified a recommended biomarker panel showing high stress sensing power for a variety of conditions included in both the dataset used for biomarker identification (mean f1-score achieved at 0.99) and the independent datasets from different sources (mean f1-score achieved at 0.98). We discovered a significant correlation between stress sensing power and evaluation metrics such as the number of associated regulators in a B. subtilis gene regulatory network (GRN) and the number of associated modules in a B. subtilis co-expression network (CEN). GRNs and CENs provide information relevant to the diversity of biological processes encoded by biomarker genes. We demonstrate that quantitatively relating meaningful evaluation metrics with stress sensing power has potential for recognising biomarkers that show better sensitivity and robustness to an extended set of stress conditions. We conclude that this approach is readily applicable to biomarker discovery model selection.",

    "abstract": "Given an array of phenotypes (e.g., yield across strains and conditions), one can ask how to best choose subsets of conditions that are informative about the whole dataset, enabling efficient system identification and providing a basis vector in phenotype space. To that end, we introduce a mixed integer linear programming approach to choose explanatory and response variables for a phenotypic matrix. We applied the algorithm to a set of fitness measurements for 462 yeast strains under 38 carbon sources, and to the growth phenotypes of 65 marine bacteria on 11 media. The algorithm identifies environments that can be used as features to predict growth under other conditions, providing biologically interpretable metabolic axes for strain discrimination. Our approach could be used to reduce the number of experiments needed to identify a strain or to map its metabolic capabilities. The generality of the algorithm makes it appropriate for addressing subset selection problems in areas beyond biology.",

    "abstract": "Robust and accessible biomarkers that can capture the heterogeneity of Alzheimers disease and its diverse pathological processes are urgently needed. Here, we undertook an investigation of Alzheimers disease cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from the same subjects using three different proteomic platforms--SomaLogic SomaScan, Olink proximity extension assay, and tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry--to assess which protein markers in these two biofluids may serve as reliable biomarkers of AD pathophysiology observed from unbiased brain proteomics studies. Median correlation of overlapping protein measurements across platforms in CSF (r[~]0.7) and plasma (r[~]0.6) was good, with more variability in plasma. The SomaScan technology provided the most measurements in plasma. Surprisingly, many proteins altered in AD CSF were found to be altered in the opposite direction in plasma, including important members of AD brain co-expression modules. An exception was SMOC1, a key member of the brain matrisome module associated with amyloid-{beta} deposition in AD, which was found to be elevated in both CSF and plasma. Protein co-expression analysis on greater than 7000 protein measurements in CSF and 9500 protein measurements in plasma across all proteomic platforms revealed strong changes in modules related to autophagy, ubiquitination, and sugar metabolism in CSF, and endocytosis and the matrisome in plasma. Cross-platform and cross-biofluid proteomics represents a promising approach for AD biomarker development.",

    "abstract": "Social isolation is a profound form of psychological stress that impacts the mental health of a large proportion of society. Other experimental models of stress and injury have demonstrated microglia activation and alterations in neural activity. Microglia and neural activity undergo coordinated changes under physiological and pathological states. However, the effect of social isolation on microglia and neural activity has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we show that the dorsal medial hypothalamus and hippocampal CA2 region of male mice undergo an increased microglia volume and branching following social isolation, whereas females exhibit this increase in the hypothalamus only. The prefrontal cortex, central amygdala, nucleus accumbens shell, and visual cortex did not exhibit changes in microglia structure in either male or female mice. The home cage resting level of neural activity, as measured by the immediate early gene c-fos, was reduced in CA2 and the prefrontal cortex of female but not male mice following isolation. However, the co-variation in neural activity across brain regions was abolished in male but not female isolated mice. These data show that different brain regions undergo independent and dissociable changes in microglia structure and network activity following social isolation which may account for changes in cognition and behavior associated with this form of psychological stress.",

    "abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus is hypothesized to act as a pattern separator that distinguishes between similar input patterns during memory formation and retrieval. Sparse ensembles of DG cells associated with learning and memory, i.e. engrams, have been labeled and manipulated to recall novel context memories. Functional studies of DG cell activity have demonstrated the spatial specificity and stability of DG cells during navigation. To reconcile how the DG contributes to separating global context as well as individual navigational routes, we trained mice to perform a delayed-non-match-to-position (DNMP) T-maze task and tagged DG neurons during performance of this task on a novel T-maze. The following day, mice navigated a second environment: the same T-maze, the same T-maze with one route permanently blocked but still visible, or a novel open field. First, we found that novelty and memory demand yielded larger engram ensemble size. Additionally, the degree of engram reactivation across days differed based on the traversal of maze routes, such that mice traversing only one arm had higher overlap than chance but less overlap than mice running the full two-route task. These differences could not be fully explained by behavioral differences across groups on the second day. Together, these results support the hypothesis that DG contributes to spatial navigation memory and that partially non-overlapping ensembles encode different routes within the context of different environments.\n\nHighlightsO_LIImmediate-early-gene labeling strategy revealed spatial navigation ensembles in DG\nC_LIO_LIBoth novelty and memory demand contribute to recruited ensemble size\nC_LIO_LISub-ensembles encode separate maze routes within a larger task context\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Our continuous visual experience in daily life is dominated by change. Previous research has focused on the effects of visual motion, eye movements or the transition between events, but has failed to capture their full impact across the brain. Using intracranial recordings in humans, we investigate the neural responses to these sources of novelty during the natural experience of watching film. Responses to saccades and film cuts were much stronger than those to visual motion, extending far beyond traditional visual processing areas. Film cuts associated with semantic event boundaries elicit strong and specific responses in higher-order brain areas. Saccades associated with high visual novelty also elicit strong neural responses. Specific locations in higher-order brain areas show selectivity to either high or low-novelty saccade, as well as face or non-face targets. In summary, visual and semantic novelty drive much of the human brain, while exhibiting specialization to specific forms of novelty.\n\nTeaserWhen watching movies, the entire brain responds to film cuts, eye movements and motion, with stronger responses when something new happens.",

    "abstract": "Extracting regularities from ongoing stimulus streams to form predictions is crucial for adaptive behavior. Such regularities exist in terms of the content of the stimuli (i.e., \"what\" it is) and their timing (i.e., \"when\" it will occur), both of which are known to interactively modulate sensory processing. In real-world stimulus streams, regularities also occur contextually - e.g. predictions of individual notes vs. melodic contour in music. However, it is unknown whether the brain integrates predictions in a contextually congruent manner (e.g., if slower \"when\" predictions selectively interact with complex \"what\" predictions), and whether integrating predictions of simple vs. complex features rely on dissociable neural correlates. To address these questions, our study employed \"what\" and \"when\" violations at different levels - single tones (elements) vs. tone pairs (chunks) - within the same stimulus stream, while neural activity was recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG) in participants (N=20) performing a repetition detection task. Our results reveal that \"what\" and \"when\" predictions interactively modulated stimulus-evoked response amplitude in a contextually congruent manner, but that these modulations were shared between contexts in terms of the spatiotemporal distribution of EEG signals. Effective connectivity analysis using dynamic causal modeling showed that the integration of \"what\" and \"when\" prediction selectively increased connectivity at relatively late cortical processing stages, between the superior temporal gyrus and the fronto-parietal network. Taken together, these results suggest that the brain integrates different predictions with a high degree of contextual specificity, but in a shared and distributed cortical network.\n\nSignificance statementPredictions of stimulus features, present in different statistically-regular contexts in the environment, are crucial to forming adaptive behavior. However, it is unknown if the brain integrates predictions selectively according to such contextual differences. By recording human electroencephalography during experimental manipulations of time-based and content-based predictions, we found that those predictions interactively modulated neural activity in a contextually congruent manner, such that local (vs. global) time-based predictions modulated content-based predictions of sequence elements (vs. chunks). These modulations were shared between contextual levels in terms of the spatiotemporal distribution of neural activity. This suggests that the brain integrates different predictions with a high degree of contextual specificity, but in a shared and distributed cortical network.",

    "abstract": "Pain therapies targeting the cannabinoid system are increasing with expansion of cannabis legalization but adaptations in the endogenous cannabinoid system during inflammatory pain could limit their efficacy. Presynaptic inhibition of GABA release mediated by cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) agonists in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is markedly reduced in male and female Sprague Dawley rats after persistent inflammation induced by Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA). Inflammation results in increased endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis and desensitization of presynaptic CB1Rs that is reversed by a GRK2/3 inhibitor, Compound 101. Despite CB1R desensitization, eCB activation of CB1Rs is maintained after inflammation. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) in naive animals is rapid and transient, but is prolonged in recordings after inflammation. Prolonged DSI is mediated by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) indicating reduced monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) activity. These adaptations within the endogenous cannabinoid system have important implications for the development of future pain therapies targeting CB1Rs or MAGL.",

To date, however, most studies of neuronal function in C. elegans are incapable of performing microscopy imaging with subcellular resolution and behavior analysis in the same set of animals. This constraint stems from the immobilization requirement for high-resolution imaging that is incompatible with behavioral analysis. In particular, conventional immobilization methods often lead to either irreversible, partial, or slowly reversible immobilization of animals preventing a multiplexed approach. Here, we present a novel microfluidic device that uses surface acoustic waves (SAW) as a non-contact method to temporarily immobilize worms for a short period (40 seconds). This device allows non-invasive analysis of swimming behavior and high-resolution synaptic imaging in the same animal. In addition, because of the low impact of this SAW approach, the device enables fast, repeated imaging of single neurons and behavior in the same animals for three to four days. We anticipate that this device will enable longitudinal analysis of animal motility and subcellular morphological changes during development and ageing in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "The sequencing of the antibody repertoire (Rep-seq) revolutionized the diversity of antigen B cell receptor studies, allowing deep and quantitative analysis to decipher the role of adaptive immunity in health and disease. Particularly, horse (Equus caballus) polyclonal antibodies have been produced and used since the century XIX to treat and prophylaxis of diphtheria, tuberculosis, tetanus, pneumonia, and, more recently, COVID-19. However, our knowledge about the horse B cell receptors repertories is minimal. We present a deep horse antibody heavy chain repertoire (IGH) characterization of non-immunized horses using HTS technology. In this study, we obtained a mean of 248,169 unique IgM clones and 66,141 unique IgG clones from four domestic adult horses. Rarefaction analysis showed sequence coverage was between 52 and 82% in IgM and IgG isotypes. We observed that besides horses antibody can use all of the functional IGHV genes, around 80% of their antibodies use only three IGHV gene segments, and around 55% use only one IGHJ gene segment. This limited VJ diversity seems to be compensated by the junctional diversity of these antibodies. We observed that the junctional diversity in horses antibodies is highly frequent, present in more than 90% of horse antibodies. Besides this, the length of this region seems to be higher in horse antibodies than in other species. N1 and N2 nucleotides addition range from 0 to 111 nucleotides. In addition, around 45% of the antibody clones have more than ten nucleotides in both N1 and N2 junction regions. This diversity mechanism may be one of the most important in providing variability to the equine antibody repertoire. This study provides new insights regarding horse antibody composition, diversity generation, and particularities compared to other species, such as the frequency and length of N nucleotide addition. This study also points out the urgent need to better characterize TdT in horses and in other species to better understand antibody repertoire characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Changing sea temperatures and primary productivity are rapidly altering marine ecosystems, but with considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the relative importance of these drivers and how their interactions may affect fisheries yield through complex food webs. Such outcomes are more difficult to predict for shallow coastal ecosystems than those in pelagic and shelf habitats, because coastal food webs are fuelled by a combination of separate pelagic and benthic energy pathways. Using long-term, empirical field data, we developed a novel multispecies size spectrum model for shallow coastal reefs. We include size-structured benthic and pelagic resources and trophic structures, allowing us to explore potential climate change scenarios that involve varying combinations of warming with changes in benthic and pelagic resources. Our model predicts that changes in resource levels will have much stronger impacts on fish biomass and yields than changes driven by physiological responses to temperature. Under increased plankton abundance, species in all trophic groups were predicted to increase in biomass, average size and yields. By contrast, changes in benthic resource produced variable responses across coastal trophic groups. Increased benthic resource led to increasing benthivorous and piscivorous fish biomass, yields and mean body sizes, but decreases in herbivores and planktivores. When resource changes were combined with warming seas, physiological responses generally decreased species biomass and yields. Our results suggest that the source, size and abundance of primary and secondary producers are critical to understanding impacts of warming seas on coastal fish communities. Understanding changes in benthic production and its implications for coastal fisheries requires urgent attention. Our modified size spectrum model provides a framework for further study of benthic and pelagic energy pathways that can be easily adapted to other ecosystems.",

To address this knowledge gap, we explored metagenomes from 25 lakes from the arctic and boreal zone and one tropical reservoir with the aim of describing the community structure of fungi and fungi-like organisms (Oomycota). A second objective was to identify possible environmental factors influencing the composition of the fungal communities. Our results show that the main fungal phyla and orders are the same across all the lakes despite the differences in geographic location and prevailing climate. Still, there was differential distribution of more highly resolved taxa across the lakes that accordingly featured distinct communities, possibly caused by differential availability of carbon substrates in the lakes. A more detailed classification of sequences related to the pathogenic Oomycota genus Phytophthora clearly demonstrated that while technologies now exist for sequencing entire microbial communities in great detail, we are still severely limited by insufficient coverage of eukaryotic sequences and genomes in public databases.",

Here, we report a base editing approach in which adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated adenine base editor (ABE) delivery to postmitotic photoreceptors is used to correct the Pde6b mutation in a retinal degeneration 10 (rd10) mouse model of RP. Subretinal delivery of AAV8-ABE corrects Pde6b mutation with up to 37.41% efficiency at the DNA level and up to 91.95% efficiency at the cDNA level, restores PDE6B expression, preserves photoreceptors and rescues visual function.

    "abstract": "Variants within the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) can disrupt organelle function and lead to severe multi-system disease. The wide range of disease manifestations observed in heteroplasmic patients results from varying fractions of abnormal mtDNA molecules in different cells and tissues. Here, we profiled the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility state, and heteroplasmy of the most common pathogenic mitochondrial mutation, m.3243A>G, in single cells isolated from the retina and choroid of a patient with retinal and systemic disease. We found that the proportion of the pathogenic m.3243G allele was neither evenly nor randomly distributed across ocular cell types. All classes of cells in the neural retinal exhibited a high percentage of the mutant variant. However, endothelial and lymphocyte populations of the choroid were almost homoplasmic for the wildtype allele. Gene expression analysis revealed that the presence of m.3243G causes upregulation of MTRNR2L1, a pseudogene of humanin, known to be protective against oxidative damage. We further found by joint multimodal sequencing of the retinal pigment epithelium that a high proportion of the 3243G variant was associated with transcriptionally and morphologically abnormal cells. Together, these findings show the non-random nature of mitochondrial variant partitioning and demonstrate that m.3243A>G causes non-cell autonomous dysfunction in the eye.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARYTranscriptome and ATAC sequencing in single cells from a human donor with MELAS show that m.3243A>G variant segregation follows a cell type-specific pattern.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496449v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3e9e4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b2579org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c93099org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@959150_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Animals are under constant selective pressure from a myriad of diverse pathogens. Microsporidia are ubiquitous animal parasites, but the influence they exert on shaping animal genomes is mostly unknown. Using multiplexed competition assays, we measured the impact of four different species of microsporidia on 22 wild isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans. This resulted in the identification of 13 strains with altered resistance or sensitivity to infection. One of these identified strains, JU1400, is sensitive to an epidermal-infecting species by lacking tolerance to infection. JU1400 is also resistant to an intestinal-infecting species and can specifically recognize and destroy this pathogen. Genetic mapping of JU1400 demonstrates that these two opposing phenotypes are caused by separate alleles. Transcriptional analysis reveals that this lack of tolerance in JU1400 results in a response that shares similarity to that induced by toxins. In contrast, we do not observe JU1400 resistance being regulated at the transcriptional level. The transcriptional response to these four microsporidia species is conserved, with C. elegans strain-specific differences in potential immune genes. Together, our results show that phenotypic differences to microsporidia infection amongst C. elegans are common and that animals can evolve species-specific genetic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the pathological impact of non-coding genetic variation is a major challenge in medical genetics. Accumulating evidences indicate that a significant fraction of genetic alterations, including structural variants (SVs), can cause human disease by altering the function of non-coding regulatory elements, such as enhancers. In the case of SVs, described pathomechanisms include changes in enhancer dosage and long-range enhancer-gene communication. However, there is still a clear gap between the need to predict and interpret the medical impact of non-coding variants, and the existence of tools to properly perform these tasks. To reduce this gap, we have developed POSTRE (Prediction Of STRuctural variant Effects), a computational tool to predict the pathogenicity of SVs implicated in a broad range of human congenital disorders. By considering disease-relevant cellular contexts, POSTRE identifies SVs with either coding or long-range pathological consequences with high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, POSTRE not only identifies pathogenic SVs, but also predicts the disease-causative genes and the underlying pathological mechanism (e.g, gene deletion, enhancer disconnection, enhancer adoption, etc.).

    "abstract": "Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are a chemically diverse class of insecticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Many OPs require bioactivation to their active oxon form via cytochrome P450 to effectively inhibit AChE. OP toxicity can be mitigated by detoxification reactions performed by carboxylesterase and paraoxonase. The relative extent of bioactivation to detoxification varies among individuals and between species, leading to differential susceptibility to OP toxicity. Because of these species differences, it is imperative to characterize OP metabolism in model systems used to assess OP toxicity to adequately evaluate potential human hazard. We have shown that the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica is a suitable model to assess OP neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity via rapid, automated testing of adult and developing organisms in parallel using morphological and behavioral endpoints. D. japonica has two cholinesterase enzymes with intermediate properties between AChE and butyrylcholinesterase that are sensitive to OP inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that this planarian contains the major OP metabolic machinery to be a relevant model for OP neurotoxicity studies. Adult and regenerating D. japonica can bioactivate chlorpyrifos and diazinon into their respective oxons. Significant AChE inhibition was only observed after in vivo metabolic activation but not when the parent OPs were directly added to planarian homogenate. Additionally, we found that D. japonica has both carboxylesterase and paraoxonase activity. Using specific chemical inhibitors, we show that carboxylesterase activity is distinct from cholinesterase activity. Taken together, these results further support the use of D. japonica for OP toxicity studies.",

In non-human primates, combined fMRI and electrophysiological recordings have not disentangle the contributions of spiking activity to the neurovascular response. Here, we combined functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and recording of single-unit activities (SUA) in visual and fronto-medial cortices of behaving macaques. We computed task-induced and SUA-induced CBV activation maps. We demonstrate that SUA provides a significant estimate of the neurovascular response below the typical fMRI voxel spatial resolution of 2mm3. Furthermore, our results also show that single unit and CBV activities are statistically uncorrelated during the resting states but correlate during behaving tasks. Conversely, during the resting states, CBV activities across known connected brain areas are correlated but decorrelate at the onset of the tasks as expected if participating in the default mode network (DMN). These results have important implications for interpreting functional imaging findings collected with fMRI or fUS while one constructs inferences of spiking activities during resting-state or while primates perform tasks.",

    "abstract": "Learning a predictive cue of a threat - threat conditioning - allows us to prevent direct contact with the threat. In animals, threat-conditioned cues induce fear-like body movements such as freezing. Interestingly, training animals with alternative bodily defenses to avoid harm could reduce conditioned fear-like responses, suggesting that the physical capacity to actively defend against a threat could help overcome passively induced fear. However, evidence for the role of body movements in acquisition and alleviation of human fear is scarce. In the present study, human participants showed a deviation of multidimensional body movement patterns as threat conditioning progressed in a naturalistic virtual setting. The subsequent training to exert defensive body movements to prevent harm weakened the conditioned body movements and resulted in a long-term (24 hrs) reduction of the physiological responses and subjective fear toward the conditioned cues. Unlike the passive extinction procedure, the training of defensive body movements was resistant to spontaneous recovery of a fear response. The alleviating effect of the active defense training was observed when participants physically defended themselves but not when they merely observed another person vicariously defending against a threat on their behalf. These results suggest the critical role of body movements in both acquisition and reduction of conditioned fear among humans. Further investigations may leverage more embodied procedures to advance mechanistic understandings and clinical interventions of human fear memories.",

    "abstract": "Corticostriatal projections form the input level of a circuitry that connects the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Three distinct, functional subcircuits exist according to the tripartite model: Sensorimotor cortices projecting mainly to the dorsolateral striatum; associative cortices projecting to the dorsomedial striatum and limbic cortices projecting to the ventral striatum. However, there is to date no atlas that allows researchers to label cortical projection areas belonging to each of these subcircuits separately.\n\nTo address this research gap, the aim of this study was threefold: First, to systematically review anatomical tracing studies that focused on corticostriatal projections in non-human primates, and to classify their findings according to the tripartite model. Second, to develop an atlas of the human cerebral cortex based on this classification. Third, to test the hypothesis that labels in this atlas show structural connectivity with specific striatal subregions in humans using diffusion-based tractography in a sample of 24 healthy participants.\n\nIn total, 98 studies met the inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Information about projections from the cortex to the striatum was systematically extracted by Brodmann area, and cortical areas were classified by their dominant efferent projections. Taking known homological and functional similarities and differences between non-human primate and human cortical regions into account, a new human corticostriatal projection (CSP) atlas was developed. Using human diffusion-based tractography analyses, we found that the limbic and sensorimotor atlas labels showed preferential structural connectivity with the ventral and dorsolateral striatum, respectively. However, the pattern of structural connectivity for the associative label showed the greatest degree of overlap with other labels.\n\nWe provide this new atlas as a freely available tool for neuroimaging studies, where it allows for the first-time delineation of anatomically informed regions-of-interest to study functional subcircuits within the corticostriatal circuitry. This tool will enable specific investigations of subcircuits involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.\n\nHighlights- Systematic review of anatomical projections from the cerebral cortex to the striatum in non-human primates.\n- Development of a novel cortical atlas for use in neuroimaging studies focusing on the corticostriatal brain circuitry.\n- Tractography in human diffusion-weighted imaging data to test if associative, limbic, and sensorimotor cortical atlas labels show preferential connectivity to regions within the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies described 2-4 Hz oscillations in the hippocampus of rats performing stationary locomotion on treadmills and other apparatus. Since the 2-4 Hz rhythm shares common features with hippocampal theta (5-12 Hz) oscillations - such as a positive running speed-amplitude relationship and modulation of spiking activity - many have questioned whether these rhythms are related or independently generated. To answer this question, we analyzed local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity from the dorsal CA1 of rats executing a spatial alternation task and running for [~]15 s in a wheel during the intertrial intervals both before and after muscimol injection into the medial septum. We observed 4-Hz oscillations during wheel runs, but not during maze runs. The 4-Hz amplitude positively correlated with wheel speed and negatively with maze speed. Also, the amplitude of 4-Hz and theta oscillations were inversely related. Medial septum inactivation abolished hippocampal theta but preserved 4-Hz oscillations.

    "abstract": "Striatal dopamine released from the axons of midbrain dopamine neurons has been linked to a wide range of functions, including movement control and reward-based learning. Recent studies have reported functional signaling differences between axons and somas of dopamine neurons, suggesting that local modulation controls dopamine release and calling into question the classical view of somatic control. However, these experiments are technically challenging, making it difficult to ensure that axonal and somatic recordings come from the same neurons, particularly given the heterogeneity of dopaminergic cell types. Here we used genetic strategies to isolate key dopaminergic neuron subtypes and monitor their axonal and somatic signaling patterns in behaving mice. Contrary to the inferences drawn from previous studies, these experiments revealed a robust correlation between somatic and axonal signaling. Thus, by exploiting a previously unknown connection between genetic and functional diversity in dopamine neurons, we establish that subtypes must be considered to understand the mechanisms of dopamine release in striatum during behavior.",

    "abstract": "Animal development is a complex yet robust process that can withstand lengthy and variable interruptions. In Caenorhabditis elegans, adverse conditions can trigger entry into dauer, a stress-resistant, developmentally arrested diapause stage that occurs midway through larval development. Favorable conditions promote recovery from dauer, and post-dauer larvae develop normally. During larval development, epidermal seam cells are multipotent and divide at each stage. At adulthood, seam cells differentiate and express the adult-specific COL-19 collagen. The progression of cell fates is controlled by a network of genes called the heterochronic pathway, including the LIN-29 transcription factor that directly activates col-19 expression, and the let-7 microRNA that indirectly promotes lin-29 expression. Notably, most known heterochronic genes that oppose adult cell fate act only during continuous development; these genes are dispensable after dauer. We performed a genetic screen for heterochronic genes that act after dauer and identified ztf-16, encoding a zinc finger transcription factor in the hunchback/Ikaros-like family. We found that ztf-16 is required to prevent precocious expression of the adult cell fate marker col-19p::gfp equally during both life histories, making ztf-16(-) the first precocious heterochronic mutant to be unaffected by dauer. Our data indicate that ztf-16 regulates col-19p::gfp via a novel, lin-29-independent mechanism. Endogenous ztf-16b::gfp expression is regulated by let-7 and ztf-16 acts genetically downstream of let-7, but lin-29 is not required for col-19p::gfp expression in ztf-16 mutant larvae or adults. Finally, mRNA-seq experiments identified genes whose expression is regulated by ztf-16 in each life history. Taken together, this work illuminates a novel aspect of the heterochronic pathway relevant to both dauer and non-dauer development.",

    "abstract": "An abundant literature reports on  sequential effects observed when humans make predictions on the basis of stochastic sequences of stimuli. Such sequential effects represent departures from an optimal, Bayesian process. A prominent explanation posits that humans are adapted to changing environments, and erroneously assume non-stationarity of the environment, even if the latter is static. As a result, their predictions fluctuate over time. We propose a different explanation in which sub-optimal and fluctuating predictions result from cognitive constraints (or costs), under which humans however behave rationally. We devise a framework of costly inference, in which we develop two classes of models that differ by the nature of the constraints at play: in one case the precision of beliefs comes at a cost, while in the other beliefs with high predictive power are favored. To compare model predictions to human behavior, we carry out a prediction task that uses binary random stimuli, with probabilities ranging from .05 to .95. Although in this task the environment is static and the Bayesian belief converges, subjects predictions fluctuate and are biased toward the recent stimulus history. Both classes of models capture this  attractive effect, but they depart in their characterization of higher-order effects. Only the precision-cost model reproduces a  repulsive effect, observed in the data, in which predictions are biased away from stimuli presented in the more distant past. Our experimental results reveal systematic modulations in sequential effects, which our theoretical approach accounts for in terms of rationality under cognitive constraints.",

    "abstract": "Recent attempts to explain the evolutionary prevalence of same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) have focused on the role of indiscriminate mating. However, in many cases, SSB involves plastically adjusting sex roles to achieve successful courtship or pairing. To evaluate this overlooked factor, we tested whether ancestral sex-role plasticity facilitated the evolution of SSB in the termite Reticulitermes speratus. Male termites follow females in paired  tandems before mating, and movement patterns are sexually dimorphic. Adaptive same-sex tandems occur in both sexes. We show that in such cases, one partner adopts the other sexs movement patterns, resulting in behavioural dimorphism. Data-based simulations confirmed that this socially-cued plasticity contributes to pair maintenance because dimorphic movements improve reunion success upon accidental separation. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the ancestors of modern termites lack consistent sex roles during pairing, indicating that R. speratus inherited the plasticity from the ancestor. Socio-environmental induction of ancestral behavioural potential may be of widespread importance to the evolutionary maintenance of SSB.",

    "abstract": "Carcinogenesis is an evolutionary process fueled by the interplay of somatic mutations and the local microenvironment. In recent years, hundreds of cancer related genes have been discovered using cancer cohorts. However, these cohorts are heterogenous mixtures of different molecular phenotypes, which hampers the identification of driver genes associated to a specific cancer hallmark or microenvironment. Here, we compared the landscape of positively selected somatic mutations in immune-escaped (escape+) versus non-escaped (escape-) tumors. We applied the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) to 9896 individuals from 31 primary tumor tissues from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) separated by escape status. Altogether, we found 85 driver genes, including 27 and 16 novel driver genes in escape- and escape+ tumors, respectively. Overall, driver dN/dS of escape+ tumors (dN/dS=1.23) was significantly lower and closer to neutrality than driver dN/dS of escape-tumors (dN/dS=1.62), suggesting a relaxation of positive selection in driver genes, a relaxation of negative selection on immunogenic driver sites, or a combination of both fueled by immune escape. We also found that the proportion of unique sites mutated in escape+ tumors is almost double than in escape-tumors, and that immune evasion allows for a more diverse repertoire of mutational signatures. We also identified that strong immunoediting in the absence of escape leads to a better overall survival in tumors enriched by an inflamed phenotype. Ultimately, our findings reveal differences in the evolutionary strategies used by cancer cells to establish tumorigenesis and highlight the need for better patient stratification to develop tailored treatments based on molecular targets.",

Though targeted RNA engineering has become feasible with the discovery and engineering of the CRISPR-Cas13 system, simultaneous modulation of different RNA processing steps remains unavailable. In addition, off-target events resulting from effectors fused with dCas13 limit its application. Here we developed a novel platform, Combinatorial RNA Engineering via Scaffold Tagged gRNA (CREST), which can simultaneously execute multiple RNA modulation functions on different RNA targets. In CREST, RNA scaffolds are appended to the 3 end of Cas13 gRNA and their cognate RNA binding proteins are fused with enzymatic domains for manipulation. We show that CREST is capable of simultaneously manipulating RNA alternative splicing and A-to-G or C-to-U base editing. Furthermore, by fusing two split fragments of the deaminase domain of ADAR2 to dCas13 and PUFc respectively, we reconstituted its enzyme activity at target sites. This split design can reduce more than 90% of off-target events otherwise induced by a full-length effector. The flexibility of the CREST framework will enrich the transcriptome engineering toolbox for the study of RNA biology and the development of RNA-focused therapeutics.",

Despite these efforts, and due to morphological similarities between B. zonata and other pests in relevant developmental stages, the monitoring process is challenging, time-consuming, and requires external assistance from professional labs.

    "abstract": "Soil microorganisms have adapted to compete and exploit different metabolic niches in their physically and chemically diverse environment via evolution and acquisition of distinct physiological and biochemical traits. As the interface for most carbon and nutrient exchange between plants and microorganisms, the rhizosphere has received substantial attention. By comparison, what is commonly termed bulk-soil (soil free of living roots) represents a far greater volume and surface area throughout the season, and substantially higher taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity; the traits and activity of its inhabitants may also have a significant impact on overall soil function. We used a combination of comparative genomics and exoproteomics to identify metabolic traits of bacteria adapted to life in bulk soil and compared these with traits of bacteria living in the rhizosphere of wild oat, Avena barbata. In bulk soil bacteria, we observed: (i) greater investment in extracellular polymer-degrading enzyme production; (ii) greater potential for secretion (presence of signal peptides) of polymer-degrading enzymes; (iii) production of accessory proteins (carbohydrate binding modules) fused with glycoside hydrolases that enhance substrate affinity, stabilize, and increase reaction rates of polymer degrading enzymes; and (iv) organization of polymer degradation machinery within gene clusters that facilitate co-transcription of enzymes, transcription factors and transporters for polymer depolymerization products. Together, these findings suggest that unlike rhizosphere-adapted bacteria--which specialize on small molecules released primarily as root exudates--bulk soil-adapted bacteria have evolved to exploit plant polymers. This biochemically costly strategy may be mitigated by protein-level adaptations that enhance the efficiency of extracellular enzyme-mediated substrate acquisition.\n\nIMPORTANCEPlant-soil-microbe interactions are dynamic and complex, with significant implications for ecosystem functioning. Microbial traits, such as nutrient acquisition and growth yield, combined with soil and climate parameters, impact major biogeochemical processes and can define the future fate of soil carbon. Diverse soil microorganisms occupy different physical habitats within soil and exploit distinct niches by expressing different metabolic traits. Identifying and quantifying traits that underlie their fitness and function is key for understanding and predicting how soil carbon transformation and stabilization will change in the future or can be managed through intervention.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria rely on CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) that depend on {approx}15 genes to produce two protein complexes: an inorganic carbon (Ci) transporter and a 100+ nm carboxysome compartment that encapsulates rubisco with a carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme. Mutations disrupting CCM components prohibit growth in todays atmosphere (0.04% CO2), indicating that CCMs evolved to cope with declining environmental CO2. Indeed, geochemical data and models indicate that atmospheric CO2 has been generally decreasing from high concentrations over the last {approx}3.5 billion years. We used a synthetic reconstitution of a bacterial CCM in E. coli to study the co-evolution of CCMs with atmospheric CO2. We constructed strains expressing putative ancestors of modern CCMs -- strains lacking one or more CCM components -- and evaluated their growth in a variety of CO2 concentrations. Partial forms expressing CA or Ci uptake genes grew better than controls in intermediate CO2 levels ({approx}1%); we observed similar phenotypes in genetic studies of two autotrophic bacteria, H. neapolitanus and C. necator. To explain how partial CCMs improve growth, we advance a model of co-limitation of autotrophic growth by CO2 and HCO3-, as both are required to produce biomass. Our model and results delineated a viable trajectory for bacterial CCM evolution where decreasing atmospheric CO2 induces an HCO3- deficiency that is alleviated by acquisition of CAs or Ci uptake genes, thereby enabling the emergence of a modern CCM. This work underscores the importance of considering physiology and environmental context when studying the evolution of biological complexity.\n\nSignificanceThe greenhouse gas content of the ancient atmosphere is estimated using models and measurements of geochemical proxies. Some inferred high ancient CO2 levels using models of biological CO2 fixation to interpret the C isotopes found in preserved organic matter. Others argued that elevated CO2 could reconcile a faint young Sun with evidence for liquid water on Earth. We took a complementary \"synthetic biological\" approach to understanding the composition of the ancient atmosphere by studying present-day bacteria engineered to resemble ancient autotrophs. By showing that it is simpler to rationalize the emergence of modern bacterial autotrophs if CO2 was once high, these investigations provided independent evidence for the view that CO2 concentrations were significantly elevated in the atmosphere of early Earth.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria use specialized type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) to secrete proteins across their diderm cell envelope. One of the T7SS subtypes, named ESX-1, is a major virulence determinant in pathogenic species such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum. ESX-1 secretes a variety of substrates, called Esx, PE, PPE and Esp proteins, at least some of which as folded heterodimers. Investigations into the functions of these substrates is problematic, because of the intricate network of co-dependent secretion between several ESX-1 substrates. Here, we describe that the ESX-1 substrate PPE68 is essential for secretion of the highly immunogenic substrate EsxA and EspE via the ESX-1 system in M. marinum. While secreted PPE68 is processed on the cell surface, the majority of cell-associated PPE68 of M. marinum and M. tuberculosis is present in a cytosolic complex with its PE partner and the EspG1 chaperone. Interfering with the binding of EspG1 to PPE68 blocked its export and the secretion of EsxA and EspE. In contrast, esxA is not required for the secretion of PPE68, revealing hierarchy in co-dependent secretion. Remarkably, the final ten residues of PPE68, a negatively charged domain, seem essential for EspE secretion, but not for the secretion of EsxA and PPE68 itself. This indicates that distinctive domains of PPE68 are involved in secretion of the different ESX-1 substrates. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanistic model for the central role of PPE68 in ESX-1 mediated secretion and substrate co-dependence.\n\nImportanceMycobacterium tuberculosis use type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) to secrete proteins across its uniquely hydrophobic diderm cell envelope. A T7SS subtype, called ESX-1, is one of its most important virulence determinants by mediating intracellular survival through phagosomal rupture and subsequent translocation of the mycobacterium to the host cytosol. Identifying the ESX-1 substrate that is responsible for this process is problematic because of the intricate network of co-dependent secretion between ESX-1 substrates. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the central role of the ESX-1 substrate PPE68 for the secretion of ESX-1 substrates, using the model organism Mycobacterium marinum. Unravelling the mechanism of co-dependent secretion will aid the functional understanding of T7SSs and will allow the analysis of the individual roles of ESX-1 substrates in the virulence caused by this significant human pathogen.",

Through the Manhattan plots, 11 fungal genera were found to show a decreasing trend throughout the sugarcane growth period, and two fungal genera were significantly enriched at three stages of sugarcane growth (p < 0.05) including Pseudallescheria and Nectriaceae. In addition, soil pH, soil temperature (Tem), total nitrogen (TN) and total potassium (TP) were important drivers of fungal community structure at different stages of sugarcane growth. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) found that sugarcane disease status showed a significant and strong negative effect with selected soil properties, suggesting that poor soil may increase the likelihood of sugarcane disease. In addition changes in sugarcane rhizosphere community structure over time were mainly influenced by stochastic factors, but the contribution decreased to the lowest value after the sugarcane root adaptation system was stabilized (Maturity).\n\nIMPORTANCERhizosphere microbes are closely related to plant growth, and more studies have shown that the rhizosphere fungal microbial community has an important influence on plant health and growth status. However, little is known about the response of the rhizosphere fungal community to plant growth during the critical plant reproductive period. In this study, we analyzed the important response of the rhizosphere fungal community of sugarcane through the pattern of abundance changes in its critical growth nodes by various methods to investigate the subtle changes in the assembly of the rhizosphere fungal community with the growth of sugarcane. Our work provides innovative ideas for the prevention of soil-borne diseases in plants and also provides a solid basis for the development of microbial models of crops rhizosphere soil.",

    "abstract": "Whether the human placenta is a sterile organ is under debate. Yet, infection of the amniotic cavity, including the placenta, is causally linked to preterm birth. This study compares the bacterial profiles of term and preterm placentas through culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the amnion, amnion-chorion interface, subchorion, villous tree, and basal plate, while accounting for patient identity, mode of delivery, presence/absence of labor, and potential background DNA contamination. As no evidence of a placental microbiota in term pregnancy was found, these placentas were considered as controls. Placentas from preterm birth cases were more likely to yield bacterial cultures, and their bacterial DNA profiles were less rich than those of term controls, suggesting the predominance of only a few bacteria. Nevertheless, the bacterial DNA profiles of placentas from preterm cases and term controls were not consistently different. The placentas from preterm cases may often have a microbiota but the bacteria constituting these communities varied among the women. Mode of delivery had a pronounced effect on the bacterial profiles of all sampled levels of the placenta. Specifically, the bacterial DNA profiles of vaginally delivered placentas had higher relative abundances of Finegoldia, Gardnerella, Peptoniphilus, and Prevotella (each a common resident of the vaginal microbiota) than the profiles of cesarean-delivered placentas. Collectively, these data indicate that there is a not a placental microbiota in normal term pregnancy, and that although the placentas of some preterm cases were populated by bacteria, the identities of these bacteria varied among women delivering preterm.\n\nIMPORTANCEIf a placental microbiota exists, then current understanding of the roles of microorganisms in pregnancy outcomes need to be reconsidered. For instance, we will need to determine if a placental microbiota is beneficial to pregnancy outcome by excluding potential pathogens from colonizing the placenta and/or effectively priming the fetal immune system, and furthermore which characteristics of the placental microbiota preclude versus promote placental infection, which can result in pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Our findings here are consistent with prior investigations that have reported that there is not a placental microbiota in typical human pregnancies. Yet, bacteria can be detected in placentas from preterm deliveries. The principal source of microorganisms invading the amniotic cavity, including the placenta, is the vaginal microbiota. Focus should be on elucidating the metabolic and/or virulence characteristics of the subset of bacteria within the vaginal microbiota that commonly invade the amniotic cavity, resulting in infection.",

    "abstract": "Hydrocarbons (HCs) are organic compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. They mainly accumulate in oil reservoirs, but aromatic HCs can also have other sources and are widely distributed in the biosphere. Our perception of pathways for biotic degradation of major HCs and genetic information of key enzymes in these bioconversion processes have mainly been based on cultured microbes and are biased by uneven taxonomic representation. Here we use Annotree to provide a gene-centric view of aerobic degradation of aliphatic and aromatic HCs in a total of 23446 genomes from 123 bacterial and 14 archaeal phyla. Apart from the widespread genetic potential for HC degradation in Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes, genomes from an additional 18 bacterial and 3 archaeal phyla also hosted key HC degrading enzymes. Among these, such degradation potential has not been previously reported for representatives in the phyla UBA8248, Tectomicrobia, SAR324, and Eremiobacterota. While genomes containing full pathways for complete degradation of HCs were only detected in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota, other lineages capable of mediating such key steps could partner with representatives with truncated HC degradation pathways and collaboratively drive the process. Phylogeny reconstruction shows that the reservoir of key aerobic hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes in Bacteria and Archaea undergoes extensive diversification via gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer. This diversification could potentially enable microbes to rapidly adapt to novel and manufactured HCs that reach the environment.",

    "abstract": "Microplastic (MP) pollution is an environmental burden. MP enters food webs via ingestion by macrofauna, including isopods (Porcellio scaber) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, MP-effects on the host and its gut microbiome are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that biodegradable (polylactic acid, PLA) and non-biodegradable (polyethylene terephthalate, PET; polystyrene, PS) MP have contrasting effects on P. scaber mediated by changes of the associated gut microbiome. Although the isopods avoided food containing PS, isopod fitness after eight-week MP-exposure was unaffected. Qualitative and quantitative 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA analyses of gut microbiomes indicated general MP effects, MP-type specific indicator taxa, and stimulation by PLA compared to MP-free controls. Isopods emitted hydrogen, and its production increased and decreased after PLA-food and PET- or PS-food ingestion, respectively, relative to controls as indicated by microsensor measurements. Gut pH was unaffected by MP. We identified the gut of P. scaber as significant mobile source of reductant for soil microbiomes likely due to Enterobacteriaceae related fermentation activities that were stimulated by lactate generated during PLA-degradation. The findings suggest negative effects of PET and PS on gut fermentation, modulation of isopod hydrogen emissions by MP pollution, and the potential of MP to affect terrestrial food webs.",

The soil bacterial communities in the rhizosphere are highly important for maintaining soil productivity. However, the composition and structure of soil bacterial communities in the rotations of vegetable crops remain unclear. In this study, we explored the bacterial diversity and community structure of the tomato rhizosphere, including enzyme activities, yield, and fruit quality, under three different cropping systems: tomato-tomato continuous cropping (TY1), eggplant-tomato (S. melongena) rotation (TY2) and arrowhead-tomato (Sagittaria trifolia-Solanum lycopersicum) rotation (TY3). The composition and diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial communities differed significantly. The diversity was more in the TY2 and TY3 treatments than those in the TY1 treatment. Chujaibacter and Rhodanobacter were two predominant and unique strains detected only in TY1, while the relative abundances of Curvibacter and Luteimonas were the highest in TY2 and TY3, respectively. Moreover, Lysobacterium was a relatively abundant type of biocontrol bacterium found only in the TY3 treatment, which could contribute to alleviating the obstacle of tomato continuous cropping. Compared with the TY1 treatment, the activities of catalase were significantly higher in the TY2 and TY3 treatments. In addition, compared with TY1, the TY2 and TY3 plots increased the following parameters: tomato yields by 24-46%, total soluble solids by 37-93%, total organic acid by 10-15.7% and soluble protein by 10-21%, while the content of nitrate was significantly reduced by 23%. Altogether, compared with the tomato monoculture, the rotations of tomato with eggplant and arrowhead shifted the rhizosphere bacterial communities and improved the yield and quality of the vegetables. Moreover, a tomato rotation, particularly with arrowhead, was an effective way to alleviate the obstacles of continuous cropping.",

Despite the apparent core role that species such as Entodinium caudatum exert, their major biological and metabolic contributions to rumen function remain largely undescribed. Here, we have leveraged (meta)genome-centric metaproteomes from rumen fluid samples originating from both cattle and goats fed diets with varying inclusion levels of lipids and starch, to detail the specific metabolic niches that E. caudatum occupies in the context of its microbial co-habitants. Initial proteome estimations via total protein counts and label-free quantification highlight that E. caudatum comprises an extensive fraction of the total rumen metaproteome. Our analysis also suggested increased microbial predation and volatile fatty acid (VFA) metabolism by E. caudatum to occur in high methane-emitting animals, although with no apparent direct metabolic link to methanogenesis. Despite E. caudatum having a well-established reputation for digesting starch, it was unexpectedly less detectable in low methane emitting-animals fed high starch diets, which were instead dominated by propionate/succinate-producing bacterial populations suspected of being resistant to predation irrespective of host. Finally, we reaffirmed our abovementioned observations in geographically independent datasets, thus illuminating the substantial metabolic influence that under-explored eukaryotic populations have in the rumen, with greater implications for both digestion and methane metabolism.",

This study reconstructed 1677 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from metagenomic sequencing. The copresent microbiome containing 298 MAGs were found in metagenomic data of these contents and previous ruminal representative samples. These copresent MAGs were overrepresented in decomposing various substrates, especially pectin and xylan. Additionally, the SCFAs productions in RUSITEC were linked with copresent MAGs. Copresent MAGs obtained from this study shows promise to point out the direction for further research on in vitro ruminal fermentation, and enables a better understanding of rumen microbiotal structures and functions under in vitro condition.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/497131v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@310c66org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@251334org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fdfecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@363d8f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Overall, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidota dominated the general bacterial communities. Almost all individuals hosted bacteria of the genus Granulosicoccus, accounting for 12% of the total sequences, and eight additional core genera were identified.

    "abstract": "Gut microbial dysbiosis has been associated with hypertension. An extremely high incidence of essential hypertension was found in the Han and the Yugur who resided in Sunan county in East Asias nomadic steppes with little population movement. In attempt to investigate the gut microbial role in hypertension, we recruited a total of 1, 242 Yugur and Han people, who had resided in Sunan County for more than 15 years and accounted for 3% of the local population. The epidemiological survey of 1,089 individuals indicated their nearly 1.8 times higher prevalence of hypertension (38.2-43.3%) than the average in China (23.2%), under a special high-calorie diet based on wheat, cattle, mutton, and animal offal. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the fecal samples of 153 individuals revealed that certain Lachnospiraceae genera were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, P = 5.46 x 10-6), systolic blood pressure (SBP, P = 7.22 x 10-3), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, P = 1.8 x 10-3). HDL-C was positively correlated with SBP (P = 0.023). We further observed that serum butyrate content was lower in both Han (P = 1.99 x 10-3) and Yugur people (P = 0.031) with hypertension than those without hypertension. This study gives a novel insight into the role of gut microbial dysbiosis in hypertension modulation under a high-calorie diet, where the notable depletion of Lachnospiraceae genera might lead to less production of butyrate, contributing to the lower level of HDL-C, and elevating blood pressure in hypertension.\n\nIMPORTANCEDietary nutrients can be converted by gut microbiota into metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, which may serve as disease-preventing agents in hypertension. Due to limited population mobility and a unique high-calorie dietary habit, the recruited cohort in this study could be a representative for elucidating the associations between gut microbiota and hypertension under high-calorie diet. Moreover, low levels of HDL-C have previously been associated with an increased risk of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Our findings provide a new insight that low levels of HDL-C may be a potential medium between depletion of Lachnospiraceae genera and hypertension under high-calorie diet, which might also be a potential candidate for other CVDs.",

To explore which ERVs get co-opted and why, we tracked the epigenetic fate of murine IAPEz elements using an in vitro model of embryonic stem cell (ESC) to neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation. TRIM28-repression depended on a 190bp sequence, previously shown to confer IAPEzs with retrotransposition activity. A subset of IAPEzs ([~]15%) exhibit genetic divergence from this sequence, which we term escapees. While repressed IAPEzs succumb to a previously undocumented epigenetic handover from H3K9me3 in ESCs to H3K27me3 in NPCs, escapee IAPEzs evade repression, resulting in their transcriptional derepression in NPCs. Escapee IAPEzs enhance expression of nearby neural genes and contribute to gene expression differences between mouse strains, which we discern by employing IAPEz insertion polymorphisms.

    "abstract": "Up to 93% of the human genome may show evidence of transcription, yet annotated transcripts account for less than 5%. It is unclear what makes up this major discrepancy, and to what extent the excess transcription has a definable biological function, or is just a pervasive byproduct of non-specific RNA polymerase binding and transcription initiation. Understanding the default state of the genome would be informative in determining whether the observed pervasive activity has a definable function. The genome of any modern organism has undergone billions of years of evolution, making it unclear whether any observed genomic activity, or lack thereof, has been selected for. We sought to address this question by introducing a completely novel 100-kb locus into the genomes of two eukaryotic organisms, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus, and characterizing its genomic activity based on chromatin accessibility and transcription. The locus was designed by reversing (but not complementing) the sequence of the human HPRT1 locus, including [~]30-kb of both upstream and downstream regulatory regions, allowing retention of sequence features like repeat frequency and GC content but ablating coding information and transcription factor binding sites. We also compared this reversed locus with a synthetic version of the normal human HPRT1 locus in both organismal contexts. Despite neither the synthetic HPRT1 locus nor its reverse version coding for any promoters evolved for gene expression in yeast, we observed widespread transcriptional activity of both loci. This activity was observed both when the loci were present as episomes and when chromosomally integrated, although it did not correspond to any of the known HPRT1 functional regulatory elements. In contrast, when integrated in the mouse genome, the synthetic HPRT1 locus showed transcriptional activity corresponding precisely to the HPRT1 coding sequence, while the reverse locus displayed no activity at all. Together, these results show that genomic sequences with no coding information are active in yeast, but relatively inactive in mouse, indicating a potentially major difference in \"default genomic states\" between these two divergent eukaryotes.",

To overcome this limitation, we present the Ribosome Angle Decomposition (RAD) method, where the orientation of each small subunit head and body is described in terms of three angular coordinates (rotation, tilt and tilt direction) and a single translation. To demonstrate the utility of the accompanying software (RADtool) we applied it to all published ribosome and mitoribosome structures. This identified and analyzed 1077 fully-assembled ribosome complexes, as well as 280 isolated small subunits from 48 organisms. The RAD approach quantitatively distinguishes between previously described qualitative rotational features, determines when rotation-only descriptions are insufficient, and shows that tilt-like rearrangements of the SSU head and body are pervasive in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. Together, the presented database and technique provide a robust platform for systematically analyzing, visualizing, and comparing subunit orientations of ribosomes from all kingdoms of life. Accordingly, the RAD resource establishes a common foundation with which structural, simulation, single-molecule and biochemical efforts can precisely interrogate the dynamics of this prototypical molecular machine.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen availability is critical for microbes as some are obligatorily dependent on oxygen for energy conservation. However, aerobic microbes that live in environments with varying oxygen concentrations experience pressures over evolutionary time, selecting alternative energy metabolisms that relax the dependence on oxygen. One such capacity is extracellular electron transfer (or EET), which is the ability to transfer electrons from central metabolism to extracellular oxidants such as iron and manganese oxides. We posit that the {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, highly specialized lineages heretofore recognized as strict aerobes, can be capable of EET as they have been constantly observed in oxygen-limiting and depleted environments. Here, we show that a strictly aerobic ammonia-oxidizer, Nitrosomonas communis, utilized a poised electrode to maintain metabolic activity in anoxic conditions. The presence and activity of multi-heme cytochromes suggested that direct electron transfer is the mechanism underlying EET. Molecular clock models suggest that the ancestors of {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers appeared after the oxygenation of Earth when the oxygen levels were >10-4 pO2 (PAL), suggesting their aerobic origins. Phylogenetic reconciliations of gene and species trees show that the multi-heme c-type EET proteins in Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira were acquired by gene transfer from {beta}-proteobacteria during oxygen scarcity. The preservation of EET metabolism over billions of years under fluctuating oxygen levels and aspects of EET physiology in {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers might explain how they have been coped with oxygen stress and survived under oxygen deprivation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMetabolic versatility can permit typically aerobic microbes to survive in anaerobic conditions when oxygen is deficient as a terminal electron acceptor. This article demonstrates a previously unidentified anaerobic extracellular electron transfer metabolism that operates in aerobic {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers and reconstructs the evolutionary history of this metabolism, linking it to the early history of Earths oxygenation. Our approach contributes to the understanding of metabolisms in the N-cycle and their evolution on Earth, as well as how aerobic microbes manage to retain energy generation under oxygen-limiting or depleted conditions.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAG designed the physiological research with PRG and the phylogenetic research with GF; AG performed the research, AG analyzed the data with PRG and GF.

    "abstract": "Sequence verification is essential for plasmids used as critical reagents or therapeutic products. Here, we describe a cost-effective and accurate plasmid sequencing and consensus generation procedure using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION device as an alternative to commercial plasmid sequencing options. This procedure can verify the identity of a pure population of plasmid, either confirming it matches the known and expected sequence, or identifying mutations present in the plasmid if any exist. We use a full MinION flow cell per plasmid, maximizing available data and allowing for stringent quality filters. Pseudopairing reads for consensus basecalling reduces error rates to 0.53 %, and our pileup consensus approach provides per-base counts and confidence scores, allowing for interpretation of the resulting consensus sequences. For pure plasmid samples, we demonstrate 100 % accuracy in the resulting consensus sequence, and the sensitivity to detect small mutations such as insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide variants. In cases where the sequenced pool of plasmids contains subclonal templates, detection sensitivity is similar to that of traditional capillary sequencing. Our pipeline can provide significant cost savings compared to outsourcing clinical-grade sequencing of plasmids, making generation of high-quality plasmid sequence for clinical sequence verification more accessible.",

    "abstract": "Loss of oral tolerance (LOT) to gluten, characterized by a T helper 1 (Th1) gluten-specific immune response, is a hallmark of celiac disease (CeD) and can be triggered by enteric viral infections. We hypothesized that certain gut microbes have the capacity to protect against virus-mediated LOT. By using our previously defined reovirus-mediated LOT CeD model, we discovered that the gut colonizing protist Tritrichomonas (T.) arnold promotes oral tolerance and protects against reovirus-mediated LOT by suppressing the reovirus-induced proinflammatory program of dietary-antigen-presenting CD103+ dendritic cells. Importantly, T. arnold did not affect antiviral host immunity, suggesting that T. arnold-mediated protection against T1L-induced LOT is not attributable to differences in antiviral host responses. Additionally, using gnotobiotic mice, we found that Tritrichomonas arnold colonization is sufficient to protect against reovirus-mediated LOT in the absence of the microbiota. Mechanistically, we show that Tritrichomonas arnold colonization restrains reovirus-induced inflammatory responses in dendritic cells and thus limit their ability to promote Th1 immune responses ex vivo. Finally, our studies using human stool samples support a role for Tritrichomonas sp. colonization in protecting against development of CeD. This study will motivate the design of effective therapies to prevent LOT to gluten in at-risk individuals and to reinstate tolerance to gluten in CeD patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTritrichomonas arnold protects against virus-mediated loss of oral tolerance to gluten and is underrepresented in celiac disease patients.",

    "abstract": "The Bacillus cereus group is a species complex of the Bacillus genus that includes several closely related species. Within this group, bacteria indicated as B. cereus sensu stricto (B. cereus) are the causative agent of two different types of gastrointestinal diseases associated with food poisoning. Outbreaks of this opportunistic pathogen are generally due to the resistance of its spores to heat, pH and desiccation that makes hard their complete inactivation from food products. B. cereus is commonly isolated from a variety of environments, including intestinal samples of infected and healthy people. We report the genomic and physiological characterization of MV19, a human intestinal strain closely related (ANI value of 98.81%) to the reference strain B. cereus ATCC 14579. MV19 cells were able to grow in a range of temperatures between 20 and 44{degrees}C. At the optimal temperature the sporulation process was induced very rapidly and mature spores efficiently released, however these appeared structurally and morphologically defective. At the sub-optimal growth temperature of 25{degrees}C sporulation was slow and less efficient but a high total number of fully functional spores was produced. Altogether, results reported here indicate that the reduced rapidity and efficiency of sporulation at 25{degrees}C are compensated by a high quality and quantity of released spores, suggesting the relevance of different performances at different growth conditions for the adaptation of this bacterium to diverse environmental niches.",

    "abstract": "Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) is an essential but potentially toxic cellular cofactor. While most organisms are heme prototrophs, many microorganisms can utilize environmental heme as iron source. The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans can utilize host heme in the iron-poor host environment, using an extracellular cascade of soluble anchored hemophores, and plasma membrane ferric reductase-like proteins. To gain additional insight into the C. albicans heme uptake pathway, we performed an unbiased genetic selection for mutants resistant to the toxic heme analog Ga3+-protoporphyrin IX at neutral pH, and a secondary screen for inability to utilize heme as iron source. Among the mutants isolated were the genes of the pH-responsive RIM pathway, and a zinc finger transcription factor, HUF1. In the presence of hemin in the medium, HUF1 is induced, the Huf1 protein is stabilized and Huf1-GFP localizes to the nucleus. In the huf1 mutant, cytoplasmic heme levels are elevated, while influx of extracellular heme is lower. Gene expression analysis indicated that in the presence of extracellular hemin, Huf1 activates the heme oxygenase HMX1, which breaks down excess cytoplasmic heme, while at the same time it also activates all the known heme uptake genes. These results indicate that Huf1 is a heme-responsive transcription factor that plays a role both in cytoplasmic heme homeostasis and in utilization of extracellular heme. The induction of heme uptake genes by Huf1 under iron satiety indicates that preferential utilization of host heme can be a dietary strategy in a heme prototroph.",

We determined the arginine methylation and phosphorylation landscape of the Pumilio domain-containing RBP Puf4 from the basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. We found that methyl-deficient Puf4 mutants do not complement critical PUF4 deletion phenotypes, such as resistances to endoplasmic reticulum stress and antifungals, and cell wall remodeling. Methyl-deficient mutants also exhibit unique RNA and protein interactions. Lastly, we identified intra-protein cross talk between post-translationally modified methylated and phosphorylated residues. Overall, we show that post-translational modifications, particularly arginine methylation, of Puf4 regulate the functions of this RBP.",

In addition to the activation of this small GTPase, fluorescence microscopy allowed us to demonstrate the relocalization of Rap1b to the entry site of the parasite. Moreover, phospho-mimetic and non-phosphorylable mutants of Rap1b were used to demonstrate a PKA-dependent antagonistic effect on the pathway, by phosphorylation of Rap1b, and potentially of Epac.

    "abstract": "BackgroundS. aureus is a major pathogen in India, causing nosocomial infections, but little is known about its molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance in hospital settings. Here, we use WGS to characterize 508 S. aureus clinical isolates collected across India and analyze them in a global context.\n\nMethodsWhole-genome sequencing was performed on 508 clinical isolates of S. aureus collected from 17 sentinel sites across India between 2014 and 2019 with the Illumina platform. AMR genotypes were predicted using Staphopia. Isolates carrying novel SCCmec cassettes were further characterized using long-read sequencing. A temporal analysis of clonal complex (CC) 22 global isolates from 14 different studies was performed using BactDating.\n\nResultsSequencing results confirmed 478 isolates as S. aureus. ST22, ST772 & ST239 were the major clones identified. An in-depth analysis of the 175 CC22 Indian isolates identifies two novel ST22 MRSA clones, PVL+ and one harboring the tsst-1 gene. Temporal analysis showed that these two ST22 clusters shared a common ancestor in the 1980s and they became widespread after the year 2000 in India. Analyzing these in a global context, we found evidence of transmission of the two Indian clones to other parts of the world.\n\nConclusionOur study describes a large retrospective S. aureus sampled from India. By comparing the Indian isolates globally we show the evidence of the international transmission of ST22 Indian isolates. Even though the two of the major dominant clones (ST772 and ST239) using WGS have been reported, this is the first study that describes the third dominant clone (ST22) in India.\n\nImpact statementStaphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen listed as a high-priority pathogen by WHO. It is a leading cause of nosocomial infections in India and worldwide. Our study is the first study to describe the epidemiology of S. aureus in India with a large sample set of 478. Here we describe a collection of 478 S. aureus genomes, isolated from 17 sentinel sites in India, between 2014 and 2019. With the focus on understanding sequence types, AMR profiles, SCCmec types, and spa types and discuss these in the context of previous molecular studies on S. aureus conducted in India. We also conducted an in-depth analysis of the Clonal Complex 22 Indian isolates and we identified two novel ST22 MRSA clones, both PVL+ and one harboring the tsst-1 gene. Temporal analysis shows that these two ST22 clusters originated around 2010 in India. Analyzing these in a global context, we found evidence of transmission of the two Indian clones in other parts of the world. Analysis of a cluster of 33 isolates belonging to ST239 from a single hospital in Bangalore indicates an outbreak that persisted over the period of three years from a single contamination source. The novel SCCmec types identified in our study are characterized using long reads to understand their genetic structure.\n\nData SummaryO_LIIllumina read files of the strains used in the study have been deposited in European Nucleotide Archive, BioProject PRJEB29740 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB29740?show=reads).

The ROS-influenced PMD quantifies cytoplasmic membrane thickness and measures sensitivity against most bactericidal antibiotics, depending upon the extent of lipid peroxidation.

    "abstract": "Macroendocytosis comprising phagocytosis and macropinocytosis are actin-driven processes regulated by small GTPases that depend on the dynamic reorganization of the membrane that protrudes and internalizes extracellular material by cup-shaped structures. To effectively capture, enwrap, and internalize their targets, these cups are arranged into a peripheral ring or ruffle of protruding actin sheets emerging from an actin-rich, non-protrusive zone at its base. Despite extensive knowledge of the mechanism driving actin assembly of the branched network at the protrusive cup edge, which is initiated by the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex downstream of Rac signaling, our understanding of actin assembly in the base is still incomplete. In the Dictyostelium model system, the Ras-regulated formin ForG was previously shown to specifically contribute to actin assembly at the cup base. Loss of ForG is associated with a strongly impaired macroendocytosis and a 50% reduction of F-actin content at the base of phagocytic cups, in turn indicating the presence of additional factors that specifically contribute to actin formation at the base. Here, we show that ForG synergizes with the Rac-regulated formin ForB to form the bulk of linear filaments at the cup base. Consistently, combined loss of both formins virtually abolishes cup formation and leads to severe defects of macroendocytosis, emphasizing the relevance of converging Ras- and Rac-regulated formin pathways in assembly of linear filaments in the cup base, which apparently provide mechanical support to the entire structure. Remarkably, we finally show that active ForB, unlike ForG, additionally drives phagosome rocketing to aid particle internalization.\n\nSignificance StatementCup formation in macroendocytosis is a decisive, actin-dependent process that relies on distinct actin assembly factors generating the necessary mechanical forces to drive rearrangements of the plasma membrane and engulfment of extracellular material. Hitherto, in Dictyostelium the Arp2/3 complex and VASP were shown to promote actin assembly at the protrusive rim of phagocytic cups, while the Ras-regulated formin ForG generates about half of the actin filament mass at the base. Here, we show that ForG synergizes with the Rac-regulated formin ForB to form the bulk of filaments at the cup base. Loss of both formins virtually abolishes cup formation and leads to dramatic defects in macroendocytosis, illustrating the relevance of converging Ras- and Rac-regulated signaling pathways in this process.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the main topic of naturalistic speech in a multi-speaker environment is demanding though the availability of visual speech can be beneficial for speech comprehension. Recent studies provided evidence that low-frequency brain rhythms play an important role in the processing of acoustic speech features. However, at present, the neural dynamics of brain rhythms implementing a higher-order semantic system during naturalistic audiovisual speech perception is unknown. Here we investigated information processing carried by low-frequency oscillations in delta and theta bands for audiovisual speech integration for high-level semantic gist processing using a representational interaction approach. By manipulating the degree of high-level semantic content (speech chunks with high versus low topic probability) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling algorithm and complexity of speaker environment (single versus multi-speaker), we first found that delta and theta phase exert distinctive roles in high-level semantic processing where delta phase represents auditory and visual inputs synergistically whereas theta band does so redundantly. Next, we show both forms of representational interaction are observed to be greater for speech with low semantic gist, supported by speech comprehension and white matter tractography. Furthermore, we show that the delta phase-specific synergistic interaction in the right auditory, temporal, and inferior frontal areas is sensitive to the speaker environment, whereas theta band activity showing redundant representations is sensitive to semantic content. Our results shed new light on dynamic neural mechanisms of implementing higher-order semantic systems through representational interactions between audiovisual speech information and differential roles of delta and theta bands depending on the speaker environment.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain and striatal dopamine signals have been extremely well characterized over the past several decades, yet novel dopamine signals and functions in reward learning and motivation continue to emerge. A similar characterization of real-time sub-second dopamine signals in areas outside of the striatum has been limited. Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit measurement of dopamine binding correlates, which can divulge basic functions of dopamine signaling in non-striatal dopamine terminal regions, like the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). The dBNST receives dense dopaminergic input from several regions including the ventral tegmental area, ventral periacqueductal gray, and substantia nigra. Here, we record fluorescent GRABDA signals in the dBNST during a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task that has established individual differences in cue-evoked striatal dopamine signals in sign- and goal-tracking rats. We observe greater Pavlovian cue-evoked dBNST GRABDA signals in sign-tracking (ST) compared to goal-tracking/intermediate (GT/INT) rats. We find the magnitude of cue-evoked dBNST GRABDA signals decrease immediately following reinforcer-specific satiety. When we deliver unexpected reward or omit expected reward, we find that dBNST dopamine signals encode bidirectional reward prediction errors in GT/INT rats, but only positive prediction errors in ST rats. Since sign- and goal-tracking approach strategies are associated with distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, we examined the effects of experimenter-administered and self-administered fentanyl on dBNST dopamine associative encoding. Systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt dBNST cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. Fentanyl self-administration experience is sufficient to reverse reward seeking and dBNST dopamine signals, which discriminate fentanyl-associated active vs. inactive lever pressing under extinction conditions. These results reveal multiple dBNST dopamine correlates of learning and motivation that depend on the Pavlovian approach strategy employed.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has identified cortical regions selectively responsive to specific categories of visual stimuli. However, this hypothesis-driven work cannot reveal how prominent these category selectivities are in the overall functional organization of visual cortex, or what others might exist that scientists have not thought to look for. Further, standard voxel-wise tests cannot detect distinct neural selectivities that coexist within voxels. To overcome these limitations, we used data-driven voxel decomposition methods to identify the main components underlying fMRI responses to thousands of complex photographic images (Allen et al 2021). Our hypothesis-neutral analysis rediscovered components selective for faces, places, bodies, and words, validating our method and showing that these selectivities are dominant features of the ventral visual pathway. The analysis also revealed an unexpected component with a distinct anatomical distribution that responded highly selectively to images of food. Alternative accounts based on low to mid-level visual features like color, shape or texture failed to account for the food selectivity of this component. High-throughput testing and control experiments with matched stimuli on a highly accurate computational model of this component confirm its selectivity for food. We registered our methods and hypotheses before replicating them on held-out participants and in a novel dataset. These findings demonstrate the power of data-driven methods, and show that the dominant neural responses of the ventral visual pathway include not only selectivities for faces, scenes, bodies, and words, but also the visually heterogeneous category of food, thus constraining accounts of when and why functional specialization arises in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation of T and B cells to effector and memory cell fates are associated with extensive metabolic changes which are accompanied by altered mitochondrial dynamics. However, whether alterations in mitochondrial structure and function plays an active role in regulating effector versus memory cell fate decisions during immune responses remains unclear. Our studies here characterize changes in mitochondrial dynamics in activated B cells and show that increased mitochondrial mass and activity is a distinct feature of memory B cell lineage commitment in vivo. Using a directed screen of mitochondrial modulators, we identify mitochondrial fission inhibitor, Mdivi-1 as an agent that could enhance mitochondrial mass and function leading to augmented memory B cell differentiation. The enhanced memory B cell responses mediated by Mdivi-1, translated to more robust recall responses upon secondary antigen exposures. Moreover, Mdivi-1 when used in combination with subunit (SARS-CoV2) and inactivated (H1N1 influenza) vaccines led to remarkably improved vaccine efficacies and protection from lethal viral (H1N1) challenge. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed enhanced commitment to memory lineage differentiation in B cells following Mdivi-1 treatment. We propose that mitochondrial modulators such as Mdivi-1 are a novel class of \"immune enhancers\" that specifically reinforces immunological memory and could be broadly applied to improve the fidelity of immune responses and vaccine efficacies.",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton is a three-dimensional scaffold of proteins that is a regulatory, energy-consuming network with dynamic properties to shape the structure and function of the cell. Proper actin function is required for many cellular pathways, including cell division, autophagy, chaperone function, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Deterioration of these processes manifests during aging and exposure to stress, which is in part due to the breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in preservation of cytoskeletal form and function are not well understood. Here, we performed a multi-pronged, cross-organismal screen combining a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human fibroblasts with in vivo C. elegans synthetic lethality screening. We identified the bromodomain protein, BET-1, as a key regulator of actin health and longevity. Overexpression of bet-1 preserves actin health at late age and promotes lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans. These beneficial effects are mediated through actin preservation by the transcriptional regulator function of BET-1. Together, our discovery assigns a key role for BET-1 in cytoskeletal health, highlighting regulatory cellular networks promoting cytoskeletal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the footprints of selection in coding sequences can inform about the importance and function of individual sites. Analyses of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous sub-stitutions (dN /dS) have been widely used to pinpoint changes in the intensity of selection, but cannot distinguish them from changes in the direction of selection, i.e., changes in the fitness of specific amino acids at a given position. A few methods that rely on amino acid profiles to detect changes in directional selection have been designed, but their performance have not been well characterized. In this paper, we investigate the performance of 6 of these methods. We evaluate them on simulations along empirical phylogenies in which transition events have been annotated, and compare their ability to detect sites that have undergone changes in the direction or intensity of selection to that of a widely used dN /dS approach, codemls branch-site model A. We show that all methods have reduced performance in the presence of biased gene conversion but not CpG hypermutability. The best profile method, Pelican, a new implementation of [Tamuri et al., 2009], performs as well as codeml in a range of conditions except for detecting relaxations of selection, and performs better when tree length increases, or in the presence of persistent positive selection. It is fast, enabling genome-scale searches for site-wise changes in the direction of selection associated with phenotypic changes.",

    "abstract": "Cooperativity between transcription factors is important to regulate target gene expression. In particular, the binding grammar of TFs in relation to each other, as well as in the context of other genomic elements, is crucial for TF functionality. However, tools to easily uncover co-occurrence between DNA-binding proteins, and investigate the regulatory modules of TFs, are limited. Here we present TF-COMB (Transcription Factor Co-Occurrence using Market Basket analysis) - a tool to investigate co-occurring TFs and binding grammar within regulatory regions. We found that TF-COMB can accurately identify known co-occurring TFs from ChIP-seq data, as well as uncover preferential localization to other genomic elements. With the use of ATAC-seq footprinting and TF motif locations, we found that TFs exhibit both preferred orientation and distance in relation to each other, and that these are biologically significant. Finally, we extended the analysis to not only investigate individual TF pairs, but also TF pairs in the context of networks, which enabled the investigation of TF complexes and TF hubs. In conclusion, TF-COMB is a flexible tool to investigate various aspects of TF binding grammar.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496953v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e37cccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1165241org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@725a2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e1893_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
