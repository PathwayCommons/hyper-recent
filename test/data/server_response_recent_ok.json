			"abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment wherein we sampled fluids within the BLA and observed behavioral responses of male and female mice while presenting highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint behaviors. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, the ACh and DA release patterns to mating playback were similar to males. Estrous females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Across these groups, increased ACh concentration was correlated with an increase in defensive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound-analyzing BLA neurons that modulates their output to downstream brain regions responsible for appropriate behavioral outcomes.",

			"abstract": "Na+\/H+ antiporters are major secondary transporters that regulate pH and sodium homeostasis by enabling transmembrane exchanges of Na+ with H+ in opposite directions, both are essential cations. Although their crystal structures have been well characterized1-3, the transport dynamics of Na+\/H+ antiporters during action in living cells remained largely unexplored. Herein, intermittent blinking of the spontaneous bioluminescence from single native bioluminescent bacteria, P. phosphoreum, was reported, investigated and attributed to the stochastic gating of Na+\/H+ antiporters between the active and inactive conformations. Each gating event caused the rapid depolarization and recovery of membrane potential within several seconds, accompanying with the intermittent bioluminescence blinking due to the transient inhibitions on the activity of respiratory chain. Temperature-dependent measurements further revealed that the conformational change was thermodynamically driven with an activation energy barrier of 20.3 kJ\/mol. While the stochastic gating of ion channels has been well understood for decades4,5, this study uncovered the stochastic gating dynamics of Na+\/H+ antiporters, another major pathway for ion transmembrane transports, in single native bacteria without any genetic engineering or chemical labeling. It also opened the door for P. phosphoreum to serve as new model bacteria for reporting the physiological and metabolic status with spontaneous bioluminescence emission.",

			"abstract": "Single cell genomics provides a high-resolution profile of intratumoral heterogeneity and subclonal structure in primary and metastatic tumors. Notably, metastases and therapeutic resistant tumors often originate from distinct subclones. These distinct cellular populations are an important contributor to adaptation and resistance to ongoing therapy. Single cell DNA-sequencing (scDNA-seq) defines subclones but does not provide biological information about cell types. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides biological information but is less useful for identifying different subclones. The integrated scDNA-seq and scRNA-seq data from the same tumor cell population provides both subclone structure and biology. To understand the cellular genomic variation of different subclones in primary and metastatic cancers, we developed an approach to integrate multi-omics data from both types of single cells. This joint data set represented thousands of normal and tumor cells derived from a set of primary gastric and metastatic colorectal cancers. The extensive cellular sampling provided robust characterization of the subclonal architecture of gastric and colorectal cancers. We reconstructed the subclonal architecture using the cells in G0\/G1 phase. The scDNA-seq provided a ground truth for copy number-based subclones. From the scRNA-seq data, the epithelial cells in G0\/G1 were identified and assigned to specific subclones by a correlation algorithm based on gene dosage. The inferred CNV profiles from the scRNA-seq epithelial cells were assigned subclones identified from the scDNA-seq. Afterward, we determined the biological pathway activities of specific clones. Overall, integrative multi-omics analysis of single-cell datasets is more informative than any individual genomic modality, provides deep insights into the intratumoral heterogeneity, and reveals subclonal biology.",

			"abstract": "SRRM2 is a nuclear-speckle marker containing multiple disordered domains, whose dysfunction is associated with several human diseases. Using mainly EGFP-SRRM2 knock-in HEK293T cells, we show that SRRM2 forms biomolecular condensates satisfying most hallmarks of liquid-liquid phase separation, including spherical shape, dynamic rearrangement, coalescence, and concentration dependence supported by in vitro experiments. Live-cell imaging shows that SRRM2 organizes nuclear speckles along the cell cycle. As bona-fide splicing factor present in spliceosome structures, SRRM2 deficiency induces skipping of cassette exons with short introns and weak splice sites, tending to change large protein domains. In THP-1 myeloid-like cells, SRRM2 depletion compromises cell viability, upregulates differentiation markers, and sensitizes cells to anti-leukemia drugs. SRRM2 induces a FES splice isoform that attenuates innate inflammatory responses, and MUC1 isoforms that undergo shedding with oncogenic properties. We conclude that SRRM2 acts as a scaffold to organize nuclear speckles, regulating alternative splicing in innate immunity and cell homeostasis.",

			"abstract": "Although cell size regulation is crucial for cellular functions in a variety of organisms, from bacteria to humans, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify Rim21, a component of the pH- sensing Rim101 pathway, as a positive regulator of cell size through a genome-wide screen of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants. We found that mutants defective in the Rim101 pathway were consistently smaller than wild-type cells in the log and stationary phases. The expression of the active form of Rim101 increased the size of wild- type cells. Furthermore, the size of wild-type cells increased in response to external alkalization, which was associated with changes in both vacuolar and cytoplasmic volume. These volume changes were dependent on Rim21 and Rim101. A mutant lacking Vph1, a component of V-ATPase that is transcriptionally regulated by Rim101, was also smaller than wild-type cells, with no increase in size in response to alkalization. The loss of Vph1 suppressed the Rim101-induced increase in cell size under physiological pH conditions. Our results suggest that the cell size of budding yeast is regulated by the Rim101 and V-ATPase axis under physiological conditions as well as in response to alkaline stresses.",

			"abstract": "TAR DNA\/RNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which cytoplasmic aggregates containing TDP-43 and its C-terminal fragments, such as TDP25, are observed in degenerative neuronal cells. However, few reports have focused on small molecules that can reduce their aggregation and cytotoxicity. Here, we show that short RNA repeats of GGGGCC and AAAAUU are molecular chaperones (i.e., chaperone RNAs) that can reduce proteotoxicity by preventing the aggregation of TDP-43 and TDP25. TDP25 interacts with these RNAs, as well as TDP-43, despite the lack of major RNA-recognition motifs, using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. Expression of these RNAs significantly decreases the cells harboring cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 and TDP25 and ameliorates rounded and shrinking cells by mislocalized TDP-43; furthermore, the cellular transcriptome is not altered. Consequently, these RNAs are molecular chaperones against the aggregation of TDP-43 and TDP25.",

			"abstract": "Metal ions present in cellular microenvironment have been implicated as drivers of aggregation of amyloid forming proteins. Zinc (Zn2+) ions have been reported to directly interact with -synuclein (AS), a causative agent of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, and promote its aggregation. AS is a small intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) i.e., understanding molecular factors that drive its misfolding and aggregation has been challenging since methods used routinely to study protein structure are not effective for IDPs. Here, we report the atomic details of Zn2+ binding to AS at physiological conditions using proton-less NMR techniques that can be applied to highly dynamic systems like IDPs. We also examined how human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in human blood, binds to AS and whether Zn2+ and\/or ionic strength affect this. We conclude that Zn2+ enhances the anti-aggregation chaperoning role of HSA that relies on protecting the hydrophobic N-terminal and NAC regions of AS, rather than polar negatively charged C-terminus. This suggested a previously undocumented role of Zn2+ in HSA function and AS aggregation.",

			"abstract": "Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of cancer are powerful tools to study mechanisms of disease progression and therapy response, yet little is known about how these models respond to multimodality therapy used for curative intent in patients. Radiation therapy (RT) is frequently used to treat localized cancers with curative intent, delay progression of oligometastases, and palliate symptoms of metastatic disease. RT can be combined with surgery, systemic therapy, and\/or immunotherapy for definitive treatment of solid tumors. Here we report the development, testing, and validation of a murine platform that faithfully emulates human stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). We demonstrate that SABR regimens used in clinical practice can be effectively delivered in mouse models and establish the intestinal tract as the dose limiting organ for abdominopelvic radiation with notable, but transient, lymphodepletion. SABR alters tumor stroma and immune environment, improves survival in GEMMs of primary prostate and colorectal cancer, and synergizes with androgen deprivation in prostate cancer. While SABR is capable of fully ablating xenografts it is unable to completely eradicate disease in GEMMs. These data show that some GEMMs are resistant to curative therapy suggesting the existence of treatment-resistant persister cells in these models.",

			"abstract": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer in which tissue-specific differentiation is paradoxically associated with dismal outcomes. The differentiated ACC subtype CIMP-high is prevalent, incurable, and routinely fatal. CIMP-high ACC possess abnormal DNA methylation and frequent {beta}-catenin activating mutations. Here, we demonstrate that ACC differentiation is maintained by a balance between nuclear, tissue-specific {beta}-catenin-containing complexes and the epigenome. On chromatin, {beta}-catenin binds master adrenal transcription factor SF1 and hijacks the adrenocortical super-enhancer landscape to maintain differentiation. Off chromatin, {beta}-catenin binds histone methyltransferase EZH2, which is redistributed by the CIMP-high DNA methylation signature. SF1\/{beta}-catenin and EZH2\/{beta}-catenin complexes exist in normal adrenals and are selected for through all phases of ACC evolution. Pharmacologic EZH2 inhibition in CIMP-high ACC favors EZH2\/{beta}-catenin assembly and purges SF1\/{beta}-catenin from chromatin, erasing differentiation and restraining cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Our studies illustrate how tissue-specific programs shape oncogene selection, surreptitiously encoding targetable therapeutic vulnerabilities.",
